1. Gupta: (No. 1, L. 28; No. 21, L. 4; No. 22, L. 1; No. 47, L. 1; No. 49, L. 1; No. 50, L. 1; No. 51, L. 2, L. 4; No. 53, L. 1): He was the founder of the family. We have already discussed his name.

2. Ghat2otkaca: (No. 1, L. 28; No. 47, L. 1; No. 53, LL. 1-2; No. 46, L. 1; No. 49, L. 1; No. 50, L. 1; No 40, L. 3; No. 21, L. 4: The inscriptions name Maha1ra1ja1 Ghat2otkaca as the successor of Gupta. He should not be confused with Ghat2otkacagupta whose name occurs on some seals found at Vai1s4a1li1, and also in the Tumain Inscription of Kuma1ragupta and Ghat2otkacagupta (G. E. 116).^46 Ghat2otkaca was the name of a son of Bhi1ma-sena by the Ra1ks2asi1 Hid2imba1.^47 Names based on Ghat2a are very rare in Sanskrit literature. Thus Gan2es4a is named Ghat2odara ‘potbellied’.^48 The name Ghat2otkaca refers to the practice of bearing traditional names based on Epics and Pura1n2as. Derivatively it means a person having a hairless head.^49 In Pra1ci1na Caritrakos4a it has been suggested that Ghat2otkaca was so called as his head was like a ghat2a (pitcher) and was hairless.^50 Tripathi suggests on the basis of the Skanda Pura1n2a that Ghat2otkaca was so called as he produced a loud voice while laughing which may be compared to the voice produced by thumping the pitcher quite aloud at its mouth by hands.^51 But  the first derivation seems to be more plausible from linguistic point of view^52 while the other explanation may be more important from socio-psychological or mythological point of view. It is possible that it was the nickname of Ghat2otkaca which might have become his famous name.

3. Candragupta I: (No. 47, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2; No. 40, L. 3; No. 21, L. 5; No. 1, L. 28; No. 30, L. 1): While his two predecessors are each given the title of Maha1ra1ja, Candragupta I is described in the inscriptions as Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja, ‘king of kings’. Mookerjee connects the passage from the Pura1n2as defining the extent of the Gupta territory with the period before Samudragupta, i.e., under Candragupta I.^53 It has been suggested that Can2d2asena of the play ‘Kaumudi1Mahotsava’ is to be identified with Candragupta I. The Licchavi alliance is the common point in the account given by the drama and the inscriptions.^54 Other details of the drama, however, do not support this identification. The drama condemns Can2d2asena as an usurper and belonging to low caste whom the citizens of Magadha could not tolerate and drove out to die in exile. Linguistically also Can2d2asena and Candragupta are different names. Candra can become Can2d2a in Prakrit but Gupta cannot be transformed into Sena. Moreover, in the fifth act of the play we are informed through a character Loka1ks2i1 that the cursed Can2d2asena has been killed and his royal family uprooted.^55 Thus we know about the total annihilation of the dynasty after the death of Can2d2asena which is not applicable to the dynasty of Can2d2ragupta which ruled for several generations after him.^56 The name of the deity Candra ‘moon’ has been given to this king; Gupta is the surname. It may refer to his handsome physical features.

4. Samudragupta (No. 1, L. 29; No. 47, L. 3; No. 53, L. 3; No. 21, LL. 6-7; No. 2, L. 10; No. 40, L. 4; No. 41, L. 1; No. 10, L. 4; No. 49, L. 3; No. 50, L. 3; No. 13, L. 4; No. 12, L. 19): He is introduced as Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja in all references except the Mathura1 Pillar Inscription of Candragupta II, G.E. 61^57 where he is mentioned as Bhat2t2a1rakamaha1ra1ja ra1ja1dhira1ja. He was the daughter's son of the Licchavis, and son of Maha1ra1ja1 dhira1ja S4ri1 Candragupta I born on the queen Kuma1radevi1.^58 He has been mentioned as a ‘Paramabha1gavata’ (a devout devotee of Lord Vis2n2u).^59 No. 2, L. 10 gives the justification of his name Samudragupta.^60 Mookerji says that the name Samudragupta was probably a title assumed after his conquests. It means ‘protected by the sea’ and may refer to his dominion which extended upto the sea. The Mathura1 Inscription of Candragupta II actually describes the fame of his conquests as extending up to the four oceans (caturudadhisalila1sva1ditayas4asah2). The name Samudragupta may be split up into two parts, Samudra being his personal name, and Gupta being his surname. This is supported by the fact that the obverse of his coins of standard type sometimes bears the legend ‘Samudra’ while the reverse has ‘Para1kramah2’ as his title. The name ‘Samudra’ also appears on some other types of his coins, such as the Archer type and Battle-Axe type.^61 Mookerji^62 holds that Samudragupta's personal name was Ka1ca and that Samudragupta was his title. But the identification of Ka1ca with Samudragupta has been rightly opposed by scholars.^63 Va1mana in his Ka1vyalam3ka1ra^64 refers to Candrapraka1s4a as the son of Candragupta which Goyal takes to be another name of Samudragupta.^65 But it seems to be the name of a local king of Ayodhya1 rather than that of a member of the Imperial Gupta dynasty.^66 Another probable and most suitable explanation of the name ‘Samudragupta’ may be ‘protected by Lord S4iva’, Samudra being an epithet of S4iva.^67 Samudragupta is given many epithets in No. 1. Some of these are also supported by numismatic evidence.^68

5. Candragupta II: (No. 30, L. 1, L. 2; No. 32, L. 2; No. 47, L. 4; No. 3, L. 1; No. 7, L. 1; No. 6, L. 1; No. 7, L. 10; No. 46, L. 3; No. 53, L. 4; No. 42, L. 1; No. 47, L. 4; No. 41, L. 2; No. 39, L. 1, L. 6; No. 5. L. 3, L. 7; No. 20, L. 5): He is mentioned as ‘apratiratha’, ‘paramabha1gavata’ ‘maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja’ and a son of maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja S4ri1 Samudragupta born of his chief queen Dattadevi1;^69 or as Bhat2t2a1raka-maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja, the good son of the Bhat2t2a1raka-maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja, the illustrious Samudragupta;^70 or in one case simply as a king (ra1ja1) in No. 30, L. 1. In No, 46, L. 3, L. 4. his title is ‘Vikrama1ditya’. He is  mentioned by other names as well. Devara1ja as his favourite name (priyana1ma) is mentioned in No. 5, L. 7.^71 In the Poona copper plate inscription of Prabha1vati1gupta1 and the Ridhapura grants of Prabha1vati1gupta1 her father's name is Candragupta.^72 The Chammak copper plate inscription of Va1ka1t2aka king Pravarasena II, however, names Prabha1vati1gupta1's father as Devagupta.^73 This proves that Devagupta was another name of Candragupta. Candragupta had a third name, Deva-S4ri1, which appears on his Archer and Conch-types of Coins.^74 No. 32, L. 2 Justifies his name Candragupta ‘who is like a moon in the galaxy of Gupta kings with the famous name Candragupta’.^75 No. 20, L. 5 refers to his quality of handsomeness. ‘His name was Candra and he was holding the glory of a full moon on his face’.^76

6. Govindagupta: (No. 42, L. 2; No. 32, L. 3): In No. 42, he is mentioned as the son of Candragupta II. His mother's name was Dhruvasva1mini1. No. 32 explains the basis of his name: “The lord of the earth, i.e. king Candragupta, produced a son whose exalted name was Govindagupta, who was as famous as Govinda (Vis2n2u) for the glory of his virtues, and who resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi, i.e. the demons and gods.”^77 The poet means that Govindagupta resembled demons in physical strength and valour, and gods in spiritual virtues. Govindagupta probably ruled as emperor between (his father) Candragupta II and (his younger brother) Kuma1ragupta 1. His reign could not have been more than three years, the interval between the last known date of Candragupta II (G. E. 93) and the earliest known date of Kuma1ragupta I (G.E. 96).^78 P. L. Gupta assigns his short regnal period between A.D. 412 and 415.^79 That Govindagupta could have ruled as emperor only for a very short period is also evident from the fact that he has left no coins. Being a collateral, Govindagupta does not appear in the genealogical table in the inscriptions of Kuma1ragupta and his successors.^80 It is also likely that Kuma1ragupta defeated or ousted Govindagupta and seized the throne; and after his accession, avoided all references to his elder brother.^81

7. Kuma1ragupta I: (No. 30, L. 2; No. 53, L. 5; No. 49, L. 5;  No. 50, L. 5; No. 39, L. 7; No. 17, L. 13; No. 30, L. 4; No. 31, L. 1; No. 39, L. 3; No. 46, L. 4; No. 35, LL. 1-2; No. 34, L. 2): No. 30, L. 2 says that S4ri1 Candragupta's son Kuma1rgupta resembled the great Indra (Mahendra), who embraced and protected the whole earth.^82 In No. 53, L. 5 Kuma1ragupta is mentioned as ‘Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja’ son of ‘paramabha1gavata Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja S4ri1 Candragupta’ born of the cheif queen Dhruvadevi1. He has been mentioned as father of Pu1rugupta and son of Candragupta II.^83 In No. 30, L. 4 Kuma1ragupta is described as shining (ruling) over the earth like the Sun in the winter. He is called ‘Paramabhat2t2a1raka’ and ‘Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja’ in No. 31, L. 1. In No. 46, L. 4 he is mentioned only by his title ‘Mahendra1ditya’, and as the grandson of Samudragupta and son of Candragupta II. The A1rya-Man5ju-S4ri1-Mu1lakalpa corroborates the title giving his name as Mahendra.^84 In No. 34, L. 2 he is mentioned as ‘Paramadaivata’, ‘Parmabhat2t2a1raka’ and ‘Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja’. Of the two parts of his name Kuma1ra is the name of god Skanda (or Ka1rttikeya)^85 and Gupta was his surname.

8. Skandagupta (No. 15, L. 3; No. 46, LL. 7-8; No. 14, L. 3; No. 16, L. 3; No. 13, L. 8; No. 12, LL. 6, 11, 23, 25): In No. 15 he is equated with Indra.^86 In No. 46 he is described as equal to the Cakravartins in prowess and valour, to Ra1ma in righteousness and to Yudhis2t2hira in the matter of speaking the truth and in good conduct and modesty.^87 According to some scholars^88 these are vague praises; but in view of his achievements these epithets seem to be richly deserved. In No. 14, L. 2 he is described as ‘ra1jara1ja1dhira1ja’, and as ‘Paramabha1gavata’ and ‘Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja’ in No. 12, LL. 23, 25. The name is based on god Skanda which is a synonym of Ka1rttikeya.

9. Pu1rugupta (No. 47, L. 6; No. 53, L. 6; No. 49, L. 6; No. 50, L. 6; No. 38, L. 1): We know from No. 53 that Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja S4ri1 Pu1rugupta was the son of Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja S4ri1 Kuma1ragupta by his chief queen Anantadevi1. In No. 38, L. 1 the name of the father  and predecessor of Narasim3hagupta is spelt as Pu1rugupta.^89 The reading Pu1rugupta is unmistakeable on the fragmentary Na1landa1 Seal of Narasim3hagupta and is also fairly clear on the seals of Kuma1ragupta II. The medial u1 sign in the first letter of the name Pu1rugupta is indicated by an additional stroke attached to the base of the letter and the downward elongation of its right limb; mere elongation of the right limb by itself would have denoted the short medial u as in puttras in LL. 2 and 3. In the second letter of the name, viz. ru. the medial u is shown by a small hook turned to left and joined to the foot of r. Palaeographical considerations apart, the name Purugupta yields a more plausible-sense than Puragupta and fits better in the series of the grand and dignified names of the Gupta kings. The first part of the Gupta names constituted the real or substantive name and yielded satisfactory meaning independently of the latter half, viz. gupta, which being family surname was a mere adjunct. Pura, by itself is neither a complete nor a dignified name while Puru is both. Pu1ru or its variant Puru may, like Vainya in Vainyagupta signify the homonymous epic hero of the lunar race who was the ancestor of the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas, or may mean abundant or great.^90

कुमारगुप्त
10. Kuma1ragupta II: (No. 48, L. 5): Kuma1ragupta II was the immediate successor of Pu1rugupta in the light of the data given in two dated inscriptions, viz. the Sarnath Buddha Stone Image inscriptions of Kuma1ragupta and Budhagupta. The first (No. 48) mentions A.D. 473 as the date of Kuma1ragupta who must, therefore, be taken as Kuma1ragupta II and the second (No. 54) mentions A.D. 476 as the date of Budhagupta. No. 48 records the date, Gupta year 154^91 when Kuma1ragupta was protecting the earth.^92 The renovation of the Sun temple mentioned in No 17, LL. 20-21 seems to have taken place in his reign.^93 It seems that Mookerji has by mistake, connected the reference^94 meant for Kuma1ragupta I with Kuma1ragupta II.^95 The temple was originally constructed in the reign of Kuma1ragupta I in M.S. 493 = A.D. 436 (L. 19).

बुधगुप्त
11. Budhagupta: (No. 54, L. 1; No. 55, L. 2; No. 18, L. 2; No. 33, L. 1; No. 53, L. 8): Nos. 54, 55, 18 and 33 respectively mention him as reigning in:  G.Y. 157, 159, 163 and 165. No. 33 gives his titles as ‘paramadaivata’, ‘paramabhat2t2a1raka’ and ‘maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja’. In No. 53 he is mentioned as the son of Pu1rugupta born of the queen Candradevi1.^96 In No. 55 his title is Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja. According to Sircar there is no space for the name of any other Gupta prince between Pu1rugupta and Bhudhagupta and their relationship is clearly mentioned by the word ‘putra’ occurring at the end of line 6.^97 In other words pu1rugupta was the father of Budhagupta. In his description of Na1landa1, Hiuen Tsang says that the monastic establishments at that place were enriched by the successive endowments of S4akra1ditya, Budhagupta, Tatha1gatagupta and Ba1la1ditya.^98 On the strength of this statement it has been suggested that Budhagupta was the son of Kuma1ragupta I who had the title of Mahendra1ditya (Mahendra = S4akra).^99 In veiw of the clear epigraphic reference to the parentage of Budhagupta the proposed identification must be rejected.^100 The statement of Hiuen Tsang was based on hearsay and not on sound history, or else his Budhagupta is not to be identified with Budhagupta of the Imperial Gupta line. The name Budhagupta is based on Mercury. Budhism had quite a prominent place in the time of Budhagupta. But in view of the special leaning of Gupta kings towards the brahmanical faith we prefer to interpret Budha as referring to Mercury either as god Mercury (regarded as a son of Soma or the Moon) or as the planet Mercury.^101

नरसिंहगुप्त
12. Narasim3hagupta: (No. 47, L. 8; No. 49, L. 7; No. 50, L. 7; No. 38, L. 2): Narasim3hagupta has been mentioned as ‘Paramabha1gavata’ and ‘Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja’. Hiranand Shastri^102 says that the seal of Narasim3hagupta (No. 47), though not entire is valuable in establishing his identity as the son of Pu1rugupta born of the the queen consort S4ri1 Vainyadevi1 and not Vatsadevi1 as has hitherto been believed. But the correct reading of the name of her mother is S4ri1 Candradevi1, on his seal.^103 In No. 50. L. 6 we find his mother's name as ‘Vatsadevi1’. In No. 49 he is mentioned as the father of Kuma1ragupta III. No. 38 describes the issuer of this seal, Vis2n2ugupta, as the son and successor of Kuma1ragupta III, who in his turn was the son and successor  of Narasim3hagupta. Narasim3ha is the name of Vis2n2u in his fourth incarnation (Avata1ra), half man and half lion who slew the demon Hiran2yakas4ipu and saved the life of Prahla1da.^104

कुमारगुप्त
13. Kuma1ragupta III: (No. 49, L. 8; No. 50, L. 8; No. 38. L. 3; No. 47, L. 5): Kuma1ragupta mentioned in Nos. 49 (L. 8); 50 (L. 8); 38 (L. 3); 47 (L. 5) should be considered as Kuma1rgupta III. He is described as the son and successor of Narasim3hagupta and has been given the title of Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja.

विष्णुगुप्त
14. Vis2n2ugupta (No. 38, L. 4): Vis2n2ugupta is mentioned here as a Paramabha1gavata and Maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja. He was the son and successor of Kuma1ragupta III who in his turn was the son and successor of Narasim3hagupta. Unfortunately the name of the mother of Vis2n2ugupta (and the wife of Kuma1rgupta III) has been lost in the portion of the last line. The Kalighat hoard^105 contained besides Candragupta II's coins those of Narasim3hagupta, Kuma1ragupta III and Vis2n2ugupta. Altekar identified Vis2n2ugupta of the coins with the homonymous ruler of the later Gupta family of Magadha, who flourished in the eighth century A.D.^106 At that time the learned professor had no knowledge of this seal of an earlier Vis2n2ugupta. His name is clearly based on god Vis2n2u. B. Other members of the Dynasty

घटोत्कचगुप्त
1. Ghat2otkacagupta: (No. 45, L. 1; No. 30, L. 3): Ghat2otkacagupta of No. 30 is identical wlth that of No. 45. A distinction must be made between Ghat2otkacagupta and Ghat2otkaca, the latter being the grandfather of Samudragupta. Unfortunately the word expressing the exact relationship between Kuma1ragupta (the ruling emperor) and Ghat2otkacagupta (the provincial governor) is lost in the missing protion of the inscription. He was probably a son or younger brother of Kuma1ragupta I^107 and may have been one of the claimants for the throne after the death of Kuma1ragupta I. Altekar considers him to be a brother of Kuma1ragupta.^108

वैन्यगुप्त
2. Vainyagupta: (No. 51, L. 5; No. 52, L. 1):  Vainya is the synonym for the first king ‘Pr2thu’.^109 Hiranand Shastri mentions Vainya as a synonym of Kubera, the god of wealth. According to Sir Richard Burn Vainya was another name of Vajra whom Hiuen Tsang mentions as the son of Ba1la1ditya. He chiefly relies on the St. Petersburg dictionary where Vainya is derived from Vena and is connected with Indra; Vajra is the thunderbolt and Vainya is a patronymic from Vena who is Indra.^110 But the suggested identification is extremely far-fetched. Vajra cannot by any stretch of imagination be described as a synonym of Vainya. Moreover, it is difficult to believe that Hiuen Tsang would have referred to the king by such a name in preference of the real name. In No. 51 Vainyagupta is mentioned as a paramabha1gavata and maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja, but in No. 53 he is described as a devotee of Lord S4iva (bhagava1n maha1devapa1da1nudhya1ta) and a maha1ra1ja only. Some scholars hold the opinion that it shall be wrong to disconnect Vainyagupta from the Gupta family on the basis of the argument that the Guptas were Vais2n2avas while Vainyagupta professed to be a S4aiva.^111 We find both the epithets ‘paramabha1gavata’ and ‘maha1devapa1da1nudhya1ta’ for him in our records. It is interesting that even his Pa1dada1sa and Uparika are styled as maha1ra1jas (LL. 3 and 16). His title Maha1ra1ja, therefore, cannot prove that Vainyagupta was an insignificant prince.^112 The legend on No. 51, though partially preserved, resembles in point of style the legend on the other seals of the Imperial Guptas. Here Vainyagupta is specifically called paramabha1gavata. Moreover, his name, like those of other kings in the Gupta dynasty ends in the word Gupta. It is thus clear that Vainyagupta belonged to the line of the Imperial Guptas. He seems to have ruled in any case over considerable parts of Bengal and Bihar^113 almost immediately after Budhagupta. We do not know anything about the relationship of Vainyagupta with Budhagupta and Bha1nugupta of the Eran2 Inscription of A.D. 510.^114 Some scholars assign him a reign of four years before Bha1nugupta (A.D. 510).^115 The regnal period of Vainyagupta witnessed a considerable decline in the power and prestige of the Imperial Guptas. The  rise of the ruling dynasty consisting of Dharma1ditya, Gopacandra and Sama1ca1radeva in Central and South-West Bengal in the first half of the sixth Century A.D., possibly points to the extirpation of Gupta rule from Bengal excepting the bhukti (province) of Pun2d2ravardhana (North Bengal).^116

भानुगुप्त
3. Bha1nugupta (No. 19, L. 5): He is known only from No. 19. His no other coin or seal has yet come to light. As regards the position of Bha1nugupta, several alternatives are possible. First, he may have been a successor of Vainyagupta and the dominions of both may have included parts of Eastern Malwa. Second, Vainyagupta may have been the lord of the eastern part of the Gupta Empire when its western part was being ruled by Bha1nugupta. Third, Bha1nugupta may have been a viceroy in the Malwa region like Govindagupta and Ghat2otkacagupta. It is possible that he belonged to the Imperial Gupta line but whether he succeeded Vainygupta, or the two ruled at the same time respectively over the western and eastern parts of the empire, is difficult to determine. The latter view seems more probable and this internal dissension perhaps paved the way for the downfall of the empire.^117 Bha1nugupta, in spite of the high encomiums paid to his bravery in Eran2 Inscription, remains a shadowy figure, and we do not know what was his position in the Gupta Imperial family, or what part he played in the dark days of the Gupta empire.^118 His name is based on the god Sun ‘Bha1nu’. NAMES OF THE GUPTA QUEENS Following are the names of the Gupta queens available in our inscriptions. They have been mentioned as Maha1devi1s. 1. Kuma1radevi1 2. Dattadevi1 3.

कुमारदेवी
1. Kuma1radevi1: (No. 1, L. 29; No. 4, L. 8; No. 10, L. 4;  No. 12, L. 18; No. 13, L. 3; No. 21, LL. 5-6; No. 40, L. 4; No. 47, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2; No. 49. L. 2; No. 50, L. 2): She was the wife of Candragupta I and the mother of Samudragupta. Kuma1ra, the basis of her name has already been explained under Kuma1ragupta.

दत्तदेवी
2. Dattadevi1 (No. 4, L. 10; No. 10, L. 5; No. 12, L. 20; No. 13, L. 4; No. 47, L. 3; No. 53, L. 3; No. 49, L. 3; No. 50, L. 3): She is mentioned as the wife of Samudragupta and the mother of Candragupta II. Datta means ‘given’ or protected.^119 We also find ‘Datta’ as the name-ending suffix for male names in literature. 3 (a) Dhruvadevi1 (No. 53, L. 5; No. 12, L. 21; No. 13, L. 5; No. 49, L. 4; No. 50, L. 4; No. 47, L. 5): She was the mother of Kuma1ragupta I and the wife of Candragupta II. Literally ‘Dhruva’ means unchangeable or constant. It is also the name of the polar star (personified as son of Utta1na-pa1da and grandson of Manu).^120 3 (b). Dhruvasva1mini1 (No. 42, LL. 3-4): We come to know of Dhruvasva1mini1 only in No. 42. Lines 1-3 mention her as the wife of Candragupta II and the mother of Govindagupta. As we have noticed Dhruvadevi1 elsewhere appears as the wife of Candragupta II and mother of Kuma1ragupta I. It is not much likely that Candragupta II had two queens with almost identical names. As the real name of the two is the same (Dhruva) it would be better to hold that Dhruvasva1mini1 was another name of Dhruvadevi1 and Kuma1ragupta I and Govindagupta were real brothers.

अनन्तदेवी
4. Anantadevi1 (No. 49, L. 5; No. 50, L. 5; No. 53, L. 6; No. 47, L. 6): She is mentioned as the wife of Kuma1ragupta I and the mother of Pu1rugupta. According to Monier Williams Ananta is the name alike of Vis2n2u, S4es2a (The Snake-god), S4es2a's brother Va1suki; Kr2s2n2a, his brother Baladeva, S4iva and Rudra; and is also included in the list of the Vis4ve-devas and the Arhats, etc.

चन्द्रदेवी
5. Candradevi1^121 (No. 47, L. 7; No. 53, L. 7): The name of the mother of Budhagupta occurring at the beginning of the extant portion of line 7 is not clearly legible; it  consists of four letters, the first of which is either ca or va and the second is certainly n with some subscript mark or letter; the third and fourth letters clearly read devya1m. It is, therefore, highly probable that her name was Candradevi1, known from some seals to have been the name of the queen of Pu1rugupta. Hiranand Shastri takes the relevant legend to be ‘S4ri1vainyadevya1m’^122 but regards the correct reading to be Candra in place of Vainya.^123 No. 47 mentions Candradevi1 as the name of the mother of Narasim3hagupta. In No. 53 Candradevi1 is mentioned as the mother of Budhagupta and wife of Pu1rugupta. The name Candradevi1 is based on the god Candra (Moon).

श्रीवदेवी
6. S4ri1va(tsa)devi1^124 (No. 49, L. 6; No. 50, L. 6): ‘S4ri1va’ is clearly legible but the terminal ‘tsa’ can only faintly be seen. She is mentioned as the wife of Pu1rugupta and mother of Narasim3hagupta. ‘S4ri1vatsa’ is the name of Vis2n2u, which literally means ‘beloved or favourite of S4ri1’ (Laks2mi1).^125 It is also a symbol or mark of Vis2n2u.^126

मित्रदेवी
7. Mitradevi1 (No. 49, LL. 7-8; No. 50, L. 7): No. 49 mentions maha1devi1 Sumatidevi1 as the wife of Narasim3hagupta and mother of Kuma1ragupta III. Fleet read the name as Maha1laks2mi1devi1^127 and Hoernle as ‘S4ri1mati1devi1’.^128 But in No. 50 the reading is clearly ‘Mitradevi1’.^129 Mitra is one of the several names of the Solar deity.

गणपति
1. Gan2apati (No. 1, L. 13): One of the kings said to have been uprooted by Samudragupta in northern India. The name violates the laws laid down by the Gr2hya-su1tras which prohibit the giving of the names of deities to human-beings directly.^1

गणपतिनाग
2. Gan2apatina1ga (No. 1, L. 21): Another king of A1ryya1vartta defeated by Samudragupta. The first part is Gan2apati and the second is ‘na1ga’, which signifies that the king belonged to the Na1ga dynasty. He probably ruled at Mathura1.^2 Names based on Moon

चन्द्रवर्म्मन्
1. Candravarmman: (No. 1, L. 21): One of the kings of A1ryya1vartta defeated by Samudragupta. The first part is Candra and second is ‘Varmma’ which is a form for the original term ‘varman’, a surname generally used for ks2atriyas. He may be identified with the king of that name whose record has been found at Susunia in Bankura district, Bengal.^3

सुरश्मिचन्द्र
2. Suras4micandra (No. 18, L. 4): He is described as the ruler of the country that lies between the rivers Ka1lindi1 and Narmada1, and governing with the qualities of a regent lording, one of the quarters of the world, and enjoying the title of a maha1ra1ja during the reign of Budhagupta.  Literally it means ‘a moon possessed of good rays’. Names based on Na1ga

नागदत्त
1. Na1gadatta (No. 1, L. 21): One of the kings of A1ryya1vartta defeated by Samudragupta. The first part is Na1ga which refers most likely to ‘a holy serpent’ and the second is ‘datta’ meaning given. Thus the full name may mean ‘born by the grace of a Na1ga’. D.C. Sircar takes the compound as a Caturthi1 Tatpurus2a instance meaning ‘dedicated to a Na1ga’. However, the compounds are usually taken as Tr2ti1ya1 Tatpurus2a instances. The names do not indicate towards bali but such names as Gurudatta, S4ivadatta and Na1gadatta may exhibit reverence to Guru, S4iva or Na1ga by whose worship or blessings the son was born which is attested to by tradition of such names.

नागसेन
2. Na1gasena (No. 1, L. 13, 21): The first part of the name is Na1ga and the second is sena. Na1gasena of the L. 13 and L. 21 looks to be the same.^4 According to L. 21 he was one of the kings of A1ryya1vartta uprooted by Samudragupta. In L. 13 he is mentioned as having been defeated by Samudragupta by the valour of his arms. He seems to have been an important king.^5 Names based on S4iva

रुद्रदत्त
1. Rudradatta (No. 52, L. 3): He is given the designation of a maha1ra1ja and is mentioned as a pa1dada1sa (slave of the feet) of Vainyagupta. The first part literally meaning roaring, dreadful or terrible^6 denotes S4iva and the second ‘given’; the full name meaning ‘given by Lord S4iva’.

रुद्रदेव
2. Rudradeva (No. 1, L. 21): He is described as one of the kings of A1ryya1vartta defeated by Samudragupta. The first part of the name is Rudra which denotes Lord S4iva and the second is ‘deva’ which means ‘god’. It is another name based on Lord S4iva. Rudradeva has been differently identified by various scholars. Dr. D.C. Sircar has identified him with the Western Satrap Rudrasena II or his son Rudrasena III, while K.P. Jayaswal, K.N. Dikshit and R.N. Dandekar identify him with Va1ka1t2aka Rudrasena I. U.N. Roy^7 differing with the above scholars proposes his  identification with Va1ka1t2aka Maha1ra1ja Rudrasena II, the son of Pr2thvis2en2a I.

उग्रसेन
3. Ugrasena (No. 1, L. 20): He is mentioned as a ruler of Pa1lakka during the reign of Samudragupta. Ugra meaning ‘powerful mighty or terrible’, is another name of Rudra or S4iva.^8 Sena is merely a surname. Or we can give another explanation of the whole as Ugra1 sena1 asya, i.e. ‘having mighty army’. Names based on Sun We find only one such name which is as given below: --

प्रभाकर
1. Prabha1kara (No. 32, L. 8): He is described as a king (bhu1mipati) and a destroyer of the enemies of the Gupta dynasty. He was the overlord of Dattabhat2a. He is not known from any other source. The name of his capital or territory is not mentioned. Probably he was the contemporary local chief of Das4apura and a feudatory ally of the Guptas in their struggle against the Hu1n2as.^9 Dattabhat2a does not include in the inscription the genealogy of his master. It is possible that Prabha1kara was a self-made man who did not have a distinguished ancestor worthy of record. He may have been appointed as a ruler of Das4apura by the paramount power, after the extinction of the Varman dynasty.^10 That Prabha1kara was not a scion of the Varman dynasty would also appear from his name which, unlike the names of the known members of that dynasty, does not end in Varman.^11 The name violates the laws of Gr2hyasu1tras which forbid the direct imposition of the names of deities upon human-beings. Names based on Vis2n2u

अच्युतनन्दिन्
1. Acyutanandin (No. 1, L. 21): He is included in the list of kings of A1ryya1vartta forcefully uprooted by Samudragupta. Acyuta is the name of Vis2n2u or Kr2s2n2a,^12 and Nandin is the name of an attendant of S4iva and also the name of S4iva's bull.^13 So literally the expression would mean ‘one who is a servant of god Visn2u’. Nandin also means gladdening or rejoicing.^14 So it may also mean ‘one who pleases or wins over god Vis2n2u’. Acyutanandin seems to have been a ruler of Ahicchatra  (near Bareilly district).^15 The Pura1n2as give names ending in ‘Nandin’ in the list of Na1ga kings and coins bearing ‘Acyuta’ have been found from Ahicchatra.^16 Therefore, it is possible that Ahicchatra was a seat of government of Acyutanandin.

धन्यविष्णु
2. Dhanyavis2n2u (No. 18, L. 8): He was the grandson of maha1ra1ja Indravis2n2u and younger brother of maha1ra1ja Ma1tr2vis2n2u. We also find his name in line 5 of the Eran2 Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Torama1n2a (A.D. 500-515).^17 It signifies the tendency of naming persons by using adjectives before the names of deities. Dhanya means ‘bringing or bestowing wealth or the opulent’.^18

हरिविष्णु
3. Harivis2n2u (No. 18, L. 6): He was the great-grandfather of maha1ra1ja Ma1tr2vis2n2u. Hari here specifies the Kr2s2n2a apparition of Vis2n2u.^19

इन्द्रविष्णु
4. Indravis2n2u (No. 18, L. 5): He has been mentioned as a maha1ra1ja, great-grand-father of Ma1tr2vis2n2u; a bra1hman2a devoted to studies and celebrating sacrifices and belonging to Maitra1yan2i1ya (s4a1kha1). The vedic counterpart is Indra1vis2n2u1 m. dual.

मतृविष्णु
5. Matr2vis2n2u: (No. 18, L. 7): He was the installer of the stone pillar at Eran2, a maha1ra1ja, grandson of maha1ra1ja Indravis2n2u. We also find his name in the Eran2 Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Torama1n2a (A.D. 500-515).^20 Ma1tr2 stands for one of the seven Ma1tr2ka1s^21 and may refer to the prevalence of the Ma1tr2 cult. The name is formed by the similar process of the combination of the names of two deities, Ma1tr2 and Vis2n2u. Ma1tr2 if taken as a short form for the Vedic Ma1taris4van, together with Vis2n2u would mean Agni and Vis2n2u an interpretation that is relevant to the context.

वरुणविष्णु
6. Varun2avis2n2u (No. 18, L. 5): He was the grandfather of maha1ra1ja Ma1tr2vis2n2u. The name is based on the combination of the names of two deities Varun2a and Vis2n2u. Varun2a is the sea-god of the Vedic pantheon.

विष्णुदास
7. Vis2n2uda1sa (No. 3, L. 2): Maha1ra1ja Vis2n2uda1sa belonged to the Sanaka1ni1ka family. Vis2n2u signifies the Lord Vis2n2u and da1sa means ‘a servant’. Thus the whole literally means ‘a servant or devotee of Lord Vis2n2u’. 

विष्णुगोप
8. Vis2n2ugopa (No 1, L. 19): A ruler of Ka1n5ci1. According to Diskalkar Vis2n2ugopa is undoubtedly identical with an early Pallava king of that name.^22 It can be a synonym of Lord Kr2s2n2a who originally an incarnation of Vis2n2u took his birth as the son of Nanda who was a Gopa. Now we study the names grouping them according to their suffixes. Names ending in ‘datta’

पर्णदत्त
1. Parn2adatta (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9): He is mentioned as a ruler of Sura1s2t2ra appointed by Skandagupta. He was the father of governor Cakrapa1lita. Sankalia considers it to be an Iranian name.^23 But it can can very well be an Indian name. Parn2a means a leaf and is as well the name of a tree called Pala1s4a. We find ‘Parn2adatta’ to be the name of a man in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam3hita1.^24 It signifies ‘a person born as a result of the worship of the Parn2a (Pala1s4a) tree’.

स्वामिदत्त
2. Sva1midatta^25 (No. 1, L. 19): He is mentioned as one of the Daks2in2a1patha kings. He was a ruler of Kot2t2u1ra and was defeated by Samudragupta. Literally the name means ‘given by God’, the first part being Sva1min and the second datta'. Names ending in ‘Giri’

महेन्द्रगिरि
1. Mahendragiri^26 (No. 1, L. 19): The first part is Mahendra, i.e., the great Indra and the second is ‘giri’, which means a mountain. It is also an honorific name later on given to one of the ten orders of the Das-nami Gosains (founded by ten pupils of S4an3kara1ca1rya; the word giri is added to the name of each member).^27 We also find it used with the names of ascetics. He was one of the Daks2in2a1ptha kings defeated by Samudragupta. Names ending in Mitra

पुष्यमित्र
Pus2yamitra (No. 13, L. 11,): The name is mentioned in plural.^28 It is said that Pus2yamitras  who had developed great power and wealth were defeated by king Skandagupta. The other readings suggested by scholars are Pus2pamitra and Yudhyamitra. But a careful scrutiny will support the reading Pus2yamitra as more likely. In the passages quoted by Bu7hler from the Prakrit Ga1tha1s, ascribed to Merutun3ga, Dharmasa1gara and Jayavijaya1gni^29, the name of the early king Pus2yamitra, the contemporary of Patan5jali appears as Pusamitta and thus supports the reading Pus2yamitra. Pus2yamitra in plural may denote the followers of king Pus2yamitra. Pus2yamitra, the name of a tribe in Central India, is also mentioned in the Pura1n2as. Names ending in Ra1jan(Ra1ja)

देवराज
1. Devara1ja (No. 5, L. 7): Fleet fills up the lacuna^30 and takes Devara1ja to be the name of an officer of Candragupta II.^31 But D.C. Sircar takes it as another name of Candragupta II.^32 The view of Sircar is more plausible and has been generally accepted by scholars.^33 It may, however, be noted that in Va1ka1t2aka grants Devagupta is mentioned as another name of a Candragupta II.^34 Literally the name means ‘a king of gods’ which is also another name of Indra.

गोपराज
2. Gopara1ja (No. 19, LL. 3, 5): A feudatory cheif who is said to have accompanied the mighty king glorious Bha1nugupta and fought a famous battle. Gopara1ja died in the battle and his wife burnt herself on the funeral pyre along with him. The inscription informs us that he was the son of a king named Ma1dhava, and was the daughter's son of the S4arabha king, belonging to the lineage of Laks2a of which he is described as an ornament. Literally the name means ‘a king of the Gopas’, i.e., milkmen or Ahi1ras. Ra1ja is a surname signifying ‘the king’.

मण्टराज
3. Man2t2ara1ja (No. 1, L. 19): King of Kuru1l2a, one of the rulers of Daks2n2a1patha defeated by Samudragupta. In this name the first part is Man2t2a and the second is Ra1ja. The meaning of the first part is not clear. It is clearly not a  Sanskrit word. As Woolner has pointed out words with cerebrals are often non-A1ryan or influenced by non-A1ryan elements.^35 Another possibility is that these names show dialectal elements. Even now-a-days we give names like Man2t2u, Ban2t2u, etc., to little children. There is also a possibility that the Sanskrit word ‘mantra’ meaning ‘a hymn or magical formula’ got changed to ‘man2t2a’ through a process of Prakritization, or we may derive it from an artificial root ‘man2t2’ to act as intermediator.^36

नीलराज
4. Ni1lara1ja (No. 1, LL. 19-20): A king of Avamukta, one of the Daks2in2a1patha kings defeated by Samudragupta. The first part of the name is Ni1la and the second is ra1ja. Ni1la means ‘of dark colour’ especially blue or green or black^37 and is also the name of a Na1ga and ra1ja is the surname added to it.

शर्भराज
5. S4arbhara1ja (No. 19, L. 4): He was the maternal grandfather of Gopara1ja, the feudatory chief of king Bha1nugupta. S4arabha is the name of a people and also refers to a fabulous animal supposed to have eight legs and to inhabit the snowy mountains; it is represented as stronger than the lion and the elephant.^38 The name may literally mean ‘a king of the S4arabha people’. It may also be treated as a name based on an animal.

व्याघ्रराज
6. Vya1ghrara1ja (No. 1, L. 19): He was the ruler of Maha1ka1nta1ra and was one of the kings of Daks2in2a1patha defeated by Samudragupta. He has been identified with the Va1ka1t2aka feudatory prince Vya1ghra whose inscriptions have been found at Nach-ne-ki-talai and Ganj in Central India, who is also said to have been the ruler of the Ucchakalpa dynasty in Bundelkhand.^39 But an objection to this view is that he must be a ruler in Daks2in2a1patha as mentioned in our inscription and has accordingly been identified with the ruler of Maha1-vana, a synonym of Maha1-ka1nta1ra, also called Jeypore forest in Orissa.^40 The name is based on the animal Vya1ghra, or tiger implying that in Maha1ka1nta1ra his subordinate chiefs were like tigers and he was their ruler. The name is a good selection in the  context of the fact that the region of Maha1ka1nta1ra is known to have been infested with tigers.

राज
7...ra1ja (No. 19, L. 3): The first part of the name has been damaged. He was a king and was the grandfather of Gopara1ja, the feudatory chief of king Bha1nugupta. He was the founder of the Laks2a lineage. Names ending in Varman

बलवर्म्मन्
1. Balavarmman (No. 1, L. 21): One of the kings of A1ryya1vartta said to have been forcefully uprotted by Samudragupta. The first part of the name is Bala which means strength or power and the second part Varmman is a surname used for ks2atriyas. The name may literally mean ‘one who protects with his power’. It is a name based on quality.

बन्धुवर्म्मन्
2. Bandhuvarmman (No. 17, L. 15, L. 16): Bandhuvarmman was the son of Vis4vavarman. He was probably a feudatory chief, ruling at Dasapura, Mandasor in Western Malwa,^41 in the time of Kuma1ragupta I. He has been mentioned as a king (nr2pa) governing the city of Das4apura and it was under his rulership that the Sun-temple was caused to be built by the guild of silk-cloth weavers at Mandasor (Das4apura). The relevant lines in the inscription lay a stress on his name Bandhu. He is described as possessed of firmness and statesmanship; beloved of (his) kinsmen; the relative, as it were, of (his) subjects; the remover of the afflictions of (his) connections; pre-eminently skilful in destroying the ranks of (his) proud enemies.^42 Varman is a ks2atriya surname meaning ‘the protector’, the entire expression may literally be translated as ‘the protector of his relatives’.

भीमवर्मन्
3. Bhi1mavarman (No. 26, L. 1): He is mentioned as a maha1ra1ja and seems to have been a feudatory king of Skandagupta. Bhi1ma was the name of one of the five Pa1n2d2avas (the second son of Pa1n2d2u) mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata. Literally the name may mean ‘one who protects by awfulness’. Bhi1ma is also the name of Rudra-S4iva, one of the eight forms of S4iva.^43 Thus it may be a name based on god S4iva.

हस्तिवर्म्मन्
4. Hastivarmman (No. 1, L. 2):  A king of Ven3gi1 in the time of Samudragupta and included in the list of the Daks2in2a1patha kings defeated by the latter. He is identical with the king of the Sa1lan3ka1yana dynasty whose record has been found at Peddavegi.^44 It is a name based on animal. The name Hastin (elephant) denotes fatness and valour.

विश्ववर्म्मन्
5. Vis4vavarmman (No. 17, L. 14): A ruler (Goptr2) in the time of Kuma1ragupta I. Literally the name may mean ‘a protector of the world’. There is a second possibility that it is a name based on the deity Vis2n2u, because Vis4va meaning all-pervading or all-containing, omnipresent,^45 is also the name of Vis2n2u-kr2s2n2a. One-word names

अच्युत
1. Acyuta (No. 1, L. 13): It is the same as Acyutanandin mentioned in line 21.^46 It is the abbreviated form of the full name Acyutanandin where the latter part is dropped. The abridged form ‘Acyuta’ leads to the violation of the injunctions of the Dharma-su1tras which forbid giving direct names of gods to human-beings. Acyuta is the name of god Vis2n2u or Kr2s2n2a.^47

छगलग
2. Chagalaga (No. 3, L. 2): A maha1ra1ja, grandfather of a maha1ra1ja whose name in line 2 is illegible and who belonged to the Sanaka1ni1ka tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candragupta II. We find the word Chagala literally meaning ‘a hegoat’^48 in the Un2a1di-su1tras of Pa1n2ini where it is the name of a R2s2i.^49 It seems to be a nonA1ryan word. The words Chagala, Chagalaka or Chagalaga mean the same.^50

दमन
3. Damana (No. 1, L. 19): A ruler of Eran2d2apalla who was one of the Daks2in2a1patha kings conquered by Samudragupta. We get this name in the Maha1bha1rata and the Pura1n2as. Literally the word daman means ‘taming, subduing, overpowering’;^51 hence the name may mean ‘one who subdues or overpowers others’.

धनञ्जय
4. Dhanan5jaya (No. 1, L. 20): A ruler of Kusthalapura and one of the Daks2in2a1patha kings defeated by Samudragupta. The name has some connection with the Epic. In the Maha1bha1rata Dhanan5jaya is one of the  epithets of Arjuna Literally it would mean, ‘one who wins a prize or booty or acquires wealth’.

कुबेर
5. Kubera (No. 1, L. 20): Ruler of Devara1s2t2ra mentioned in the list of the kings of Daks2in2a1patha who were defeated by Samudragupta. According to Bhandarkar Kubera was perhaps the father of Kubera-na1ga1 of the Na1ga family, who was a queen of Candragupta II.^52 In this case the name of Kubera, the god of wealth, has been given directly which is against the rules prescribed by the Gr2hya-su1tras.^53

माधव
6. Ma1dhava (No. 19, L. 3): Father of Gopara1ja, the feudatory of Bha1nugupta; born of Laks2a lineage. It is the name of Lord Kr2s2n2a given to this king which violates the rules of Dharmasu1tras.

मतिल
7. Matila (No. 1, L. 21): One of the kings of A1ryya1vartta defeated by Samudragupta. According to Pa1n2ini,^54 a polysyllabic name was sometime shortened in order to express affection. Thus in the case of names ending in ‘ila’ we find Devila being derived from Devadatta; Yajn5ila and Yajn5adatta; Makhila from Makhadeva; Agila from Agnidatta; Satila from Sva1tidatta; Na1gila from Na1gadatta, and Yasila, Yakhila from Yaks2adatta.^55 Similarly Matila can be formed from Matideva or Matidatta. NAMES OF MINISTERS

आम्रकार्द्दव
1. A1mraka1rddava (No. 5, L. 5): Hailing from Sukuli-des4a who loyally served Candragupta II by fighting and winning many battles for him. The first part of the name is based on the mango tree. The second part is ka1rddava.^56 It is the name of some Na1gas or serpent-demons thought to be inhabitants of the lower regions.^57 Kadru is the name of the mother of serpents. Ka1drava by metathesis becomes Ka1rddava which literally means ‘born of Kadru’. In south, among aboriginal people and lower castes, the practice of matriarchal names is well known. The whole term ‘A1mraka1rddava’ is inexplicable as one word. A1mra seems to be his personal name and Ka1rddava his family title. 

हरिषेण
2. Haris2en2a (No. 1, L. 32): He is given several titles indicating offices held of a Kha1dyat2apa1kika,^58 a Sa1ndhivigrahika, a Kuma1ra1ma1tya and a Maha1dan2d2ana1yaka of Samudragupta. He is also the composer of this inscription which has been termed as a ka1vya.^59 Hari is Vis2n2u or Kr2s2n2a and sena is to be obtained from Sanskrit sena1. The name can be explained in two ways. That Hari is his personal name and s2en2a or sena his surname. We may also explain it is, ‘one with Hari as his army’. The Maha1bha1rata informs us that there was only big army on the side of the Kauarvas and there was only Hari, i.e., Lord Kr2s2n2a on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas. The Pa1n2d2avas could get Hari on their side by foregoing the Ya1dava army to the Kauravas.

वीरसेन
3. Vi1rasena (No. 6, L. 4): Hailing from Pa1t2aliputra he was Candragupta II's minister for peace and war by hereditary right^60 and accompanied the king on his far-reaching military expeditions. The first part is Vi1ra which means ‘brave’ and the second is ‘sena’, the whole literally meaning ‘one with a brave army’. Pa1n2ini refers to Sena1nta names in his As2t2a1dhya1yi1.^61 We find many such names as Va1risena, R2s2t2is2en2a, Bhi1masena and Ugrasena.^62 U.N. Roy conjectures the possibility of the composition of the ‘Pras4asti’ inscribed on the Meharauli Iron Pillar Inscription by S4a1ba alias Vi1rasena who was an accomplished poet and a favourite minister of Candragupta II, Vikrama1ditya.^63 It is possible that he outlived his patron and when during a Dharmaya1tra1 he revisited the spot where the lofty banner had been raised as a mark of homage to Lord Vis2n2u after the victory over the Va1hlikas, was moved to compose and inscribe this Pras4asti on the Meharauli Pillar.^64 Names of Commanders

दत्तभट
1. Dattabhat2a (No. 32, L. 7): A son of Va1yuraks2ita, himself also a general of the armies of king Prabha1kara (appointed by him). We find here the word ‘datta’ used as the first part of the name. The second part is ‘bhat2a’ which means a ‘warrior’.

ध्रुवभूति
2. Dhruvabhu1ti (No. 1, L. 32): He was a maha1dan2d2ana1yaka and is mentioned in the  Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta. The first part is dhruva which means ‘firm’ or definite and the second part is bhu1ti which means ‘wealth or prosperity’, a surname generally used for Vais4yas. Literally it would mean ‘whose prosperity is enduring’.

गोपस्वामिन्
3. Gopasva1min (No. 40, L. 11; No. 21, L. 15): In No. 40, he has been mentioned as aks2apa1t2ala1dhikr2ta, maha1pi1lupati and maha1bala1dhikr2ta. The Gaya1 spurious copper plate inscription of Samudragupta (No. 21) was written by the order of Dyu1ta-gopasva1min, aks2apat2ala1dhikr2ta of another village. Literally-Gopasva1min means ‘Lord of herdsmen’ which is a popular expression for Lord Kr2s2n2a.

हरिषेण
4. Haris2en2a (No. 1, L. 32): He has been mentioned as a maha1dan2d2ana1yaka in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta. His name has already been explained among the names of ministers.

तिलभट्टक
5. Tilabhat2t2aka^65 (No. 1, L. 33): He was a maha1dan2d2ana1yaka and is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta. We find personal names with their first part as ‘Tilaka’ but never as ‘Tila’.^66 In the present case also the first part of the name was probably ‘Tilaka’ and the second was bhat2t2a. Later on by the process of metathesis the name may have become ‘Tilabhat2t2aka’. Tilaka is a mark on the forehead (made with coloured earths, sandal-wood, or unguents, either as an ornament of a sectarial distinction),^67 the second part ‘bhat2t2a’ is a surname.

वायुरक्षित
6. Va1yuraks2ita^68 (No. 32, L. 5): He was a commander of the army (sena1pati). The first part of the name is Va1yu standing for ‘the god of the wind’,^69 and the second part is ‘raks2ita’ which means ‘protected’. The full name literally means ‘protected by the god of the wind’. Names of Governors

ब्रह्मदत्त
1. Brahmadatta (No. 33, L. 2): An Uparika-maha1ra1ja ruling over the Pun2d2ravardhana-bhukti in the reign of Budhagupta. The name would literally mean, ‘given by (the grace of) God’.

चक्रपालित
2. Cakrapa1lita (No. 14, L. 11, L. 27):  Governor of Sura1s2t2ra in the reign of Skandagupta who restored the break in the Sudars4ana lake and renewed the embankment. It has been shown by Charpentier that he was an Iranian.^70 We find many Iranians adopting names after Hindu gods.^71 Cakrapa1lita means ‘one protected by the disc (bearer)’, i.e., a devotee of Vis2n2u, a name adopted after this person became a Vais2n2ava (Hindu).^72

चिरातदत्त
3. Cira1tadatta (No. 34, L. 2, L. 3): The first part Cira1ta can be a Prakritization of the word Kira1ta which is the name of S4iva (the god S4iva in the form of a wild mountaineer or Kira1ta as opposed to Arjuna).^73 Hence the complete expression would literally mean ‘begotton by the grace of Kira1ta’.

जयदत्त
4. Jayadatta (No. 33, L. 3): It is the name of an Uparika-maha1ra1ja in the reign of Budhagupta. Jaya is the name of Arjuna (son of Pa1n2d2u).^74 The second part ‘datta’ is a surname. It may thus be a name based on the Epic. It may also be noted that Jayadatta was the name of a Bodhisattva.^75

विजयसेन
5. Vijayasena (No. 52, L. 16): He was a du1taka, maha1pratiha1ra, a maha1pi1lupati, an uparika of five adhikaran2as, an upari1ka over a pati1, an uparika over a purapa1la, a maha1ra1ja and S4ri1 maha1sa1manta during the reign of Vainyagupta. The name can literally mean ‘one whose army always wins’. Names of Kuma1ra1ma1tyas^76

कुलवृद्धि
1. Kulavr2ddhi (No. 44, L. 1): One of the Kuma1ra1ma1tyas in the time of Kuma1ragupta I. This is a very good name which literally means ‘one who increases the family’. A son is always considered to continue the genealogical sequence and hence to increase the family.

पृथिवीषेण
2. Pr2thivi1s2en2a^77 (No. 39, L. 7): The son of S4ikharasva1min, the minister, and the kuma1ra1ma1tya maha1bala1dhikr2ta of Candragupta II. He himself was the minister, the kuma1ra1ma1tya and maha1bala1dhikr2ta of Kuma1ragupta I. His grandfather was Vis2n2upa1litabhat2t2a,^78 the son of Kurama1ravyabhat2t2a^79 of the gotras As4va and Va1jin and who was a teacher of Chandoga (Veda). 

रेवज्जस्वामिन्
3. Revajjasva1min (No. 52, L. 17): A kuma1ra1ma1tya in the time of Vainyagupta. The first part is Revajja and the second sva1min. Revajja can be derived from revat which means rich or prosperous.^80 Thus the name would literally mean ‘master of the rich’.

शिखरस्वामिन्
4. S4ikharasva1min (No. 39, L. 6): He was the minister and the kuma1ra1ma1tya of maha1ra1ja1dhira1ja, illustrious Candragupta II and was the son of Vis2n2upa1litabhat2t2a, the son of Kurama1ravyabhat2t2a, a teacher of the Chandoga (Veda). S4ikhara means a peak or summit of a mountain, hence the whole may literally mean ‘one who is a master of s4ikhara’. The name seems to represent Lord S4iva due to S4iva's connection with the Himalayas.

वेत्रवर्मन्
5. Vetravarman (No. 34, L. 4; No. 35, LL. 3-4): A kuma1ra1ma1tya in the time of Kuma1ragupta I. Vetra means the rod or mace of an officer, or staff of a door-keeper.^81 So the whole will literally mean ‘one who protects by means of a vetra’. Names of A1yuktakas (Commissioners or District collectors)

अच्युतदास
1. Acyutada1sa (No. 43. L. 1): Acyuta is the name of Lord Vis2n2u. So the present name would literally mean ‘a da1sa or servant of Vis2n2u’. According to the smr2tis the surname da1sa should be used for s4u1dras.^82

भामह
2. Bha1maha (No. 52, L. 17): He has been mentioned as a bhogika in this inscription. It was also the name of the author of the Alam3ka1ra-s4a1stra and of the Pra1krita-manorama1 (commentary on the Pra1krita-praka1s4a)^83 Literally the name may mean ‘one possessing great light, splendour or brightness’.

चन्द्रगुप्त
3. Candragupta (No. 40, L. 12): He is mentioned as a kuma1ra.^84 This name has already been explained among the names of the Gupta kings.

देवभट्टारक
4. Devabhat2t2a1raka (No. 37, L. 3): He is mentioned to have ruled over the vis2aya of Kot2ivars2a. The name is based on the name of Lord Sun. Devabhat2t2a1raka seems to be a metathesis of Bhat2t2a1rakadeva which means ‘The god Bhat2t2a1raka’. 

शण्डक
5. S4a (ga) n2d2aka (No. 36, L. 3): D.C. Sircar takes the reading to be Gan2d2aka which seems to be correct.^85 One scholar^86 equates S4an2d2aka with San2d2aka which means a ‘bull’ and says that the word Gan2d2aka yields no sensible meaning. But Gan2d2aka has been accepted as the most probable reading by scholars.^87 Gan2d2aka is the name of a river in the northern part of India.^88 So the name Gan2d2aka based on the river Gan2d2aki1 can be given to a person just as the name Gan3ga1 based on the river Ganges is given to a person. Gan2d2aka is also the name of the Videhas living on the river Gan2d2aki1^89 and also refers to a rhinoceros.^90 It is possible that the present name, like Vya1ghra discussed elsewhere is based on the name of an animal.

शर्व्वनाग
6. S4arvvana1ga (No. 16, LL. 4-5): He was a vis2ayapati in the reign of Skan2dagupta. S4arvva is the name of Lord S4iva^91 and na1ga may be a surname indicating that the person belonged to the Na1ga tribe.

स्वयम्भुदेव
7. Svayambhu (u1) deva (No. 37, L. 4): He has been mentioned as a Vis2ayapati in the Damodarpur copper plate inscription of Bha1nugupta. Literally the name would mean ‘self-existent god’, i.e., Brahma1. As meantioned earlier the practice of giving names of gods to human-beings directly is against the tradition of the Dharmasu1tras.

च्छन्दक
1. Ccha(cha)ndaka (No. 46, L. 12): He is mentioned as the youngest son of a certain Hari-s4res2t2hin. Chandaka means ‘charming’. It was the name of Gautama Buddha's charioteer.^1

The first part of the name is based on the virtue ‘Dhr2ti’ (which mean firmness, resolution or command).^2 The second part is Pa1la which means a guard, protector or keeper.^3 The complete expression means ‘an observer of firmness’.

हरिश्रेष्ठिन्
3. Hari-s4res2t2hin (No. 46, L. 11): He was the son of Kaivarttis4res2t2hin. While he and his father are called s4res2t2hins, none of his sons is called s4res2t2hin or banker by profession. Hari is the name of god Vis2n2u or Kr2s2n2a:

कैवर्त्तिश्रेष्ठिन्
4. Kaivartti-s4res2t2hin (No. 46, L. 11): Kaivarta is a fisherman (born of prostitute by ks2atriya or of an Ayogava female by a Nis2a1da father).^4 We may infer that his mother was from the family of a fisherman and father belonged to a S4res2t2hin class.

रिभुपाल
5. Ribhupa1la (No. 36, LL. 3-4; L. 5, L. 14; No. 37, L. 4): The orthographic change in the first letter is to be noted.^5 Ribhu here may mean property or wealth.^6 The whole may thus mean, ‘a protector of property or wealth’. In No. 36 Ribhupa1la has been mentioned as nagara-s4res2t2hin. In No. 37 he is also described as A1ryya.

श्रीदत्त
6. S4ri1datta (No. 46, LL. 11-22): He was the eldest son of Hari-s4res2t2hin and the grandson of Kaivartti-s4res2t2hin. S4ri1 is the goddess of wealth and datta means given. The whole expression will mean, ‘born by the grace of  the goddess of wealth’.

वर्ग्ग
7. Vargga, Vargga-gra1mika (No. 46, L. 12, L. 15): He was the middle son of Hari-s4res2t2hin. In L. 12 he is mentioned only as Vargga and in L. 15 as Vargga-gra1mika. While his father is called a s4res2t2hin he was not s4res2t2hin or banker by profession. The word gra1mika affixed to Vargga's name suggests that he was the headman of a village which seems to be no other than Avad2a1ra. Vargga literally means one who excludes or removes or averts’.^7 NAMES OF PRATHAMA KULIKAS (Chief Artisans)

धृतिमित्र
1. Dhr2timitra (No. 34, L. 5; No. 35, L. 5): It is a name based on virtue, the first part being Dhr2ti ‘perseverance’ and the second'part ‘mitra’ friend, the whole meaning ‘one who is friendly to perseverance’, i.e., a man full of perseverance. Names ending in mitra^8 are very few in the Vedic literature but seem to have been very popular in the post-Pa1n2inian period. Coins^9 as well as the epigraphic records show an abundant use of mitra- ending names.^10

मतिदत्त
2. Matidatta (No. 37, L. 5): It is also a name based on virtue, the first part being ‘mati’ intellect and the second ‘datta’, the whole meaning, ‘begotton by virtue of intellect’.

वरदत्त
3. Varadatta (No. 36, L. 4): The first part is Vara meaning boon and the second is datta, the whole meaning ‘begotton by a boon’. Names ending in datta were very popular in the time of Patan5jali and figure much in ancient Pali works.^11 It is a vais4ya name-ending. NAMES OF KULIKAS (Artisans) We get only one name of a kulika which occurs four times in an inscription.

भीम
Bhi1ma (No. 43, LL. 3; 17, 19, 25): It is a name based on the Epic tradition. Bhi1ma was the name of one of the five Pa1n2d2avas in the Maha1bha1rata and literally means ‘dreadful’. NAMES OF PRATHAMA KA1YASTHAS (Chief Scribes)

शाम्बपाल
1. S4a1mbapa1la (No. 34, LL. 5-6; No. 35, L. 5):  The first part of the name S4a1mba is to be derived from Sa1mba which literally means accompanied by Amba1 (Durga1) and is the name of Lord S4iva.^12 It has been the name of a son of Kr2s2n2a and Ja1mbavati1 as well as of several authors and teachers.^13 Pa1la is a name-ending suffix having the least significance in the present case. Perhaps it has been added only to honour the Gr2hyasu1tra injunction of not giving names of deities directly to human-beings.^14

स्कन्दपाल
2. Skandapa1la (No. 37, L. 5): Skanda is the name of Ka1rttikeya. Pa1la here is a mere nameending suffix which has the same significance as in the case of S4a1mbapa1ta discussed above.

विप्रपाल
3. Viprapa1la (No. 36, L. 4): The first part is vipra which means a bra1hman2a and the second part is ‘pa1la’ which means ‘protector’. the whole thus meaning ‘one who protects the bra1hman2as’. We do not get pa1la nameending in the Pa1n2inian period. It is a ks2atriya name-ending. NAMES OF KA1YASTHAS (Scribes)

देवदत्त
1. Devadatta (No. 43, L. 3): The first part of the name is deva and the second is datta, the whole meaning ‘given by the gods’. This name was very popular in the time of Patan5jali.^15

लक्ष्मण
3. Laks2man2a (No. 43, L. 3): It is a name based on the Epic tradition. Laks2man2a was the younger brother of Ra1ma and his name literally means ‘endowed with auspicious signs or marks, lucky, fortunate’.^16

नरदत्त
4. Naradatta (No. 52, L. 18): The first part is Nara which here means the primeval man or eternal spirit pervading the universe, i.e., Purus2a (always associated with Na1ra1yan2a ‘son of the primeval man’). Both Nara and Na1ra1yan2a are considered as gods or sages and accordingly called devau, r2s2i1, tapasau.^17 The second part is datta, the whole meaning ‘given by the eternal spirit pervading the universe’. He seems to have been a scribe belonging to the office of the  minister for peace and war.^18

प्रभुचन्द्र
5. Prabhucandra (No. 43, L. 3, L. 25): The first part is Prabhu which is one of the names of Lord S4iva in the Maha1bha1rata.^19 The second is candra, the whole meaning ‘a moon, (on the forehead) of S4iva.^20

1. Bhat2anandin (No. 37, L. 11): The first part is Bhat2a and the second is nandin. Bhat2a here is the name of a serpent-demon.^21 The whole means ‘one who is an attendant of Bhat2a’. The other meaning of Bhat2a is scholar which is not applicable here.

दिवाकरनन्दिन्
2. Diva1karanandin (No. 28, L, 10): The first part is ‘Diva1kara’ (day-maker), which is another name of god Sun.^22 Nandin here is a name-ending suffix literally meaning ‘the happy one’ and is the name of Vis2n2u, S4iva and an attendant of S4iva. This name-ending was not known in the time of Pa1n2ini. According to Sankalia names directly after deities were probably after the family-god,^23 which in the present case seems to have been S4iva. It is possible that the first part of the name was connected with same deity and than the name of the family-deity was added as the name-ending surname. The word nandin is generally used to refer to ‘an attendant of S4iva’ or the va1hana ‘nandi1n’ bull of S4iva. So the name Diva1karnandin may literally mean ‘an attendant of god Sun’. The word Nandin also means ‘gladdening’.^24 So another interpretation can be ‘one who pleases or wins over Lord Sun’.

गोपदत्त
3. Gopadatta (No. 37, L. 11): The first part is Gopa and the second is datta. Gopa literally meaning cowherd is a synonym for Lord Kr2s2n2a.^25 So it would  mean ‘born by the grace of Lord Kr2s2n2a’. Names ending in datta are common in Buddhist literature.^26

4. Nara (na) ndin (No. 37, L. 10): The first part Nara here means the primeval or eternal spirit pervading the universe,^27 the second part is nandin; the whole meaning ‘one who is an attendant of Nara’. It may also mean ‘one who pleases or wins over Nara’ or the one pleasing (other) human-beings. NAMES OF PUSTAPA1LAS (Record-keepers) Names ending in Da1sa

अर्क्कदास
1. Arkkada1sa (No. 44, L. 10): Arkka is the name of god Sun^28 and da1sa means servant; the whole meaning ‘one who is a servant of god Sun’.

हरिदास
2. Harida1sa (No. 28, L. 10): The first part is Hari which means ‘god’. It is a name given to many gods,^29 but generally it is used for Vis2n2u or Kr2s2n2a. The second part is da1sa. The whole literally means ‘one who is an attendant of Hari’.

पत्रदास
3. Patrada1sa (No. 36, L. 6, L. 8): Patra means a letter or documents, and da1sa means ‘a servant’. Thus the whole may literally mean, ‘one who is a servant to letters or documents’ which is a very befitting name for a record-keeper.

रामदास
4. Ra1mada1sa (No. 28, L. 10): The first part is Ra1ma which refers to Lord Ra1ma of the Epic Ra1ma1yan2a and the second is da1sa, the whole meaning ‘a servant of Lord Ra1ma’. Names ending in Datta

रिशिदत्त
2. Ris4idatta^30 (No. 34, L. 10): Risidatta^31 (No. 35, L. 7): We get this word in above two forms but the first form is more accurate though not fully correct due to orthographic differences. The correct form should be ‘R2s2idatta’. The first part ‘R2s2i’ means ‘a sage’ and ‘datta’ means given, the whole  meaning ‘given by (the grace of) a sage’.

विभुदत्त
3. Vibhudatta (No. 34, L. 10; No. 35, L. 7): ‘Vibhu’ means all-pervading, and is applied to the names of several important gods, Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva, the Sun, Kubera and Indra^32 and ‘datta’ means ‘given’. The whole thus literally means ‘given by the all-pervading, i.e. God’.

विष्णुदत्त
4. Vis2n2udatta (No. 36, L. 9): The first part is Vis2n2u and the second datta, the whole thus literally meaning, ‘given by god Vis2n2u’. Names ending in Nandin

It may be noted that in Hindu religion the va1hana of a god is equally important and and is an object of worship.

स्थानुनन्दिन्
4. Stha1nunandin (No. 36, L. 10): The Sanskrit form of the first part Stha1nu is stha1n2u. It is the name of Lord S4iva (who is supposed to remain as motionless as the trunk of a tree during his austerities).^35 Nandin means ‘an attendant’. The whole thus literally means ‘one who is an attendant of Lord S4iva^36 or the one who pleases or wins over Lord S4iva.

विजयनन्दिन्
5. Vijayanandin (No. 36, L. 9): Vijaya is the name of god yama,^37 according to the lexicographical works, of a son of Jayanta (son of Indra), of a son of vasu-deva; of a son of Kr2s2n2a and of an attendant of Vis2n2u, and nandin means ‘an attendant’, or the one who pleases or  wins over lord Yama. This name has been very frequently used in ancient literature.^38 We are not sure to what god the name connotes the meaning. Miscellaneous

धृतिविष्णु
1. Dhr2tivis2n2u (No. 28, L. 10): The first part is Dhr2ti1 which means resolution or satisfaction. It is a name based on virtue. The second part Vis2n2u gives no meaning to the first part; it has only been added probably as the family deity.^39

विरोचन
2. Virocana (No. 28, L. 10): It is the name of the god Sun, literally meaning ‘illuminating’.^40 It is thus a case of the name of a god directly given to a man which is against the rules prescribed by the Smr2tis.

गण्ड
1. Gan2d2a (No. 43, L. 4): According to lexicographers Gan2d2a means ‘the chief; best, excellent’^43 and thus can signify a hero. The term is also used for the animal rhinoceros, so it can also be a case of a name based on the name of an animal. The custom of deriving names from animals was unknown in the Vedic pericd.^44 But in Pa1n2ini we find such references.^45

हरिसिंह
2. Harisim3ha (No. 43, L. 5): The first part is Hari which is the name alike of Vis2n2u, Kr2s2n2a, Moon, Va1yu (the god of the Wind) and according to lexicographers of S4iva.^46 The Second part ‘sim3ha’ has the purpose only of a surname and does not give any sensible meaning to the first part. In modern practice the word ‘sim3ha’ is used as a surname of ks2atriya, t2ha1kur and rajput castes.

ज्येष्ठदाम
3. Jyes2t2hada1ma (No. 43, LL. 4-5): The first part of the word is Jyes2t2ha literally meaning elder. Here it may stand for Jyes2t2ha Lin3ga described in the Lin3ga Pura1n2a.^47 The second part da1ma means ‘a garland’.^48 The whole thus literally means, ‘a garland of Jyes2t2ha Lin3ga’ and testifies  to the popularity of the Jyes2t2ha Lin3ga as an object of religious reverence.

देवकीर्त्ति
1. (De) vaki1rtti (No. 29, L. 4): The first part is ‘Deva’ which means ‘god’ and the second part is ki1rtti, meaning ‘fame’. The whole expression means ‘having fame like that of the gods’.

काल
5. Ka1la (No. 29, L. 4): Ka1la means time and as destroying all things, signifies death or time of death (often personified and represented with the attributes of Yama). Ka1la personified is also a Devars2i in Indra's-court, and is also the name of a son of Dhruva.^53

खासक
6. Kha1saka (No. 29, L. 5): It is an abbreviated name with the addition of suffix ‘ka’ which according to Pa1n2ini is used to denote: -(i) Depreciation.^54 (ii) Endearment.^55 It is a non-Sanskritic word most probably a local or dialectal feature. Here ‘ka’ suffix may have been used in the sense of endearment meaning a “poor khasa”: Khasa is the name of a people and of their country (in the north of India).^56 Kha1saka can be native of that country or a man belonging to that race (considered as a degraded ks2atriya).^57

क्षेमदत्त
7. Ks2emadatta (No. 29, L. 4): The first part is ks2ema which means ease, security or prosperity.^58 The second part is ‘datta’. Thus the whole literally means ‘given by prosperity’.

8. Pin3gala (No. 29, L. 4): It is a one-word name based on colour and means ‘reddishbrown’, ‘yellow’ or ‘gold-coloured’.^60

राम
9. Ra1ma (No. 29, L. 6): It is another one-word name. Here the name of Lord Ra1ma, the Epic hero, has been given directly to a person against the rules of the Smr2tis. We may suggest that in such cases either the second part is dropped or is not given at all by the parents.

रामक
10. Ra1maka (No. 29, L. 5): It is also an abbreviated name possibly from Ra1ma-datta (Cf. Pa1n2ini V. 3. 82) with the addition of the suffix ‘ka’. In the Agni Pura1n2a it is the name of Ra1ma Ra1ghava.^61 It is formed from  § ram and means delighting, gratifying.^62 According to lexicographers a Ra1maka is a Ma1gadha who lives as a messenger.^63 But here it is a personal name based on the Epic hero Lord Ra1ma.

श्रीभद्र

शुङ्कक
14. S4un3kaka (No. 29, L. 4): It is also an abbreviated name with the addition of suffix ‘ka’. The word should have been S4an3kuka instead of S4un3kaka. The present form may be due to the mistake of the engraver. The word S4un3kaka is meaningless. S4an3ku is the name of Lord S4iva. We have many names based on the word S4an3ku in literature. S4an3kuka was the name of a poet (author of the Bhuvana1bhyudaya and son of Mayu1ra),^66 and also of a writer on rhetoric.^67

श्रीभद्र
5. S4ri1bhadra (No. 29, L. 17): He engraved the Dhanaidaha Copper Plate Inscription of Kuma1ragupta 1. S4ri1bhadra is the name of a serpent-demon in the Buddhist literature.

Bhat2t2i is formed from ‘bhartr2’ meaning ‘lord’.^80 Miscellaneous

2. Ratibhadra (No. 43, L. 11): Rati is often personified as one of the two wives of Ka1madeva, together with Pri1ti.^2 Bhadra is the name of Lord S4iva.

कुमारभव
1. Kuma1rabhava (No. 43, L. 5): Kuma1ra is another name of Skanda or Ka1rttikeya^4 and Bhava is the name of Lord S4iva. So it is also a name formed by combining the names of two deities. We find several names with Kuma1ra as the first word. Cf. Kuma1rasva1min, Kuma1raha1ri1ta, Kuma1rabhat2t2a^5

Dharmas4a1stras prescribe ‘da1sa’ to be used by s4u1dras at the end of their names but we do not find any strict adherence to this rule by the society. Da1sa- ending names show devotion. We have such names as ‘Kulabhu1s2an2a’ based on the word ‘kula’.

मातृदास
2. Ma1tr2da1sa (No. 7, L. 4): Ma1tr2 means ‘mother’ or the divine mothers (considered to be 7, 9 or 16 in number).^7 So it will literally mean ‘a servant of the divine mothers’.

A child born in such lagna may be named as Sim3hadatta.^17 Names ending in Deva

Literally it means a bowl, pitcher, a vessel for coals, or a round hole in the ground (for receiving and preserving water or fire. Cf. Agnikun2d2a).^22 It is a Dravidian word.^23 We have the names of mohallas ending in ‘kun2d2a’, such as Durga1kun2d2a, Agastyakun2d2a, Laks2mi1kun2d2a in Va1ra1n2asi1. As a surname, we find its use for the Na1gara bra1hman2as.^24 We find many bra1hman2a surnames popular among the ka1yas thas of Bengal.^25 ‘Kun2d2a’ though originally a bra1hman2a surname is now a non-bra1hman2a surname in Bengal. Some of the people possessing the kun2d2a surname are found to be oil-men by profession. Its corrupt form kun2d2u is also found.

हिमशर्म्मन्
4. Himas4armman (No. 43, L. 9): Hima^39 means snow or winter. G. Bu7hler^40 takes the meaning of hima as ‘the moon’. So we can say that the name is based on the deity moon.

1. Guhavis2n2u (No. 43, L. 10; L. 11): Vis2n2u seems to have been the family deity of people listed here with Vis2n2u as the second part of their names. Guha is the name of Skanda or Ka1rttikeya. Vis2n2u signifies Lord Vis2n2u. So it is a name with the combination of two deities Guha and Vis2n2u.

यशोविष्णु
7. Yas4ovis2n2u (No. 43, L. 5):  Yas4as means fame or glory. The whole would literally mean “The god (Vis2n2u) of glory”.^56 One-word names In such names the second part is generally dropped for the sake of brevity. The names of the gods given directly to persons in some cases are against prescribed rules; but we may suggest that the second part has been dropped. 1.

लीढक
11. Li1d2haka (No. 43, L. 11): This name has also been formed by the addition of the suffix ‘ka’. The word is formed by the root ‘§ lih’ to lick, to eat or to taste.^73 Li1d2haka thus means ‘one who licks’. The name may have been given due to his habits of licking which exhibit greediness.

The whole will literally mean ‘the Moon of Lord S4iva,  situated on the forehead of Lord S4iva’. Names with Candra as their second part are quite common even now, e.g., S4ivacandra, Ra1macandra and Kr2s2n2acandra.

कुमारभूति
4. Kuma1rabhu1ti (No. 43, L. 5): Kuma1ra means Skanda or Ka1rttikeya and bhu1ti means power or wealth.^90 So the whole will mean ‘power or wealth of Kuma1ra’. We have also similar names like ‘Bhavabhu1ti’ meaning power or wealth of Lord S4iva.

Sircar takes the reading ‘Stha1yapa1la’.^99 He also suggests the possibility of a second reading ‘stha1napa1la’ which means ‘watchman or policeman’.^100 This reading seems to be correct; Stha1yapa1la yields no sensible meaning.

वसुमित्र
8. Vasumitra (No. 36, L. 4): The first part of the name is vasu (wealth) and the second is mitra the whole literally meaning ‘a friend of wealth’.

देवभट्ट
1. Devabhat2t2a (No. 43, LL. 14-15; L. 26): Deva, the first part of the name, means ‘god, heavenly or divine’. The second part is a name-ending suffix used for learned bra1hman2as. The ending Bhat2t2a denoting a scholar later became a surname just as the English word ‘Master’ is undergoing a change in usage with the Gujarati-speaking people and the word ‘professor’ may soon have with the Mara1t2hi1-speaking people.^1 Devabhat2t2a was a bra1hman2a. He was an inhabitant of Pun2d2ravardhana. He belonged to Va1jasaneyacaran2a, and was versed in the four Vedas.

Kurama1 means bad (or misused) wealth and ‘ravya’ means ‘famous’; bhat2t2a is a surname added to the names of scholarly bra1hman2as. So the whole expression may mean ‘a teacher who is known for the ill use of his wealth’. Though such queer names are actually in practice it is not unlikely that in the present case it is the nick-name which has been mentioned.

विष्णुपालितभट्ट
3. Vis2n2upa1litabhat2t2a (No. 39, L. 5): He was the son of Kurama1ravyabhat2t2a, a teacher of the Chandoga (Veda), with the gotras As4va and Va1jin.

The second part ‘sva1min’ means ‘a spiritual proceptor, learned bra1hman2a or Pan2d2ita’ (used as a title at the end of names, especially of natives of the Karnataka).^6

जयभट्टिस्वामिन्
2. Jayabhat2t2isva1min (No. 40, L. 6):  The first part of the name is Jayabhat2t2i. Jaya literally means triumph or being victorious (in battle, lawsuit, etc.) It was also the name of Arjuna (the son of Pa1n2d2u), Indra, the sun, of an attendant of Vis2n2u and of many sages.^7 Bhat2t2a or Bhat2t2i is affixed to the names of learned bra1hman2as.^8 As explained above, the second part of the name sva1min is the surname added to the names of learned bra1hman2as. Jayabhat2t2isva1min was a bra1hman2a and has been mentioned as traividya in subsequent lines of the inscription^9 (L. 8; L. 9). Miscellaneous

अमृतदेव

The term can mean ‘the god Amr2ta1’ which is the name of Lord Vis2n2u or we may call him ‘the god of nectar’ (Amr2tasya deva).

देव
2. Deva (No. 16, L. 5): It is an abbreviated name without any surname. Literally it means ‘god, heavenly, divine’ (also said of terrestrial things of high excellence.)^10 It is also the name of men, and is used as a short form for Devadatta.^11 Deva of our inscription belonged to the community of the Caturvedins of the locality called Padma1 in the town of Indrapura.

देवविष्णु
3. Devavis2n2u (No. 16, L, 5): The first part is ‘Deva’ which means ‘god’. The second part is Vis2n2u which may be the name of his family deity. Devavis2n2u belonged to the community of Caturvedins of the locality called Padma1 in the city of Indrapura. He performed the Agnihotra of the Ra1n2a1yan2i1ya S4akha1 of the Vedas every day.

दुडिक
4. Dud2ika (No. 16, L. 5): He was a bra1hman2a belonging to the community of Caturvedins of the locality known as Padma1 in the city of Indrapura. He has been mentioned as the great grand-father of the bra1hman2a De4vavis2n2u, the giver of an endowment for the maintenance of a lamp in the temple of the god Sun. It is an abbreviated name with the ending “ika”^12 like Devika for Devadatta; Yajn5ika for Yajn5adatta and Chadika for Chandodatta.^13  The name ‘D2ad2d2a’, ‘D2ud2d2a’ or ‘D2ud2d2a1’^14 cannot be derived from any Sanskrit root. Nor are these names found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. Dr. H.D. Sankalia suggests that these names were derived from the Sanskrit term Dardara,^15 meaning ‘a mountain’, or a region having holes or ravines. The man may have shifted from a hilly region. We find references to geographical names like ‘Daddarapabbata’ and ‘Maha1daddara’ in the Daddara Ja1taka.^16 The Daddarapabbata may be identified with the mountainous tract of Dardistan, lying to the north-west of Kashmir, and south of Little Pamir. Since the river Sindhu after its origin in the Himalayas near Tibet flows through this country, Pa1n2ini calls the river Da1radi1 Sindhuh2.^17 The people of this tract, the Daradas are mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata in the list of the foreign tribes which sprang up along with the Yavanas, Mlecchas and S4akas, from the cow Ka1madhenu, when she was being forcibly driven away by Vis4va1mitra from Vasis2t2ha's a1s4rama.^18 The Daradas are the people, living above Peshawar.^19 But the basic weakness in the suggestion made by Dr. H.D. Sankalia^20 is, as he himself admits, these names are not found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. It may be noted that the words D2od2a and D2od2d2a are synonyms used for a bra1hman2a and D2od2in2i1 stands for a bra1hman2i1, or a bra1hman2a-woman.^21 These are des4ya words and hence refer to local elements. In Punjabi language a person who is very simple or credulous or who can be very easily cheated is called ‘D2od2a’. It is not unlikely that on account of his pious ways and bookish approach a bra1hman2a was generally taken to be a simple person. In the Sanskrit story books the picture of a typical bra1hman2a is that of a simpleton who can be easily duped. Hence it is possible that a bra1hman2a was called ‘D2od2a’ and the feminine form of ‘D2od2a’ (i. e. D2od2in2i1) was used for a bra1hman2a-woman2.^22 In Karnataka ‘D2od2d2u’ means ‘big’ or elder. ‘D2od2d2a1ca1rya’ or ‘D2ud2d2a1ca1rya’ a term of respect for a learned Pan2d2ita is also used in satire.  It is interesting to note that D2ad2d2a is also an English slang word meaning ‘a foolish person’.

हरित्रात
5. Haritra1ta (No. 16, L. 5): The first part of the name is Hari, which means ‘God’ and is also the name among others of Lord Vis2n2u and Kr2s2n2a. Generally Hari is derived from § hr2’ to take away or remove evil or sin.^23 The second part ‘tra1ta’ means ‘protected’. Thus the whole literally means ‘protected by Hari’.^24 Haritra1ta was a bra1hman2a belonging to the community of the Caturvedins of the locality called Padma1 in the town named Indrapura.

कर्प्पटिक
6. Karppat2ika^25 (No. 34, L. 6): The inscription records the purchase of land measuring one kulyava1pa by a bra1hman2a, named Karppatika, for the purpose of his agnihotra rites. The word ‘Karpat2ika’ or Ka1rpat2ika means ‘acting deceitfully, fradulent, dishonest, a rogue, cheat’.^26 It also means a beggar.^27 Both the meanings may be applied here.

त्रैविद्य
7. Traividya (No. 40, L. 8; L. 9): His real name which occurs in L. 6 of the inscription was ‘Jayabhat2t2isva1min’. He was also known as Traividya The term literally means ‘one who knows the three Vedas -R2k, Sa1ma and Yajus’. NAMES OF JAINAS AND BAUDDHAS

अभयमित्र
1. Abhayamitra (No. 48, L. 2; No. 54, L. 2): The name consisting of two parts ‘abhaya’ and ‘mitra’ can mean a friend of unfearfulness or ‘an unfearful friend’. ‘Abhaya’ is also the name of Lord S4iva^28 and ‘mitra’ is a synonym for the god Sun. Thus it may also be a name formed by combining the names of two deities as in the case of Ra1makr2s2n2a. Abhayamitra was the name of a Buddhist monk who caused a pratima1 to be built.

भद्र
2. Bhadra (No. 22, L. 4): It is the name of a Jaina A1ca1rya. Literally it means ‘blessed, auspicious, fortunate, prosperous, happy’. Bhadra is also the name of Lord S4iva.^29

भट्टिभव
3. Bhat2t2ibhava (No. 31, L. 2):  The image on which the Mathura1 Jaina Inscription of Kuma1ragupta I, of G. E. 113 is inscribed was set up by S4a1ma1d2hya1 (S4ya1ma1d2hya1), the daughter of Bhat2t2ibhava. Bhat2t2ibhava seems to have been a bra1hman2a-follower of Jainism. Bhat2t2a or Bhat2t2i, a surname meaning ‘a teacher’ has been put here before Bhava. Bhat2t2i is the Prakritised form of Sanskrit ‘Bharti’ meaning a lord or master which came to be accepted as a Sanskrit word. ‘Bhava’ means ‘a god, deity’ and is also the name of Lord S4iva. Bhava also means ‘prosperity, welfare’.^30 Thus the full name literally means ‘one who is a (source of) prosperity, for his teacher’. It can also be a case of a name after the deity ‘Bhava’ or ‘S4iva’.

भट्टिसोम
4. Bhat2t2isoma (No. 15, L. 6): It was the name of a Jaina worshipper. He is described as a maha1tman the son of Somila who was a treasure-house of many virtues. The name Bhat2t2i-soma literally means, “Who is just like a Soma (a life-giving element) for his teacher.” It can as well be a case of a name after the deity Soma.

बुद्धमित्र
5. Buddhamitra (No. 11, L. 1): ‘Buddha’ refers to ‘Lord Buddha’ and ‘mitra’ means friend. The whole thus literally means ‘a friend of Lord Buddha’. It is the name of a Buddhist monk.

दतिलाचार्य्य
6. Datila1ca1ryya (No. 31, L. 2): He was a Jaina a1ca1ryya. The correct form of the name should have been Dattila1ca1rya. The word seems to be in a Prakritised form. According to Monier Williams^31 ‘Dattila’ is one of the forms of names terminating in ‘datta’. Names like Devadatta when contracted may turn into Dattila.^32 A1ca1ryya seems to be an epithet.

गोशर्म्मन्
7. Gos4armman (No. 22, LL. 4-5): ‘Go’ means cow and s4armman means ‘shelter or protection’.^33 Thus the whole may literally mean ‘one who is a shelter for the cows’. A1ca1ryya Gos4armman mentioned as a muni seems to have been a Jaina A1ca1ryya.

गुहनन्दिन्
8. Guhanandin (No. 39, L. 6; L. 13): The first part Guha is the name of Skanda^34 and the second part is nandin; meaning thereby, ‘one who is a servant of Lord Skanda’. Guhanandin was the name of a Jaina A1ca1ryya. The names of the Digam3bara A1ca1ryas of the third and  fourth centuries, such as Yas4onandin Jayanandin, and Kuma1ranandin generally end in nandin. As Pun2d2ravardhana was one of the seats of Jaina pontiffs, beginning with Gupti-Gupta or Vis4a1kha1ca1ryya, the disciple of Bhadraba1hu II, it has been suggested that Guhanandin also belonged to the same place.^35

जितसेन
9. Jitasena (No. 52, L. 30): The first part of the name ‘Jita’ means ‘won’. ‘Sena’ the second part of the name, generally refers to an army but in the present case we may translate it better as ‘body’ which is supported by lexicographers.^36 Thus the whole may literally mean ‘One who has won the body’, i.e. one having control over one's senses’. This would suit the context because Jitasena was an a1ca1ryya of the Buddhist order.^37

कपित
10. Kapita (No. 41, L. 6): It is a name based on colour. Kapila means ‘monkey-coloured’ or ‘yellow-coloured’. He was one of the teachers of the Ma1hes4vara cult and has been mentioned as Bhagava1n Kapila.

कुशिक
11. Kus4ika (No. 41, L. 5): He is described as one of the pupils of Lakulin (Nakulin in the Va1yu Pura1n2a), an incarnation of Mahes4vara.^38 It is an abbreviated name formed by the addition of the surffix ‘ika’. According to lexicographers literally Kus4ika means ‘squinteyed’.^39 In the present inscription the name has the epithet bhagava1n prefixed to it.

मद्र
12. Madra (No. 15, L. 8): He was a follower of Jaina cult full of affection for bra1hman2as and religious preceptors and ascetics and set up five stone images of A1dikartr2s or Ti1rtham3karas, i.e. the five images in the niches of the column and the column itself, at the village of Kakubha, i.e., Kahaum. Madra is the name of a country to the north-west of Hindustan proper, or a king (pl. the people) of this country. It was also the name of a son of S4ibi (the progenitor of the Madras).^40 Ma1dri1, we get the name of a princess of Madra.^41 Literally it means ‘joy’.^42

पराशर
13. Para1s4ara (No. 41, L. 6): He is mentioned as an a1ca1rya of the Ma1hes4vara cult. The epithet ‘Bha1gavan’ has been prefixed to his name. Literally Para1s4ara means ‘a crusher, destroyer’.^43 Para1s4ara is also the  name of an ancient sage, an authority on Jyotis2a, Kr2s2i, Vr2ks2a1yurveda and Dharmas4a1stra.

पार्श्व
14. Pa1rs4va (No. 22, L. 3): The name has its origins in Pa1rs4va or Pa1rs4vana1tha; the best of the Jinas. It is the name of the 23rd Arhat of the present cycle and his servant.^44

रुद्रसोम
15. Rudrasoma (No. 15, L. 7): He is the son of Bhat2t2isoma who has been mentioned as a maha1tma1. He is described as having another appellation of Vya1ghra.^45 It may be a name formed by the combination of the names of two deities Rudra and Soma.

शंकर
16. S4am3kara (No. 22, L. 6): It is the name of a Jaina monk^46, who installed an image of Pa1rs4vana1tha. Literally meaning ‘causing prosperity’, it is one of the common names of Lord S4iva.^47 The present case goes against the traditions of the Smr2tis which forbid the giving of the names of deities directly to human beings.

सनसिद्ध
17. Sanasiddha (No. 23, L. 1; L. 9): It was the name of an upa1saka. It seems to be a Prakritised form of Sanskrit ‘svayam3 siddha’^48, meaning ‘existing on one's own strength’. Another possibility is that as ‘sana’ means ‘old, ancient’,^49 the whole may mean ‘Siddha’ of old’. It may be noted that in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a sanas4ruta (meaning famous of old) appears as the name of a man.

शान्तिदेव
18. S4a1ntideva (No. 52. L. 4): He was a Buddhist monk of the Maha1ya1na school and has been mentioned as A1ca1ryya S4a1ntideva.^50 The name S4a1ntideva was quite popular among the Buddhists. Literally the name means ‘the god of tranquillity or prosperity’.

19. Somila (No. 15, L. 6): It is the name of a follower of Jainism whose great grandson Madra is mentioned as having established the five excellent images referring to the five named Jaina Tirtham3karas sculptured on the column (viz., A1dina1tha, S4a1ntina1tha, Nemina1tha, Pa1rs4vana1tha and Maha1vi1ra).^51 Somila can be an abbreviated form of the name ‘Somadatta’.^52 In Punjabi usage a person named ‘Somadatta’ may be addressed as ‘Somi1;’ Somila may be a similar form convenient to utter. Somila can also be formed by adding ‘ilac’ suffix to the word ‘Soma’ and hence meaning ‘full of  Soma’. Somila was the name of a poet.^53 Ka1lida1sa also mentions a poet named Saumila (identical with Somila) along with Bha1sa.^54 In the Katha1saritsa1gara Somila is the name of an Asura.

उदिचार्य्य
20. Udi (ta1) ca1ryya (No. 41, L. 8): Udita means ‘proclaimed’ or ‘high’^55 and ‘a1ca1ryya’ means teacher, the whole literally meaning ‘a high teacher’. A1rya Udita1ca1ryya was one of the a1ca1ryyas of the Ma1hes4vara cult, tenth from the Bhagava1n Kus4ika and fourth from the Bhagava1n Para1s4ara.

उपमित
21. Upamita (No. 41, L. 7): Literally the name means “compared or illustrated by comparison”,^56 or in other words ‘one who is quoted for comparison, i.e., very high or perfect’.

बलि
1. Bali (No. 14, L. 2): The reference to Bali comes in connection with the praise of Lord Vis2n2u.^57 Literally meaning ‘one who is powerful or vigorous’, Bali was the son of Virocana and the grandson of Prahla1da and has been the king of the Asuras.^58 A famous legend about him runs thus -The demon Bali, by his austerities acquired the dominion over the three worlds, and caused annoyance and anxiety to the gods. Vis2n2u then reincarnated himself as a dwarf, appeared before Bali, and asked for as much land as he could cover with three strides. Bali assented to his request, and Vis2n2u with two strides covered the heavens and the earth, but, in commiseration for Bali, who then humbled himself, left him the dominion over the lower regions below the earth.^59 We get a reference to this legend as early as in the Vis2n2usu1kta of the R2gveda.^60

बुद्ध
2. Buddha (No. 23, LL. 6-7): He has been given the epithet ‘The Divine’ (Bhagava1n Buddha). He is mentioned in connection with a Buddhist temple. Literally the name means awakened, conscious or intelligent. For Buddhists it stands for a fully enlightened man who has achieved perfect knowledge of the truth and thereby is liberated from all existence and before his own attainment of Nirva1n2a reveals the method of obtaining it. The principal Buddha of the present age was born at Kapilavastu in the year 566 B.C.^61 His father S4uddhodana was the Ra1ja1 of that district. His mother was Ma1ya1devi1, and his original name was Siddha1rtha. He belonged to the Ks2atriya S4a1kya tribe, while Gautama seems to refer to the race to which his family belonged. He had left his home in quest of truth and after a concentrated  meditation for a few years attained the discovery of truths and was called the Buddha or the enlightened.^62

कृष्ण
3. Kr2s2n2a (No. 13, L. 13): It is a name based on colour, meaning black-dark, dark-blue. “Vasudeva, a descendant of Yadu and Yaya1ti, had by his second wife Devaki1, eight sons of whom the last, Kr2s2n2a, was born with black-skin and a peculiar mark on his breast”.^63 Yas4oda1 was Kr2s2n2a's foster-mother to whom he was shifted in Gokula or Vraja immediately after his birth to escape the cruel hands of Kam3sa. In our inscription Skandagupta has been compared with Lord Kr2s2n2a, who after slaying his enemy Kam3sa had returned to his mother Devaki1.^64

पार्थ
4. Pa1rtha (No. 17, L. 14; No. 19, L. 5): In No. 17, king Vis4vavarman is compared with Pa1rtha in (heroic) deeds of war. In No. 19 Bha1nugupta is described as a mighty king equal to Pa1rtha, exceedingly heroic. Pa1rtha is formed from Pr2tha1 and is a metronymic for Arjuna who has been mentioned in the Pura1n2as, as the husband of Subhadra1 and father of Abhimanyu.^65

पृथु
5. Pr2thu (No. 2, LL. 7-8): Samudragupta is stated to have surpassed the kings like Pr2thu and Ra1ghava in giving gold. Literally Pr2thu means broad, wide, expansive, extensive, spacious or large.^66 About nineteen Pr2thus have been mentioned in the Pura1n2as,^67 the most important and famous being the Vainya. Here the reference seems to this Pr2thu, the Vainya. He is the son of Vena got out of by the churning his right arm by the sages to save him from falling into hell and is considered the ninth incarnation of Hari. He was the first king who introduced agriculture. Due to scarcity of supply when people complained of hunger, he armed his arrow and the earth was milked. Hilly tracts were levelled and different kinds of villages, cities and towns were organised for the first time. Pr2thu has been panegyrised by the Gandharvas, and Siddhas playing on different musical instruments.^68

राघव
6. Ra1ghava (No. 2, L. 8): Samudragupta is mentioned to have surpassed the kings like Pr2thu and Ra1ghava in giving gold.^69 Ra1ghava literally means a descendant of Raghu,^70 and is used as a patronymic of Aja,  of Das4aratha and of Ra1macandra. In dual number (ra1ghavau) it refers to Ra1ma and Laks2man2a.^71

सगर
7. Sagara (No. 36, L. 12; No. 37, L. 21): He is mentioned in these inscriptions as a donor of lands.^72 Literally Sagara means ‘containing poison or poisonous’ It is the name of a king of the solar race, sovereign of Ayodhya1, son of Ba1hu. He is said to have been called Sa-gara, as born together with a poison administered to his mother by the cowives of her husband. He was father of Asaman5jasa by Kes4ini1 and of sixty thousand sons by Sumati; the latter were turned into a heap of ashes by the sage Kapila, and their funeral ceremonies could only be performed by the waters of Gan3ga1 to be brought from heaven for the purpose of purifying their remains; this was finally accomplished by Bhagi1ratha.^73

व्यास
8. Vya1sa (No. 28, L. 21; No. 29, L. 14; No. 36, L. 15; No. 43, L. 30; No. 44, L. 21; No. 52, LL. 11-12): Vya1sa has been mentioned as Bhagava1n (venerable) Vya1sa in No. 28; as Dvaipa1yana in No. 29 and as Vedavya1sa in No. 44. In No. 43, there is a reference to his saying in the Maha1bha1rata.^74 In No. 52 he is described as the compiler of the Vedas and as a son of Para1s4ara.^75 Literally Vya1sa means ‘division or extension’ and as the name of a person it signifies an arranger, complier or narrator. Vya1sa is said to have rearranged the Vedas into four parts, and taught each of them to four respective pupils -Paila, Vais4am3pa1yana, Jaimini and Sumantu; he also rearranged Itiha1sa -Pura1n2as and composed the Bha1rata and the Bha1gavata.^76 Subsequently, the name Vya1sa came to be applied to any great typical compiler or author.^77 He was the son of the sage Para1s4ara and was brought forth by his mother Satyavati1 on an island in the river Yamuna1. Hence he is also known as Dvaipa1yana and Ba1dara1yan2a.^78 As he was called Kr2s2n2aDvaipa1yana, it seems that Vya1sa, Dvaipa1yana, and Ba1dara1yan2a were epithets; his original name might have been Kr2s2n2a due to his dark complexion,^79 and he was called ‘Dvaipa1yana for being born on an island (dvi1pa).’

युधिष्ठिर
9. Yudhis2t2hira (No. 28, L. 24; No. 29, L. 16; No. 35, L. 12; No. 36, L. 17; No. 43, L. 33; No. 44, L. 24; No. 52, L. 14):  He is mentioned in the imprecatory verses and is described as the best of kings. Literally meaning ‘firm or steady in battle’, it was the name of the eldest of the five sons of Pa1n2d2u. He was father of Prativindhya and Sudhanu and before his death installed his grandson Pari1ks2ita on the throne (at Hastinapur) and Vajra at Mathura1.^80

दामस्वामिनी
1. Da1masva1mini1 (No. 55, LL. 3-4): She is said to have raised a pillar in the memory of her dead parents at Ra1jgha1t2 in Va1ra1n2asi1. The first part of the name, Da1man, means a ‘rope’ or ‘girdle’^1 (originally ‘bond’, from §da1 ‘to bind’). But the Amarakos4a gives a better explanation which takes us nearer to the original meaning. It explains ‘Da1man’ as ‘Sanda1nam’, i. e., a rope tethered to a cow at the time of milking it.^2 The second part of the name is ‘sva1mini1’ which means ‘a proprietress, mistress’ or owner of (gen., loc. or comp.).^3 The parents might have given her this name out of affection as she was a helping hand in tethering the rope to the cow while milking it.^4 The name indicates affection by the parents.

देवकी
2. Devaki1 (No. 13, L. 13): The reference comes in the passage which describes how Skandagupta returned victorious to his mother just as Lord Kr2s2n2a went to Devaki1 after killing his enemy. ^5 Sewell suggests that the name of Skandagupta's mother was Devaki1 and he has been followed by some other scholars. According to D.C. Sircar the simile may further suggest that some maternal uncle of Skandagupta actually fought against him in support of his rival and that his mother, possibly not the chief queen of his father, had to experience difficulties for sometime. ^6 Devaki1 is a patronymic formed by adding ‘i1’ suffix to Devaka, literally meaning ‘divine, celestial’, who was her father.^7 She was the wife of Vasudeva and the mother of Kr2s2n2a.^8

हरिस्वामिनी
3. Harisva1mini1 (No. 23, LL. 1, 10):  Upa1sika1 (lay-worshipper) Harisva1mini1, was the wife of Upa1saka Sanasiddha who donated money to the A1rya-sam3gha (community of the faithful) at the great viha1ra (Buddhist convent) of Ka1kana1dabot2a (i. e., the great stu1pa at Sa1n5ci1) for feeding one Bhiks2u everyday and maintaining lamps in the shrines of the Buddha.^9 The first part of the name, Hari, stands alike for Lord Kr2s2n2a, Vis2n2u and S4iva. The second part is ‘Sva1mini1’ meaning mistress. Thus the whole literally means ‘one who has Hari as her master’.

पद्मावती
4. Padma1vati1 (No. 22, L. 5): She was the mother of S4am3kara, an ascetic, under whose instructions the image of the Jina-vara-pa1rs4vana1tha was made. In the inscription we have the un-Pa1n2inian use of the locative ‘Padma1vatau’ in place of ‘Padma1vatya1m’ but it seems to have been done to suit the metre. Padma1vati1 is a synonym far Laks2mi1. In India it has been a popular name for women.^10

रामी
5. Ra1mi1 (No. 28, LL. 4, 12, 17): She has been mentioned as the wife of a bra1hman2a, named Na1thas4arman. Ra1mi1 means ‘darkness or night’. ^11 It may mean ‘a woman of dark complexion’ or it can be a patronymic from Ra1ma.^12 Monier Williams mentions the form with short ‘i’ suffix (Ra1mi) but it can be with long ‘i1’ as well, as we have ‘Devaki1’ a patronymic from Devaka.^13 Chatterji mentions it to be a feminine form of Ra1ma and considers it a naming pattern prevalent among the lower classes^14

साभाटि
6. Sa1bha1t2i (No. 55, L. 3): The form of the name should have better been Sabha1t2i. She was the mother of Da1masva1mini1 who raised a pillar in her memory. The name seems to have some relation with the word Sabha1.^15 It can be an adjective from the word Sabha1 combined with §‘at2’ to move. Literally it may mean “one who moves in assemblies”.

शामाढ्या
7. S4a1ma1d2hya1 (No. 31, L. 2): S4a1ma1d2hya1 is a Prakritized form of the word ‘S4ya1ma1d2hya1’. She was the daughter of Bhat2t2ib hava and the wife of the ferryman  Grahamittrapa1lita. The first part s4a1ma’ is a contraction of Sanskrit ‘S4ya1ma’.^16 Literally the name may mean ‘S4ya1mena a1d2hya1’, i. e., having a dark or swarthy complexion which in Sanskrit poetic tradition is considered a mark of beauty.^17 

आभीर
1. A1bhi1ra (No. 1, L. 22): They were one of the tribes subdued by Samudragupta. A1bhi1ras lived to the north of the Rajaputana desert. We may also think of Abiravan between Herat and Kandahar which may have been the original home of the A1bhi1ras. In the 3rd century A.D. there was an A1bhi1ra kingdom in the northwestern Deccan.^21 D.C. Sircar^22 describes A1bhi1ra in singular as a member of the Cowherd Community. The tribe can still be traced in the present Ahi1ras,^23 who in tribal groups, abound largely in the Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Nepal and some portions of Rajasthan. They are a band of simple, sturdy people, mostly cowherds and agriculturists.^24 This tribe^25 is thought to have played a big part in the propagation of the worship of Kr2s2n2a Govinda^26 in his pastoral aspect. The Maha1bha1rata^27 places the A1bhi1ras in West Rajasthan ‘where the Sarasvati1 disappears’. In the first and second centuries A.D. they are located in the country between the lower Sindhu valley and Kathiawar, as is indicated in the ‘Periplus’ and in the Geography of Ptolemy.^28 The Periplus calls their country Abiria. A1bhi1ra generals served in the armics of S4aka Ks2atraps of Western India in the second century A.D. as is known from their inscriptions.^29 They are also mentioned in the Maha1bha1s2ya of Patan5jali^30 in association with the S4u1dras, the Sodrai of Alexander's time, who lived in northern Sind. Throughout the third century A.D. the A1bhi1ras exercised ruling power in northern Konkan and Maha1ra1shtra.^31 Va1tsya1yana^32 refers to the Harem of the A1bhi1ra kings. The Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a^33  and the Va1yu Pura1n2a^34 refer to them as ‘Daks2in2a1patha-va1sinah2’ or dwelling in the Southern Country. The Br2hat-sam3hita1^35 mentions them as being under the jurisdiction of S4ani (Saturn). The Jodhpur Inscription of Sam3vat 918, records that the A1bhi1ra people of this area were a terror to their neighbours, because of their violent demeanour.^36 The A1bhi1ra robbers are also mentioned in the Skanda Pura1n2a.^37 Epigraphic evidence indicates the existence of an A1bhi1ra kingdom in the 14th Century in Khandesh.^38 In the Sa1hitya Darpan2a of Vis4vana1tha,^39 it is stated that A1bhi1ri1 is the language of the A1bhi1ras and Ca1n2d2a1li1 of the Can2d2a1las. Those who do woodwork can speak A1bhi1ri1 or S4a1bari1, either of the two. Dan2d2in asserts that the speeches of the A1bhi1ras, etc., are termed as Apabhram3s4a in the Ka1vya^40 on the basis of which probably Keith writes: “the Prakrit lyrics passed into Apabhram3s4a as a result of the activities of the A1bhi1ras and the Gurjaras.^41 We know from the Amarakos4a^42 that ‘A1bhi1ri1’ was used to denote ‘A1bhi1ra woman or the wife of a cowherd’. The Amarakos4a^43 mentions Gopa, Gopa1la, Gosam3khya, Godhuk and Ballava as the synonyms for A1bhi1ra and says that the village or place where A1bhi1ras lived is named as Ghos2a or A1bhi1rapalli1.^44 In the Kashmirian recension of the Maha1bha1rata we get the readings ‘Ka1bhi1ra’ and ‘Kabhi1ra’ in place of A1bhi1ra.^45 These Kashmirian forms may have resulted from an attempt to record an initial glottal opening in the language of the A1bhi1ras. The Kasmiras probably knew the A1bhi1ras at an early date.^46 Bhattacharya^47 describes the A1bhi1rs or Ahi1rs as a cowherd caste exceeding 8,000,000, and found almost everywhere in India north of the Narmada1. The A1bhi1ras are mentioned as foreigners in the Pura1n2as.^48 Their kings were regarded as vra1tya and mostly s4u1dras (black).^49 In the Maha1bha1rata the A1bhi1ras are called Mleccha.^50 According to Manu^51 they were the sons of a bra1hman2a man and an ambas2t2ha woman, the Ambas2t2has being of mixed origin and known as the A1nava ks2atriyas.^52 The Br2hatsam3hita1^53 places the A1bhi1ras in the  Southern quarter of India. Shafer^54 considers them to be an admixture possibly of white Iranian blood with enough Bhil blood to give them a a very dark colour and concludes that they were western A1navas.^55

आर्जुनायनस्
2. A1rjuna1yanas (No. 1, L. 22): One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. The name A1rjuneya is mentioned in the R2gveda as the patronymic of Kautsa.^56 The tribe, associated with the name of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and the North-West up to the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.^57 The word Arjuna in the Vedic literature^58 denotes ‘white’ and ‘white lepresy’ and is also an epithet of Indra. But it does not denote a tribe or a human hero. The word Arjuna has an unmistakable resemblance with the S4aka word erzuna, meaning a ‘leader’ or ‘chief’ which is derived from arzi. Analogous to it are the S4aka words aljsa1, meaning ‘silvery’ and a1ljsata, meaning ‘silver’, that are akin to the Avestan word erezata (silver), the Sanskrit word rajata (silver) and the Persian word arziz (tin).^59 All these words have the original sense of whiteness and brightness, that are also connoted by the word arjuna in Sanskrit. It is highly significant that Arjuna, the hero of the Maha1bha1rata, is said to have borne this name, because he was ‘white’ and ‘pure’ in action.^60 All over the Eurasian steppes the nobles were regarded as ‘white’ and the commoners were considered ‘black’. Hence the word for white colour was employed to denote the idea of leadership. This is why erzuna was used in the sense of a ‘leader’ in S4aka languages.^61 Vedic and S4aka both branched from the same parent IndoEuropean language. Hence many words were common to both. But whereas arjuna in Vedic lost its pristine sense and was only used as an adjective, signifying ‘whiteness’, in S4aka it meant a ‘tribe’ and a human hero and later on this sense was imparted to this word in India as a result of the impact of the S4akas.^62 The tribe, bearing the name of Arjuna, was also connected with some people of Chinese Turkestan, whose heroes, and kings had this designation.^63 In the Uighur redaction of the  Hid2imba1vadha^64 the name of Arjuna occurs in the form of Arcuni.^65 According to Sylvain Levi, this episode of the Maha1bha1rata owed the privilege of entering into the Turkish world to the presence of the name of Arjuna in it, who was regarded as the eponymous founder of the dynasties of some Central Asiatic oases-states.^66 Pa1n2ini^67 refers to the worshipper of Arjuna, called Arjunaka, together with the devotee of Vasudeva, called Va1sudevaka. This remark implies that Arjuna was treated as a deity at the time of Pa1n2ini and his followers occupied a prominent position. ^68 The Ka1s4ika1 replaces Audda1laka1yana of Patan5jali by A1rjuna1yana,^69 the name of a tribe nearer to its own time in discussing the meaning of Pra1cya-bha1rata (II. 4. 66). From the accounts relating to the invasion of India by Alexander we learn that a tribe named Agalassoi (Arjuna1yana) fought with Alexander.^70 The Br2hat-sam3hita1^71 places the A1rjuna1yana in the northern division of India and describes them as being in the region of Br2haspati.^72 Ptolemy refers to a people in the Punjab whom he calls Pandoouoi^73 = Pa1n2d2avas with whom the A1rjuna1yanas may be connected.^74 A1rjuna1yana coins are found in the Mathura1 region and ‘they may be assigned with probability to the region lying west of Agra and Mathura, equivalent, roughly speaking, to the Bharatpur and Alwar States’.^75

आटविकराज
3. A1t2avika-ra1ja (No. 1, L. 21): It is stated in the inscription that Samudragupta made all the kings of the forest countries his servants.^76 A mention of the forest kingdoms has also been made in Khoh Copper plate inscription of Sam3kshobha Gupta year 209.^77 These 18 forest kingdoms were apparently in Central India including D2a1hala or the Jabalpur region. ^78 We find a reference to the same in the Kanas plate of Lokavigraha.^79 The Va1yu and Matsya Pura1n2as (XLV, 126 and CXIII, 48) read A1t2avyas which is no doubt the correct reading. A1t2avi1 as a city of the Deccan is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata.^80 The A1t2avyas were certainly the same as the A1t2avikas of the Allahabad Pillar Inscription and were perhaps aboriginal tribes dwelling in the jungle tracts of Central India.^81 We find  a reference to the A1t2avikas or the forest savages in the Arthas4a1stra of Kaut2ilya and it was an Arthas4a1stra practice to hire the A1t2avikas as scouts and army auxiliaries,^82 which needs must influence their future advance to civilization. A1t2avika-ra1ja should be translated as ‘forest-kings’ or ‘kings of forest countries’. We get a reference to Ja1n3galas in the Puranic List of Peoples.^83 Similar terms ‘vana-ra1s2t2ra’ ‘forest-countries’ and vana-ra1jya ‘forest-kingdoms’ also occur in the Br2hatSam3hita1.^84 But these countries lay in the north-east division of India, as mapped out by Vara1hamihira, and they are, at any rate, not the countries referred here.^85 In the Critical Edition of the Maha1bha1rata, in one line of Sahadeva's digvijaya, Professor Franklin Edgerton changes A1t2avi1 to Anta1khi, so that the line will refer to Antioch, Rome and the Greeks. Antioch, Rome and Greece were intimately associated in history and consequently they are still associated in the minds of Western scholars, and hence Anta1khi made more sense to Edgerton in connection with Rome and the Greeks than A1t2avi1. But it only represents his personal opinion.^86

दैवपुत्र
4. Daivaputra^87 (No. 1, L. 23): Daivaputras along with S2a1his, S2a1ha1nus2a1his, S4akas and Murun2d2as are mentioned to have paid homage to Samudragupta by rendering to him all kinds of service. The word ‘Daivaputra’ denotes those ‘who belong to devaputra’, i. e., Kanis2ka, i. e., the Kus2a1n2a ruler. The title devaputra has frequently been used as a title by the Kus2a1n2a kings.^88 The common belief is that the designation devaputra ‘godson’ was copied by the Kus2a1n2as from the ancient Chinese imperial title, ‘T’ien-tzu’, ‘son of heaven’.^89 Thomas considers that this title used by the Kus2a1n2as must have been borrowed from the Hsiung-nu (a Central Asian Tribe) and not directly from the Chinese.^90 Narain also believes the title to have been borrowed by the Kus2a1n2as from Central Asia.^91 The title has been frequently used by the kings in the Kharos2t2hi1 documents discovered from Chinese Turkestan.^92 As regards the origin of the title, the divinity of the kings has been stressed upon in many ancient empires.^93 The ancient Indian concept for ‘Deva putra’^94 meaning ‘god-son’ is slightly different. It was not used for worldly kings but specifically for a class of distinguished divinites, which in Indian Buddhist texts was specifically used for four regional ‘great kings’, i. e., regents of four quarters, East, West, North and South who were ‘sons of heaven’. In the later Kus2a1n2a times, the term seems to have denoted the sense of Royal insignia.^95 In a Buddhist text of this period the question is raised ‘why kings are called devaputra’ and the answer is that before being born as a man, he was abiding among the gods (devas) and that, because the thirty-three gods (each) contributed to his substance, therefore, he is ‘god-son’.^96 That Daivaputra denotes the Kus2a1n2as is obvious, since, no other Indian king is known to have been styled ‘devaputra’. Though Indian kings were usually addressed as ‘Deva’, we do not find any evidence of an Indian king referring to himself as deva. The Kus2a1n2as did not adopt devaputra as an official title in early times. It is totally absent from their coins, its reading on one coin of Kujula Kara Kaphsa being an error which has been noticed by Thomas after re-examining the coin in consultation with Allan.^97 Kanis2ka has not used the title even in Peshawar Casket Inscriptions which were officially engraved. It is only in documents inscribed by Indians that the title ‘devaputra’ is used for the Kus2a1n2a kings.^98 The title is used for the first time for Kanis2ka (known as Candana Kanis2ka).^99 Maha1ra1ja -ra1ja1tira1ja devaputra Kus2a1n2a of the Taxila Silver Scroll Inscription is generally taken to refer to Kanis2ka.^100 As rightly observed by Thomas “the devaputrasa of the scroll inscription is the first known instance of the application to the Kus2a1n2as of the designation devaputra, which regularly, though not invariably, recurs with Kanis2ka and his successors.”^101 Thus we do not find the title Devaputra being used by the Kus2a1n2a rulers themselves but was applied to them by the Indians. Why of all ruling dynasties only the Kus2a1n2as were designated as ‘Devaputras’ is really inexplicable. Thomas suggests two possibilities. It may be due to the fact that the Indians saw some similarity between the figures of the grand Yaks2a and those of the burly Kusa1n2a kings and the superior title of ‘Devaputra’ may have appeared to be a suitable appel lation. Another possibility is that they found some similarity between the Kus2a1n2a kings and Kubera (described in India as regent of the north and god of wealth and known as Devaputra in ancient Indian concept of Devaputra which simply means god-son), especially in view of the lavish gold coinage of the Kus2a1n2as. As4vaghos2a refers to the ‘great king Kanika’ as ‘guardian of the northern heaven’.^102 It is also likely that the title devaputra may have been given due to S4iva-mahes4vara, whom we have seen styled as Devaputra and who is the sole deity figured on the coins of Wima Kadphises.^103 These facts need further investigation. Most probably from the Epic Period, Indian concept of Devaputra ‘god-son’ is linked with kings to give them divinity and not as a title.^104 As4oka could claim the title only of ‘Deva1na1m priya’^105 meaning ‘the beloved of the gods’. Thus Devaputra or ‘god-son’ was a superior title given to the Kus2a1n2as by Indians. It is interesting to note that the epithet Devaputravat has been used for Buddha in one of our inscriptions^106

हूण
5. Hu1n2a (No. 13, L. 15): They are mentioned in the Bhi1tari1 Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta in which Skandagupta (A.D. 455 -467) is stated to have inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Hu1n2as: “By whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict with the Hu1n2as...”.^107 The defeat inflated upon the Hu1n2as proved so decisive that for nearly half a century the Gupta empire was immune from their depredations.^108 Hu1n2as, also known as Ephthalites or Hiung-nu were a Central Asian tribe. Uigur^109 transcribes the name of the tribe in ancient Chinese in two phonetic forms: one of which is ‘xu1nu or xunu’, the other ‘xunux, xunuo, xunu’. The first part (xun -) of the last form is not in doubt and neither is the u of the last part, the only question is about the change of the initial i of ancient Chinese into y in Uigur before u and in Sandhi, and about the pronunciation of the final consonant.^110 The first of the above Chinese forms which comes as close to the Hunu as to the Sanskrit Hu1n2a is very similar to the  Chinese “transcription” Xunu or Xu1nu, and Avesta Hunu, except the Sanskrit has substituted for the final root vowel ‘u’ the stem final -a characteristic of the names of peoples in that language. “The Pura1n2as have a form Urn2a which together with Epic Skr. Hu1n2a suggests Indic Hu1rn2a Turk, Xu1rnu”.^111 We may note here the Tibetan Hor, which corresponds with the first syllable of the reconstructed form Hu1r-n2a. The difference of vowels may indicate a back dipthong or back vowel between o and u, as Ptolemy's Xou1noi suggests, since the Greeks wrote u (y) for Indic u.^112 Though all the above forms go back to one primitive form, we cannot say the same for the people to whom they were applied. The general opinion is that the Hsiung-nus, Huns, Hu1n2as etc., were Turks. Some scholars consider them to have been a mixture of many tribes, Iranians, Mongols, and Paleosibirians (ancestors of the Yenissei-ostyaks). Whatever may have been the dominant race or speech was, it can be seen that there must have been several subject people and subject armies in such far-flung empires, necessitating some mixture and mutual influence -ethnic, linguistic and cultural.^113 Otto Maenchen-Helfen has discussed the whole question on the basis of the evidence of language, history, ethnology, and archaeology^114 and has pointed out that the greater part of the Hsiung-nu vocabulary pointed to Mongol^115 Later Pelliot considered the same vocabulary and established that the Hsiung-nu and Huns were Turks.^116 Louis Bazin^117 and Von Gabain^118 also reached the conclusion that in language of the Hsiung-nu there was a high percentage of Turkish words.^119 In the second century B.C. the Hiung-nu (Huns) started a movement near the Chinese frontier and succeeded in destroying the Greco-Bactrian empire, in strongly menacing the existence of the house of Arsakes, and in landing crowds of Central Asian invaders within the borders of India. In the latter half of the fourth century A.D., a brach of them, the White Huns, or Ephthalites, flooded the South of Asia; and ‘about the time when the last legions of Rome shattered on the plains of Chalons, the motley hordes of Attila, the White Huns had begun to tread Sassanian Persia under the hoofs of their  horses, and were soon to smash the Indian empire of the Guptas into pieces’.^120 In A.D. 484 the Hu1n2as killed the Sassanian ruler of Persia. Towards the close of the fifth century A.D. they ruled over a vast empire with their principal capital at Balkh.^121 We know of a Hu1n2a-des4a placed to the South of the Ka1ma-giri and to the North of Maru-des4a, i. e., the desert called the land of heroes. The Hars2acarita places the Hu1n2a country in the Punjab region practically suggesting the same area.^122 In the middle of the sixth century A.D., the Sassanian king of Persia made an alliance with Western Turks against the Hu1n2as and smashed their rule from the Oxus by killing their king sometime between A.D. 563 and 567.^123 We know of Torama1n2a from his Eran2 Boar Inscription^124 and of Mihirakula from his Gwalior Inscription.^125 These two are generally taken to have been Hu1n2a chiefs. There is another inscription found at Kura (Salt range in the Punjab) refering to Ra1ja1dhira1ja Maha1ra1ja Torama1n2a-S2a1hi-Jau (bla), whom some scholars identify with king Torama1n2a mentioned in the Eran2 Inscription,^126 but others regard the two as quite different.^127 Here it must be pointed out, none of these inscriptions describes any of these kings as Hu1n2as nor contains any reference to the Hu1n2as. We find an interesting account of Torama1n2a in the Jain work, Kuvalayama1la1, composed to 700 S4aka (A.D. 778).^128 Here Torama1n2a is stated to have lived on the bank of the Candrabha1ga1 (Chenab river). His guru Hari-gupta, who himself was a scion of the Gupta family, also lived there.^129 Both Torama1n2a and Mihirakula are referred to in the Ra1jataran3gin2i1, but there is no mention of their being the Hu1n2as. It is doubtful whether Torama1n2a and Mihirakula were Hu1n2as or Kus2a1n2as. Sir Aurel Stein, Jayaswal^130 and Fleet^131 held that Torama1n2a was a Kus2a1n2a. But Sten Konow^132 holds that Torama1n2a was, in all probability, a Hu1n2a, as is generally assumed, and not a Kus2a1n2a. It is not unlikely that the Hu1n2as and the Kus2a1n2as were ethnically allied and were later merged into a new nation, which came to be known as Hu1n2a in India.^133 There are several stray references to the Hu1n2as in Indian literature. D.C. Sircar^134 opines that the Indian names Hu1n2a,  Ha1rahu1n2a or Ha1rahu1ra, supposed to be associated with the Chinese name Hiung-nu and ‘the White Hun’ of the European writers, are mentioned in a few late passages of the Maha1bha1rata and in the geographical sections of the early Pura1n2as, can be roughly assigned to the 4th century A.D. A su1tra-vr2tti in the Candra Vya1karan2a has the sentence ‘ajayad-gupta (or Japto or Jarto) Hu1n2a1n’ as an illustration of the use of the imperfect to express an event which occurred within the life-time of the author.^135 In the Mandasor inscription of Yas4odharman^136 a reference is made to the chiefs of the Hu1n2as, but they are not named. The inscription simply says that Yas4odharman possessed countries which not even the Guptas and the chiefs of the Hu1n2as could subdue.^137 The inscription also refers to Mihirakula “who had earlier bowed only to the god Stha1n2u (S4iva) and whose forehead was pained through being bent low down by the strength of the arm of Yas4odharman in the act of compelling obeisance”.^138 With the fall of Yas4odharman, which probably took place not long after, Mihirakula again came to the forefront. In the early part of the sixth century A.D. S4a1kala become his capital.^139 The Gupta king who then occupied the imperial throne was probably Narasim3ha-Gupta Ba1la1ditya. He was temporarily overwhelmed by the victorious raids of Yas4odharman, and Mihirakula evidently took advantage of this imperial crisis to extend his power. Narasim3hagupta, according to Hiuen Tsang, was forced to the humiliating position of paying tribute to Mihirakula but finally triumphed over his rival.^140 The defeat of Mihirakula appears to have finally crushed the political supremacy of the Hu1n2as in India who ceased to be even a disturbing element in Indian History.^141 The Pura1n2as place the Hu1n2as in the extreme west, with the Sauvi1ras, Saindhavas, S4a1kalas and Madras.^142 In the Raghuvam3s4a, Ka1lida1sa mentions Raghu defeating the Hu1n2as on the banks of the Van3ks2u or the Oxus^143, the (pale) faces of whose wives spoke of the bravery of their husbands (who died in the battle).^144 Vara1hamihira^145 mentions them under the jurisdiction of Ketu and places them in the North.^146 Dr. Upendra Thakur^147  remarks that about the sixth century A.D., the Hu1n2as almost lost their original name of Hiong-nou or Huns. Later the powerful Turks give its name to the entire Hu1n2a nation by which they were further known in the neighbouring nations. Afterwards they were submerged in the Mongols under the influence of the powerful Mongol Chief Chengiz Khan. Thus, the Hiong-nou or Huns received different names in different periods beginning with their origin to their advancement in other countries. In spite of the copious references to the Ephthalites in the accounts of the different countries, it is very difficult to determine their exact origin and ethnic affinities. We can partly agree with Dr. Thakur as regards their merger in the area later dominated by the Turks and Mongols but the Hu1n2as find their mention in the Hars2a-Carita of Ba1n2a (a seventh century work) and they remained a potent force in the social and political life of the Punjab-Rajasthan-MalwaGujarat region during the early medieval period as evidenced by a large number of epigraphical and literary records, and also proved themselves as a source of danger to the Pa1la kings of Bengal^148

6. Ka1kas (No. 1, L. 22): One of the tribes who paid homage to Samudragupta. The Ka1kas are mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata^149 and are associated with the Vidarbhas, a well-known people occupying tracts of territory in modern Madhya Pradesh.^150 V.A. Smith connects them with Ka1kana1da near Sa1n5ci1;^151 while the Bombay Gazetteer identifies them with Ka1kupur near Bithur. ^152 They may have been neighbours of the Sanaka1ni1kas.^153

7. Kharaparikas (No. 1, L. 22): One of the tribes who were subjugated by Samudragupta. D.R. Bhandarkar^154 takes them to be the Kharparas mentioned in the Batihagadh Inscription^155 of the Damoh district of M.P. Kharpara^156 means a thief, a rogue or a cheat. The name Kharaparika does not occur elsewhere in inscriptions or literature. The Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a^157 mentions a tribe called Khara-sa1gara-ra1s4i1s,^158 along with the Gandharas and the Yaudheyas; and the Matsya Pura1n2a^159 refers to a country named Kharapatha, watered by the river Nalini1. It is difficult to say whether Khara-sa1gara-ra1s4i1 and Kharapatha  had anything to do with the Kharaparikas.^160 K.P. Jayaswal expresses the probability of the identification of the Kharaparikas with the five Karpat2as of the Maha1bha1rata.^161

कोतस्
8. Kotas (No. 1, L. 14): The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta mentions Samudragupta's capturing a king born in the family of the Kotas.^162 Mookerji equates the Kota-kulaja of the inscription with king Kalya1n2avarman of the play ‘Kaumudi1-Mahotsava’.^163 But it is now generally believed^164 that ‘the episode of the Kaumudi1-Mahotsava has no bearing whatsoever on the early Gupta History’. The coins of the Kotas bearing their name have been found in East Punjab, and Delhi, and ‘they probably ruled in the Upper Gangetic valley’.^165 Scholars differ in their views about placing the Kotas; some identify it with Kanyakubja while others with Pa1t2aliputra.^166 It is known that Pus2papura or Kusumapura was the name of both the Pa1t2aliputra and Ka1nyakubja.^167 It must, however, be noted that the city of Pus2pa here is connected mainly with Samudragupta and not with the Kota-kulaja,^168 so the location of the city of the Kotas is not to be traced in Kusumapura or Pus2papura. It is well known that Candragupta I received Magadha through his Licchavi-alliance and it is possible that Samudragupta enjoyed his youth playfully at Pa1t2aliputra (Pus2pa-a1hvaye kri1d2ata1). So Goyal's assumption that ‘Haris2en2a has referred to Ka1nyakubja and not Pa1t2aliputra’^169 is incorrect. It is only later that Ka1nyakubja gains the honour of being called Kusumapura when the glory of Pa1t2aliputra had started declining.^170 In view of the context of the victory over Kota-kulaja along with the Na1ga kings Acyuta and Na1gasena and with the support of numismatic evidence it may be said that the kotas lived somewhere between East Punjab and Delhi.

कुरुस्
9. Kurus (No. 22, L. 7): The Kurus were divided into two branches, the Northern and the Southern.^171 We have here a reference to the Uttarakurus.^172 The Kurus were one of the most ancient and prominent of the Indo-A1ryan ks2atriya tribes.^173 In the earliest literature the Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But  mention is made of a prince, Kurus4ravan2a (Glory of the Kurus)^174 and of a Pa1kastha1man Kauravya1yan2a.^175 The Atharvaveda^176 refers to Pari1ks2ita as a king of the Kurus and his son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the S4a1tapatha Bra1hman2a^177 as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice. Oldenberg^178 seems to be right in suggesting that the Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to by other names in the R2gveda. Kurus4ravan2a, shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the R2gveda called Tra1sadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ who is well known as a king of the Purus. Moreover, it is likely that the Tr2tsu-Bharatas, who appear in the R2gveda as enemies of the Purus, later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people.^179 Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the R2gveda^180 as having kindled fire on the Dr2s2advati1, the A1paya1, and the Sarasvati1 -that is to say, in the sacred places of the later Kurukshetra.^181 In the Bra1hman2a literature, the Kurus are often connected with Pa1n5ca1las.^182 The territory of the Kuru-Pa1n5ca1las is declared in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a to be the middle country (Madhyades4a).^183 A group of the Kuru people still remained further north -the Uttara Kurus beyond the Himalayas.^184 It appears from a passage of the S4a1tapatha Bra1hman2a that the speech of the Northerners-that is, presumably the Northern Kurus-and of the Kuru -Pa1n5ca1las was similar, and regarded as specially pure.^185 There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical Culture was developed in the country of the Kuru-Pa1n5ca1las, and that it spread thence east, south and west. ^186 The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a.^187 where they are located beyond the Himalayas (paren2a Himavantam). In another passege,^188 however, the country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vasis2t2ha Sa1thavya to be a land of the gods (deva-ks2etra), but Ja1nm3tapi Atyara1ti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the  northern Kurus were settled in Kashmir, especially as Kurukshetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kashmir might naturally be found.^189 In Buddhist literature, UttaraKuru is very often mentioned as a mythic region, but there are some passages which go to show that there was a faint memory of a country that once had a historical existence.^190 Some time before the fourth century B.C., the monarchical constitution of the Kurus gave place to a republic, for we are told by Kaut2ilya^191 that the Kurus were ‘ra1ja-s4abdopaji1vinah2’, or ‘enjoying the status of ra1jan’ -i. e. all citizens had equal rank and rights.^192 Shafer^193 shows that only the upper castes of the Kauravas were A1ryan, the bulk of the population were probably nonA1ryan as is clear from the fact that whereas the Kauravas rallied the support mostly of the non-A1ryans, the Pa1n2d2avas had the support of A1ryans and concludes that the Northern Kurus were Mun2d2ic.^194

10. Licchavis (No. 1, L. 29; No. 4, L. 7; No. 10, L. 4; No. 12, L. 18; No. 13, L. 3: No. 21, L. 5; No. 40, L. 4; No. 47, L. 2; No. 49, L. 2; No. 50, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2): The epithet ‘Licchavi-dauhitra’ (daughter's son of the Licchavi) for Samudragupta occurs in all these Gupta records It suggests the importance of Candragupta I's marriage with the Licchavi princess Kuma1radevi1. The alliance had no social importance but it was important for political gain by virtue of which Candragupta I (Samudragupta's father) gained powerful position in Magadha and the neighbouring countries. In the Candragupta-Kuma1radevi1-coins, we have no mention of the Guptas but only of the Licchavis in plural ‘Licchavayah2’ (the Licchavis). This supports the amalgamation of the Guptas with the Licchavis and we may agree with Majumdar that ‘the epithet Licchavi dauhitra was deliberately given to Samudragupta to emphasize his right of succession to the dual monarchy’.^195 We also know of a house of the Licchavis at Nepal^196 but the separate reference to Nepal as a tributary province in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta^197 proves that it was different from the Licchavi kingdom which Samudragupta had inherited from his mother. The Licchavi kingdom of  Kuma1radevi1 may be located in North Bihar with Vais4a1li1 (modern Basarh in Muzaffarpur district) as its centre.^198 It was a credit for the astute diplomacy of Candragupta to marry the Licchavi princess as we know, in ancient times, the Licchavis of Vais4a1li1 had been the rivals of the kings of Pa1t2aliputra^199 and that they did not marry outside their area.^200 The name of this powerful people has come to us in many different readings: Licchavi, Lecchavi, Lecchai, Lecchaki, Licchvi, Nicchivi, Lichikki and Lichavi. Of these the Licchavi has been most commonly used in literature.^201 The earliest mention of this people is in Kaut2ilya's Arthas4a1stra,^202 where they are called Licchavis. Here we read that the corporations of Licchivi, Vr2ji, Malla, Madra, Kakura, Kuru, Pan5ca1la and others were ‘ra1jas4abdopaji1vinah2’. It is noteworthy that Kaut2ilya distinguishes the Licchavis from the Vr2jis though some scholars consider them to be one.^203 H. Pandey^204 says that it appears from the Pali suttas that the names Vajji and Licchavi are interchangeable to some extent. But the accounts of Chinese pilgrims point to a different conclusion. Fa-Hien describes the kingdom of Vais4a1li1 where ‘Licchavis’ were the people of the country. He does not mention Vr2ji or Vajji. Hiuen Tsang describes Vais4a1li1 and Vr2ji as two distinct countries, and Watters is inclined to doubt the accuracy of his description of the Vr2ji country.^205 But we know that Vajji was a powerful confederacy of which the Videhas along with the Licchavis, Jn5a1trikas, Ugras, Bhojas and others were the constituent confederate clans (at2t2hakula). Of these the Licchavis and the Videhas were the most important, and the Licchavi Capital Vais4a1li1 was the head-quarter of the confederacy.^206 But Ray Chaudhuri observes: “Vajji was not only the name of the confederacy but also of one of the constituent clans. But the Vajjis like the Licchavis are sometimes associated with the city of Vais4a1li1 which was not only the capital of the Licchavi clan, but also the metropolis of the entire confederacy”.^207 The Licchavi republic was generally called the sam3gha or gan2a of the Vajjis. The Licchavis would not possibly have allowed this name, had they not themselves been Vajjians. In one passage,  the Licchavi Maha1na1ma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is represented as saying, “They (i. e. the Licchavis) will become Vajjians, they will become Vajjians (bhavissanti Vajji bhavissanti Vajji)”! This possibly only means that there was great hope of these Licchavi young men becoming true Vajjians, practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the Buddha, conditions which endured their prosperity, and leading a more cultured life. Thus the Vajji appears to be a more dignified term. It might have originally been given to the tribe which inhabited what is known as Vajjirat2t2ha (Vr2ji-ra1s2t2ra), i. e., the Vajjian country, in Buddhist literature. Later a separation seems to have taken place among the Vajjis and Licchavis, because the Arthas4a1stra (XI. I) mentions the Licchavika and the Vr2jika as two distinct republics.^208 The clan of the Licchavis figures very prominently in the annals of early Buddhism. Buddhaghos2a, the celebrated Pali commentator has the following story^209: The chief queen of the king of Benaras, at the time of her child-birth delivered lump of flesh, ‘of the colour of lac and of bandhu and Ji1vaka flowers’. Fearing the displeasure of the king if he should hear of this, the other queens put the lump of flesh into a casket marked with royal seal and placed it on the flowing waters of the Ganges. The casket was discovered by an ascetic, and taken by him to his hermitage, where he cared for the lump of flesh. After the lapse of some time, tha lump broke up into two pieces of flesh, which gradually assumed shape, till finally one of them became a boy resplendent like gold, and the other a girl. Whatever entered the stomach of these two infants looked as if put into a vessel of precious transparent stone (man2i) so that they seemed to have no skin (Nicchavi). Others said: ‘the two were attached to each other by their skin (li1na-chavi) as if they had been sewn together’; so that these infants came to be designated ‘Licchavis’. We are further told that on coming of age the boy and the girl were married to each other and from this brother and sister union sprang the race of the Licchavis^210 The origin of the Licchavis has been a matter of great controversy. They have been represented as Scythians, Kolarians, Tibetans and Persians by different authorities.^211  Samuel Beal^212 takes the Licchavis or Vajjis to be a branch of the ‘Yue-Chi’ forgetting that the latter came to India in the first century B.C. while the Licchavis were a highly civilized and prosperous people in the sixth century B.C. In the opinion of J.P. Hewitt, there are “very strong indications that the Vajjians, who were certainly the earliest settlers in the country, were of Kolarian race who had lived there long before the arrival of the Dravidians and A1ryans”. The learned writer ignores the existence of the pre-Vajjian A1ryan dynasty of rulers at Vais4a1li1.^213 V.A. Smith^214 found similarities between the customs of the Tibetans and those of the Licchavis in the practice of the exposure of the dead and also in judicial procedure. And hence he came to the conclusion that the Licchavis, the ruling tribe or clan in Vr2ji country of which Vais4a1li1 was the capital, was reallya Tibetan (or Mongolian) tribe which settled in the plains during the prehistoric times. The view has been criticised by B.C. Law, K.P. Jayaswal, H.C. Raychaudhuri and others on the following grounds^215: (1) The custom of the disposal of the dead was prevalent among the Vedic A1ryans from whom the Licchavis were descended; (2) In the case of Tibet we have only three courts as against the seven tribunals of the Licchavis; further we know very little about the relative antiquity of the Tibetan procedure which might very well have been suggested by the system expounded in the At2t2hakatha1. S.C. Vidya1bhu1s2an2a^216 suggests a Persian origin for the Licchavis holding that the name Licchavi (Nicchavi of Manu, X. 22) was derived from the Persian city of Nisibis. There is very little in Vidya1bhu1s2an2a's surmise except a fancied resemblance between the names Nicchivi and Nisibis. Inscriptions of the Achaemenids are silent about any Persian settlement in the Eastern India in the sixth or fifth century B.C. The Licchavi people were more interested in Yaks2a caityas and the teaching of Maha1vi1ra and the Buddha than in the deities and Prophets of Iran.^217 The Licchavis have been invariably represented as ks2atriyas in ancient Indian literature. As the Maha1parinibba1n2a-Sutta  informs us, they claimed a share of the remnants of the Buddha's body on the ground that they were ks2atriyas like the Buddha himself: “The Exalted one was a ks2atriya and so are we. We are worthy to receive a portion of relies of the Exalted one”. We get many other similar instances.^218 We find that both the S4a1kyas (to whose race the Buddha belonged) and the Licchavis are described as progenies of brother and sister unions. Like the S4a1kyas, the Licchavis are also described as ks2atriyas.^219 Manu speaks of the Licchavis as ks2atriyas, though of the Vra1tya variety.^220 Regarding the Vra1tyas, Manu says: ‘Those (sons) whom the twice-born have by the wives of equal caste, but who, not fulfilling their scared duties, are excluded from the initiation to Sa1vitri1, one must designate by the appellation vra1tyas’.^221 We know that Maha1vi1ra, the founder of Jainism, was the very kin of the Licchavis and that he had many followers among the residents of Vais4a1li1, even among the highest officers. Then again, between the sixth century B.C. and 200 B.C., the earliest estimated date of the Manusmr2ti,^222 the Licchavis had won the good graces of the Buddha as well as of the followers of the religion he preached. During this long interval, when the two great ‘heretic’ faiths flourished in their country, the Licchavis might not have been particular to the ceremonies and practices that the regulations of the orthodox bra1hman2as required. ‘Hence we can understand how Manu, the great bra1hman2a law-giver came to refer to the Licchavis as Vra1tyas’.^223 But Gokhale^224 takes the term ks2atriya in this context to mean representative of political power rather than a specific caste in the brahminical hierarchy and from the word Vra1tya infers that they were outside the pale of the brahminical civilization. Scholars have divergent views about the connotation of the word ‘Vra1tya’.^225 Charpentier described the Vra1tyas, as a band of people not governed by the rules of caste, probably representing the worst elements of Indian society, -the thief, the robber, the drunken one, etc. But Keith rejected this view by pointing out that Manu's reference to the Ra1janya Vra1tyas, e. g. Licchavis and Mallas (X. 22) has no value for Vedic times.^226 Haver in his article ‘Der Vra1tya’ derives ‘Vra1tya’  from ‘vrata’. Thus the oldest meaning of ‘Vra1ta’ is a group of people bound by holy ceremonies, bound by a vow to cultactions being derived from ‘vrata’ which is a vow taken in the service of a god. The Vra1ti1nas, on the other hand, ‘were Aryans of a more primitive culture and religion, than the orthodox bra1hman2as, and were organised in cult-unions and both ‘vra1tya’ and ‘vra1ti1na’ being derived from ‘vrata’ are ‘members of the same holy union’. The only difference between them apparently was that the Vra1ti1na went to the bra1hman2a countries to perform the Vra1tya-work and were paid for it, while the Vra1tyas acted in their own homeland.^227 From all these considerations, we can see that the views of Manu and the suggestion of B.C. Law are more tenable. In the Nepa1la Vam3s4a1vali1, the Licchavis are allotted to the Su1ryavam3s4a or solar race of the ks2atriyas.^228 This is quite in agreement with the fact elicited from the Buddhist records that they were Va1sis2t2has by Gotra, for we know from the Aitareya Bra1hman2a^229 that the gotra or pravara (family) of a ks2atriya is the same as that of his purohita or family-priest. The Vasis2t2ha gotra was, therefore, the gotra of their family priest, and we know that the Vasis2t2has were the family priests of the kings of the solar race, especially of the Iks2va1kus.^230

11. Madrakas (No. I, L. 22): One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. We also know of Madra as a personal name in No. 15, L. 8. Madras claimed descent from an eponymous king Madraka, son of S4ibi Aus4i1nara, and were septs of the family of S4ivi like the Kaikeyas.^231 According to Dr. Buddha Prakash ‘Bhadra’ was another Variant of Madra.^232 But this view is not acceptable to us. The Maha1bha1rata^233 mentions the Bhadras, but only in the Bombay recension; the Calcutta recension has Madra.^234 We know that Bhadra and Madra had independent existence, as found in the legend of Bhadra1 Ka1ks2i1vati1, bride of Vyus2ita1s4va.^235 The queen had seven children, three S4a1lvas and four Madras. ^236 The Candravr2tti on Candra^237 informs us that Udumbara, Tilakhala, Madraka1ra, Yugandhara, Bhulin3ga and S4aradan2d2a, are the divisions of Sa1lva (or S4a1lva). The word S4a1lva literally  means an animal like stag or gazelle which bespeaks of Scythian origin.^238 Buddha Prakash connects it with the modern sub-caste Saluja (Skt. Sa1lvaja). Anyhow, we know that Madras were a branch of S4a1lvas who were sons of Bhadra. J. Przyluski^239 considers the Madras to have been a section of the Bhadras on the ground that the former had among their ancestress a queen named Bhadra1. Both the Bhadras and the Madrakas are mentioned separately in the Br2hatsam3hita1,^240 the Bhadras with the S4a1lvas in the Madhyades4a (Middle land) and the Madrakas with the Ma1lavas in the northern quarter. Nakula and Sahadeva were the sons of Pa1n2d2u by his wife Ma1dri1. The name of their mother Ma1dri1 suggests their connection with the clan of the Madras.^241 Since Ba1lhiki (Ba1hlika stands for the Bactrians) was the title of Ma1dri1, Madras were of Irano-Bactrian origin; the Madras may represent the Iranian tribe, Ma1da or Mede.^242 The Madras were an ancient ks2atriya tribe.^243 We do not find their mention in the early Vedic Sam3hita1s but the Vam3s4a Bra1hman2a (of the Sa1maveda) tells us of a Vedic teacher named Madra-ga1ra S4aun3ga1yani (‘descendant of S4un3ga’) whose pupil was Ka1mboja Aupamanyava.^244 Zimmer^245 concludes, with probability, that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas and the Madras. We know from the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a^246 that the Madra country was the chief centre of Vedic learning. We know of a Ka1pya Patan5cala amongst the Madras who was a famous teacher of Vedic lore.^247 The Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras’ are referred to in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a^248 as living beyond the Himalaya (paren2a himavantam) in the neighbourhood of the Uttara Kurus, probably, as Zimmer^249 conjectures, in the land of Kashmira. The Madras mentioned in the Upanis2ads were, like the Kurus, probably settled somewhere in Kurukshetra in the Madhyades4a or ‘Middle Land’.^250 Pa1n2ini^251 mentions two divisions of the Madras, Pu1rva (eastern) and Apara (Western). In the Br2hatsam3hita1 they are mentioned twice; firstly as Madra situated in West in Va1yavya Kon2a,^252 and secondly as Madraka with Ma1lava in the North.^253 In the Ra1ma1yan2a, we read that Sugri1va sent monkeys to  the Madrakas and other tribes in quest of Si1ta1.^254 The Madra tribe or kingdom^255 is mentioned in the Bhi1s2maparvan of the Maha1bha1rata (chap. IX) and in Pa1n2ini's grammar (II, 3, 73; IV, 4, 67). The Madras held the Central portions of the Punjab;^256 they appear in the Epic period to have occupied the district of Sialkot, between the rivers Chenab and Ravi,^257 or according to some between the Jhelum and the Ravi.^258 S.B. Chaudhuri^259 says that the Madras held the portion in the Doab between the Chenab and the Ravi, possibly comprising even a portion of the country between the Jhelum and the Chenab, and thus abutted on Kaikeya on the West. We get a clue to the inhabitance of the Madras from a verse in the Karn2aparvan of the Maha1bha1rata^260 which refers to a Madra, who had come to live among the Kurus, as yearning for his return to his native place beyond the S4atadru and the Ira1vati1 to enjoy the company of charming women. S4a1kala (Pali-Sagala, modern Sialkot) was the capital of the Madras identified^261 with Sanglawala-Tiba, to the West of the Ravi. From the Milinda-pan5ho, we learn that king Milinda (Menander) a Graeco-Bactrian king, who became a convert to Buddhism, was ruling over the Madda country with Sagala as his capital which according to a Buddhist lexicon, was one of the twenty ancient cities.^262 The brahminical name^263 of the Madra Capital was S4a1kala mentioned by Pa1n2ini^264 as Sa1nkala. In the Maha1bha1rata^265 and the Ja1takas^266 S4a1kala is described as standing on the bank of the A1paga1 in a tongue of land between two rivers, called the S4a1kaladvi1pa, which corresponds to the Rechna Doab. We know from the Maha1bha1rata about S4alya, king of the Madras (Madrara1ja). ^267 After severe fighting, and many vicissitudes, the Madra soldiers were killed by Arjuna.^268 The Madras are mentioned in the Pura1n2as as well.^269 The Vis2n2u Pura1n2a^270 refers to the Madras along with the A1ra1mas, Pa1rasi1kas, and others and in the Matsya Pura1n2a^271 with Ga1ndha1ra, Yavana and others. The latter^272 mentions king As4vapati of S4a1kala in the kingdom of the Madras. The Madras, according to the Arthas4a1stra of Kaut2ilya^273 were a corporation of warriors and people enjoyed the title of ra1jan (ra1jas4abdopaji1vinah2).^274  Madra women were noted for their beauty. ^275 The Ja1takas bear ample testimony to the fact that the Madra princesses were sought in marriage by the great ks2atriya house of North India.^276 The Maha1bha1rata tells us that it was a family custom of the Madras to receive a fee from the bridegroom when they gave their daughters in marriage.^277 Some scholars identify the Madras with Va1hlika (or Va1hi1ka).^278 S4a1kala as a Va1hi1kagra1ma is also mentioned by Patan5jali.^279 From the references in the Maha1bha1rata, Va1hi1ka would appear to have stood for the whole of Punjab.^280 The Va1hi1ka-gra1mas of S4a1kala and Pa1tanaprastha, as referred to in the grammatical works,^281 imply the inclusion of Madrajanapada in the Va1hi1ka country. The Madras are known as low, barbarous^282 and sinful people.^283 They are mentioned as base, impure and contemptible.^284 “Amongst the Madrakas all acts of friendship are lost”^285 and so it is said: “Neither one should create enmity, nor friendship with a Madraka”.^286 The Ra1jataran3gin2i1 also records similar views.^287 But the advent of the Jarttikas or Jartas (modern Ja1t2s) who spread over the whole of Punjab was responsible for the degeneration of the Madras.^288 The legend of Sa1vitri1 and Satyavan is connected with the Madra country, for Sa1vitri1 was the daughter of As4vapati, king of Madra.^289 In the Udyogaparvan the camp of S4alya is described as full of warriors, whose strange armours, bows and banners, unfamiliar trappings, vehicles and equipment and local costumes, ornaments and deportment presented a unique spectacle in the country of the Kurus. ^290 In the early part of the sixth century A.D. the Madra country passed under the rule of the Hu1n2a conqueror Mihirakula (A.D. 515-535) who ruled from Sialkot. The Madras continued to flourish even up to the time of the Pa1la king Dharmapa1la in the 9th century A.D.^291

12. Ma1lava (No. 1, L. 22; No. 17, L. 19; No. 32, L. 11): We know Ma1lava as a tribe which was subjugated along with some other tribes by Samudragupta (No. 1). No. 17 refers to the Ma1lava-gan2a^292 which has been translated by Fleet as ‘the tribal constitution of the Ma1lavas’ in the sense of the event of some formal establishment of the Ma1lavas’ as a tribe.^293 Fleet fixes  it up as 57-56 B.C.^294 Thomas^295 translates the expression as “the continuance (sthiti) of the tribal constitution (gan2a) of the Ma1lavas” and adds “It was to gan2a-sthiti, not to gan2a, that I gave the meaning of ‘tribal constitution’; and I did not introduce the idea of ‘Continuance’.” My amended translation is “the usage of the Ma1lava tribe.”^296 Thus the expression ‘Ma1lava1na1m gan2a’ refers to the Ma1lavas as a tribe. No. 32 speaks of the Ma1lava-vam3s4a which has been translated as ‘the race of the Ma1lavas,^297 but it would be better to translate it as “the dynasty of the Ma1lavas”.^298 It seems that this tribe had established independent rulership and so we find the word ‘vam3s4a’ used where the word ‘gan2a’ could also be used^299 Dr. Buddha Prakash holds that Madras and Ma1lavas were the same, in Prakrit Madra becomes Malla, as ‘dra’ is changed into ‘ll’. He identifies Malla with the Malloi of the Greeks and Ma1lava of the Epic. He points out that the sons of As4vapati, king of the Madras, were called Ma1lavas after their mother, according to decree of Yama which shows that Madra and Ma1lava were identical.^300 But we venture to disagree with the learned scholar. The Br2hatsam3hita1 mentions Madraka and Ma1lava separately but side by side as people of the North.^301 At the time of Samudragupta, the Ma1lavas possibly lived in Rajasthan and West Malwa^302 consisting of Mewar, Tonk and adjoining regions of south-east Rajasthan.^303 They setteled in various localities in Western India after having migrated from the Punjab where they had fought with Alexander on the lower banks of Ravi.^304 Their original home was in Jhang District, Punjab. ^305 Subsequently they became the inhabitants of Malwa and the Vikrama era derived its original appellation from them.^306 That the Ma1lavas had migrated to the Jaipur region (Rajasthan) from the Punjab is supported by the fact that the legend on some Ma1lava coins found in Rajasthan reads from right to left as in Kharos2t2hi1, which was prevalent in the Punjab and the north-west from very early times.^307 The Sikhs of Ferozpur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Jind and Malerkotala are still known as Ma1lava Sikhs, probably, because these regions were populated by the Ma1lavas in ancient times.^308 Ma1lava and Ma1lavaka are also to be differentiated, the former is  Ma1lava proper while the latter is lesser Ma1lava with the diminutive suffix ‘ka’.^309 Ma1lava is the same as Malloi of the Greeks.^310 Pa1n2ini does not mention them by name, but his su1tra, V. 3. 117 speaks of ‘a1yudhaji1vi1 sam3ghas’, or tribes living by the profession of arms, and the Ka1s4ika1 says that amongst these sam3ghas were the Ma1lavas and Ks2udrakas.^311 The Ma1lava tribe is actually mentioned in the Maha1bhas2ya of Patan5jali.^312 The Maha1bha1rata couples the Ma1lavas with the Trigarttas,^313 as well as with the S4ivis and Ambas2t2has.^314 But soon they migrated southwards and settled somewhere in Rajasthan where we find them at the time of Samudragupta.^315 Many coins found at Nagar, 45 miles north of Kota, have the legend. “Ma1lava1na1m jayah2” (victory of the Ma1lavas) in letters belonging to the period from 250 B.C. to A.D. 250. According to Cunningham these coins show that the existence of the Ma1lavas as a recognised and important clan, long before their tribal constitution led to the establishment of their era.^316 The Ma1lavas came into conflict with Nahapa1na's son-in-law Us2avada1ta who subdued them.^317 According to the Pura1n2as^318 the Ma1lavas are associated with the Saura1s2t2ras, Avantis, A1bhi1ras, S4u1ras, and Arbudas, dwell along the Pariya1tra mountains. Thus they seem to have occupied other territories besides the Punjab or Rajasthan. Pargiter points out that even according to the Pura1n2as the Ma1lavas lived in a ‘mountanious’ country, and were nowhere near present Malwa. Ma1lava king were taken as vra1tya and mostly s4u1dra in the Pura1n2as.^319 The Bhi1s2maparvan of the Maha1bha1rata mentions the western (prati1cya) and northern (udi1cya) sections of the Ma1lavas.^320 But the Ra1ma1yan2a locates the Ma1lavas in the east. ^321 Ka1masu1tra's commentator Jayaman3gala, who flourished later than the fourteenth century, says that A1vantika, which is identical with Ujjayini1-des4a, is apara-Ma1lava.^322 This has led some writers to suggest that Ma1lava proper is Das4a1rn2a. But Jayaman3gala's geographical knowledge was not perfect.^323 His remark on Ma1lava is to be rejected as it runs counter to earlier authorities. Ra1jas4ekhara mentions Ma1lava, Avanti and Vidis4a1 and the Man5ju1s4ri1 mentions Ma1lava, Vidis4a1 and Das4a1rn2a side  by side^324 Modern Malwa is the region around Ujjayini1 and Bhilsa. The influence of the Ma1lavas in the Mandasor region is proved by the fact that they could impose their tribal era upon the Mandasor princes.^325 An inscription describes the subjugation of Sapta-Ma1lava by Dan2d2ana1yaka Anantapa1la, a feudatory of Vikrama1ditya VI.^326 The Hars2acarita of Ba1n2a refers to the ‘wicked Ma1lava king’ generally identified with Devagupta, who killed Grahavarman Maukhari, but was himself defeated by Ra1jyavardhana. B.C. Law places the kingdom of Devagupta between Praya1ga and Bhilsa which is identical with Pu1rva-Ma1lava.^327 Thus the Ma1lavas originally belonged to Jhang District in Punjab (now in Pakistan), from where they spread all over Punjab and by the time of Samudragupta had migrated to Rajasthan. The Ma1lavas had emerged in 250 B.C. as an independent tribal state. But they came under the subservience of the S4akas in the Ist century B.C., to the western ks2atraps from the 2nd to the 4th centuries A.D. and to Samudragupta in the 4th century A.D., but this typical native state exerted itself again.^328 In the period after about A.D. 550 they seem to have migrated further to the east and covered the region from Bhilsa (Eastern Malwa) to Praya1ga.^329 During the rule of the Pa1las of Bengal they seem to have migrated still further east; for the copper plates of the Pa1la kings (excepting Dharmapa1la), refer to the Ma1lavas as mercenary troops in their army.^330 The name of the tribe survives in the modern province of Malwa (a transformation of the word Ma1lava), and in the bra1hman2a castes called ‘Ma1lavi1s’ or ‘Ma1lavikas’. They are the bra1hman2as of Ma1lava proper and the adjoining country, but are found also in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.^331

13. Mleccha (No. 14, L. 4): According to Sircar^332 Fleet conjectures the reading to be Mleccha. The last few letters in line 4 after ‘ni’ are not legible. So how Fleet could take this reading without putting any doubt is really surprising. Mlecchas were amongst the enemies defeated by Skandagupta in this inscription (No. 14). The war with the Mlecchas probably refers to his fight with the Hu1n2as which is specifically referred to in the Bhitari Pillar Inscription. Whether the Mlecchas are the same as Hu1n2as or were a  different tribe, both the records (No. 13, No. 14) claim that Skandagupta completely defeated these enemies.^333 The fact that in both the inscriptions, the reference to the fight with the Hu1n2as and Mlecchas is preceded by a reference to the falling fortunes of the family supports the identification. We also find a reference to the oppression of the earth by the Mlecchas in the epilogue of the play Mudra1-Ra1ks2asa written by Vis2a1khadatta where it is prayed that ‘The earth may now be protected by “His Highness” along with relatives and retinue by king Candragupta’. It is probable that the play was written after the Ra1magupta episode and probably the word Mleccha in this context alludes to the S4akas who were suppressed by Candragupta II in the guise of the Gupta queen Dhruvasva1mini1. D.C. Sircar^334 is of the view that Mleccha is the name applied to the Muhammadans and other foreigners. In the Sanskrit language originally there does not appear to have been any general term for a foreigner. But as the Da1sa, Dasyu, Barbara, and Mleccha became more or less absorbed in A1ryan civilization and the original specific meaning of these terms was no longer remembered, these words came to be used for any foreigner.^335 The word Mleccha was used to refer to both the eastern and western A1navas. In course of time it came to be used for almost any non-A1ryan and even for A1ryans of impure speech. Subsequently the term meant something like “foreigner”, but that was after most of the A1navas had become assimilated.^336 When not used in association with the foreigners the word Mleccha is used for one who is impure, dirty or uncultured. It is derived from the root §mlich~mlech,^337 meaning to speak indistinctly (like a foreigner or barbarian who does not speak Sanskrit). We find the use of root in Maha1bha1s2ya.^338 The Sanskrit term Mleccha, referring to the indistinct speech of some non-A1ryans, is taken from proto-Bodish (protoTibetan) mlts4e “tongue”, Old Bodish lts4e, Kukish generally mlei, the combination of initial consonants (mlts4 -) being simplified in various ways in different Tibeto-Burmic languages. Aspiration cannot occur after I in old Bodish; and the protoBodish form may have been mltse for all we know, so the ‘cch’ of Sanskrit “Mleccha may come nearer the primitive affricate  than anything preserved in the Tibeto-Burmic languages. Since ‘mleche’ would be an impossible combination in Sanskrit, mleccha would be as close as a Sanskrit speaker could come to it”.^339 Mleccha^340 occurs in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a^341 in the sense of a barbarian in speech. Here the bra1hman2as are forbidden to use barbarian speech. The example^342 given of such speech is “he' layo”, explained by Sa1yan2a as “he' rayah2”, “ho, foes”. The barbarians referred to were A1ryan speakers, though not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Prakrit form of speach.^343 An ancient tradition regards the Andhras, Pulindas and S4abaras as dog-eaters or Mlecchas.^344 The Jain Prajn5a1pana1 records two divisions of the people of India -Milikkha and A1rya, and enumerates 53 people in the former group, some of which are the Saga, Javana, Sabara, Vavvara, Hon2a, Romaya, Pa1rasa and Khasa.^345 The Maha1bha1rata^346 states that the Mlecchas dwelt in the Yavana, Ci1na and Kamboja countries. In a dual between Karn2a and S4alya, Karn2a highly condemns the people of the Va1hi1ka and especially of the Madra Country and describes them as the Mleccha, the dirt among the human beings.^347 They belong to unpious countries and are totally ignorant about the Dharma (righteous conduct).^348 At another place, it is stated that the Yavanas are the Mlecchas, though they follow their own ways (i. e. not following the Vedic Orthodoxy) yet they are full of knowledge and brave but the Va1hi1kas and the Madras are condemned as utterly foolish.^349 This makes it clear that the people not following the righteous conduct according to the A1ryan beliefs, whether indigenous or foreign, were labelled as the Mlecchas. The Maha1bha1rata^350 shows that the coastal regions were the favourite resort of the Mlecchas and that they were dreadful. The Epic describes the Mlecchas as being impure because they were of bovine extraction and describes them as fierce and cruel.^351 In the Manu-Smr2ti^352 the king is advised to exclude at deliberation time, the foolish, dumb, blind, and deaf, birds, the aged, women; the Mlecchas (the impure), diseased and deformed. At another place in the Manu-Smr2ti where the girls bearing the names after a star, a tree, (or) a river, one called  after the Antyas or a mountain, one called after a bird, snake, or slave or with a terrifying name are forbidden for marriage, Kullu1ka, the commentator on Manu explains the word Antya as representing the Mlecchas.^353 From the Manu^354 it is clear that the Mlecchas spoke a different language than the A1ryans. The Va1yu, Matsya and Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2as state that the seven Himalayan rivers pass through the Mleccha countries.^355 In the Vara1ha Pura1n2a, a place named Loha1rgala is stated to be ruled over by the Mleccha kings.^356 The Amara-kos4a^357 describes the Kira1tas, S4abaras and Pulindas as the Mlecchaja1tis. The Br2hat-Sam3hita1^358 places them in the West and describes them as unrighteous. It places them under the jurisdiction of Man3gala graha^359 and assigns them the region of Ra1hu graha, inhabiting the mountain-tops, low-regions or the caves.^360 In the ‘life’ of Hiuen Tsang, all places to the north of Lamgham district have been described as Mi-li-ku, i. e. frontier or Mleccha lands.^361 In the A1rya-man5ju1s4ri1-Mu1la-kalpa, the Mlecchas frequently appear as the companions of robbers.^362 In the Katha1saritSa1gara,^363 the Mlecchas are connected with Sindh. They are stated to have killed bra1hman2as, interfered with sacrifices, and carried off the daughters of hermits.^364 The Ra1jataran3gin2i1^365 mentions the Mlecchas as issuing forth from the valleys adjoining the Himalayas. In medieval inscriptions, the name Mleccha has been applied indiscriminately to all foreigners.^366 The Mleccha army of the Gwalior Pras4asti of Bhoja consisted of the Arabs.^367 The Mlecchas of the inscriptions of the medieval period refer to Muhammadans and the people of Baluchistan.^368 The Siddha1nta-Kaumudi1^369 describes the Ks2udhunas as the Mlecchas. In the S4aktisan3gama Tantra (a work of the 17th century), we get reference to the Mleccha (verse 24), Maha1mleccha (verses 28, 30) and Mleccha-ma1rga (verse 31) where they are mentioned along with Pa1n5ca1la, Ka1mboja and Ba1hli1ka and the Khura1s4an country is described as the Mleccha-ma1rga.^370

14. Murun2d2as (No. 1, L. 23): Murun2d2a is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta along with the terms Daivaputra, S2a1hi S2a1ha1nus2a1hi and S4aka as one compound expression.^371 Fleet takes  S4akas and Murun2d2as as two separate tribes. They were one of the foreign potentates who came of their own accord to offer allegiance to Samudragupta. According to Sten Konow ‘murun2d2a’ is the later form of a S4aka word meaning ‘lord’ or ‘master’. The term ‘S4akaMurun2d2a’ therefore possibly stands for those S4aka lords or chieftains who were ruling in the regions of Sura1s2t2ra and Ujjain at the time of Samudragupta.^372 But we find in the Khoh plates of Maha1ra1ja Sarvana1tha the names ‘Murun2d2adevi1’^373 and Murun2d2asva1mini1^374 which shows that Murun2d2a was the name of a tribe and not a title. On the basis of Khoh plates, Smith^375 suggested that “the Murun2d2as may possibly have been settled in the hill country of Riwa along the Kaimur range or more probably further south in the Vindhya or north Dekkan or possibly in the Chhotanagpur”. According to R.K. Mookerji,^376 the people called here as the Murun2d2as are to be distinguished from the S4akas and may be identified with the Kus2a1n2as, as earlier suggested by Sten Konow.^377 We know that the term Daivaputra in the inscription has been used to refer to the Kus2a1n2a kings, and S4akas are mentioned separately. So we cannot equate Murun2d2as with the Kus2a1n2as as suggested by R.K. Mookerji. Some scholars regard Murun2d2a as the name of a powerful foreign tribe, ruling in the upper Ganges valley.^378 According to the Chinese authority, the Capital of Meou-lun (a word equated with Murun2d2a) was 7,000 li from the mouth of the Great River, which was undoubtedly the Ganges. Allan is, therefore, not right in suggesting that the Chinese description of the capital refers to Pa1t2aliputra.^379 Jayaswal took S4akaMurun2d2a to denote the smaller S4aka rulers like the ‘Shalada, Shaka and the Gadahara chiefs as well as the Western Satraps’.^380 In the Abhidha1na-Cinta1man2i^381 and the Vaijayanti1^382 the Lampa1kas are identified with Murun2d2as. The Lampa1kas are the same as the Lambatai of Ptolemy.^383 The Pura1n2as,^384 mention Lampa1kas, the people who were residing in Lampa1ka, the modern Laghman in Afghanistan. Ra1jas4ekhara seems to be  referring to Lampa1ka as Limpaka.^385 The Murun2d2as seem to be a foreign tribe. Murun2d2a is clearly a non-A1ryan word and can have no A1ryan derivation.^386 Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) mentions the Murun2d2as for the first time under the name Moroundai and places them on the western border of the ‘Gangaridai’. They seem to have occupied an extensive territory, probably the whole of North-Bihar on the east of the Gan3ga1, as far as the head of the delta. They had six important cities, all to the east of the Gan3ga1: Boraita, Koryagaza, Kondota, Kelydna, Aganegora and Talarga. These places are difficult to identify but to Saint-Martin Kelydna appeared to have some relation with Ka1linadi1 or Ka1lindi1 river, and Aganagora with Aghadip (Agradvi1pa) on the eastern bank of the Ganges, a little below Katwa.^387 According to Cunningham, the name of the Marundai is still preserved in the country of the Mun2d2as, a hill tribe scattered over Chhota-Nagpur and Central India.^388 But M.S. Pandey^389 opposes the view on the ground that the Murun2d2as dwelt in the north-west with other foreign tribes. The evidence is strong enough to show that the Murun2d2as had not spread so far to the east as to occupy the Chhota-Nagpur region. However, barbarous and pastoral the Murun2d2as might have been before their immigration into India, when they held the sceptre in their hands they must have been endowed with the quality and capacity to rule over a people who were highly civilized. Such a race could hardly have sunk to a position so low as that of the Mun2d2as of the modern times. Moreover, the Mun2d2as are a dominant division of the aboriginals of the Chhota-Nagpur region. Had they been the descendants of the Murun2d2as, we should have found them in other parts of Central India also, and not confined to this small region so far from their place of origin.^390 M.S. Pandey^391 disagrees with the Puranic account on the basis that many discrepancies have crept in owing to the mistakes of the copyists.

15. Pra1rju1nas (No. 1, L. 22): A tribe subdued by Samudragupta who are said to have obeyed his imperial commands and paid all kinds of taxes. Vincent Smith^392 places the Pra1rju1nas in the Narasim3hapur district of  the Central Provinces, but a more plausible location is Narasim3hagarh in Central India,^393 as much as three other tribes which are coupled with Pra1rju1nas, the Sanaka1ni1kas, Ka1kas and Kharaparikas, seem to have occupied regions more or less within the bounds of Central India^394 The tribe, associated with the name of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and north-west before the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.^395 Kaut2ilya knows of a people called Pra1jjunaka (Pra1rjunaka).^396

16. Pus2yamitras (No. 13, L. 11): The Bhitari Stone Pillar Inscription^397 records Skandagupta's victory over a powerful enemy called the Pus2yamitras, who possessed a strong army and a rich treasury: he (Skandagupta) placed (his) left foot on a foot-stool which was the king (of that tribe himself).^398 H.R. Divekar suggested the reading Yudhy-amitra1n in place of Pus2yamitra1n. But, as pointed out by R.D. Banerji,^399 the proposed reading is impossible. There are several views about the identification of the Pus2yamitras. (i) Fleet identified them with the people mentioned in the Pura1n2as as Pat2umitras and located them on the Narmada1.^400 (ii) V.A. Smith^401 regarded them as a people of the North. (iii) Hoernle believed that they were the same as the Maitrakas.^402 (iv) R.D. Banerji^403 regarded them as the first wave of the Hu1n2as. (v) N.K. Bhattasali has suggested that the Pus2yamitras were the descendants of king Pus2yavarma1 of Assam.^404 Bhattasali says that a pun (s4les2a) has been used for “the descendants of Pus2yavarman of Assam who had so long been mitras or friends of the Guptas, but had change into foes by their desire for conquest and had invaded the Gupta empire from the east and made it totter”. But as remarked by D.C. Sircar, “there is no grammatical, lexicographical, or literary support, for this interpretation of the name Pus2yamitra”.^405 Bhattasali opines that Mahendravarman, whom he assigns to the period A.D. 450 to 490 who performed two horse-sacrifices must have been powerful enough to launch an attack on the Gupta empire in the reign of Skandagupta.  We know that the definite limits of Skandagupta's reign are from A.D. 455 to 467. The period of the rule of Mahendravarman, however, cannot be so definitely fixed because we do not possess any dated records of his reign. As a matter of fact the entire chronology of the kings of Assam can be settled approximately only by means of synchronisms and rough calculations. The attack on the Gupta empire by the Varmans of Assam in the reign of Skandagupta is an impossibility.^406 The Pus2yamitras cannot be a branch of the Hu1n2as as held by R.D. Banerji. The Hu1n2as have been mentioned separately in the Bhitari Inscription.^407 “By whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict with the Hu1n2as”. Hoernle's view that “the Pus2yamitras were the same as Maitrakas who some years later under the leadership of Bhat2a1rka established themselves in Valabhi1 probably with the help of the Hu1n2a ruler Torama1n2a”;^408 is also not acceptable as the Maitrakas remained subservient to the Imperial Guptas from the time of Bhat2a1rka to that of Dron2asim3ha.^409 Therefore, they cannot be the same as Pus2yamitras who rebelled against Skandagupta. The Pura1n2as mention a people called Pus2yamitras, whose rule commenced after the end of the dynasty of the Vindhyakas. In the Vis2n2upura1n2a MSS. consulted by Prof. Wilson we have the following statement: “and Pus2pamitras, and Pat2umitras and others to the number of thirteen will rule over Mekala1”.^410 Prof. Wilson has added the following note, “It seems most correct to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya princes from these Ba1hlikas and then from the Pus2yamitras and Pat2umitras who governed Mekala1, a country on the Narmada1”.^411 A similar statement is to be found in the Va1yupura1n2a, according to which ‘the Pus2yamitras and Pat2umitras are grouped with the rulers of Mekala1, whose seven kings have not been named.^412 The mention of Vindhyakas, evidently a people of the Vindhya region, and of Mekala1, points to the south rather than to North. So the view of V.A. Smith that the Pus2yamitras were a people of the North is not acceptable.  Thus the view of Fleet that the Pus2yamitras are to be placed in Central India somewhere in the country along the banks of the Narmada1, seems to be most reasonable.^413 This is supported by numismatic evidence, a hoard of coins brought to light by D.B. Diskalkar,^414 from the village of Bamnala, 24 miles to the south of the Narmada1, indicates that there was a serious disturbance of peace in the vicinity of Mekala1, in the middle of the fifth century A.D. and we may connect it with the rising of the Pus2yamitras in that region.^415

17. Sa1ha1nus2a1hi^416 (No. 1, L. 23): S2a1ha1nus2a1his are also mentioned to have paid homage to Samudragupta along with other tribes. The S2a1ha1nus2a1his are to be identified with the Sassanids or the Sassanian kings. The title ‘Sa1ha1nus2a1hi (s4aha1n-s4a1h) has frequently been used by the Sassanian kings.^417 The contemporary Sassanian emperor was Shahpur II (A.D. 309-379).^418 The Sassanians are known to have been the rulers of Persia from A.D. 211 to 651.^419 According to tradition the dynasty is named after its founder Sassan. His son and successor Papaka, seized power by a coup d'etat against his suzerain, the Parthian king and his accession was the starting point for a new cra (A.D. 208).^420 Goyal^421 confuses the Sassanians with the Pa1rasi1kas of Ka1lida1sa. But they were different from the Pa1rasi1kas. The Sassanians had founded a powerful kingdom in Persia, but they had not yet conquered the whole of Persia.^422 The Pa1rasi1kas of Ka1lida1sa were the S2a1his.^423 Though the possibility of a Kus2a1n2a-Sassanian coalition may not be ruled out it seems that at the time of Samudragupta,^424 three kings the Daivaputra (the Kus2a1n2as), the S2a1hi (the Persians or the Pa1rasi1kas of Ka1lida1sa), and the S2a1ha1nus2a1hi (the Sassanians) were ruling independently.^425 Buddha Prakash^426 traces the Khatri sub-castes Sahni and Osahan as the remnants of the title ‘S2a1ha1nus2a1hi’. But this is far-fetched. So far as Sahni is concerned it is to be connected with Sa1dhanika the name of an officer in the administration of the early medieval period.^427 It may be noted that the Sassanian title S4ahan-S4a1h was used for the Great Emperor in Mughal period, which usage continues. In popular parlance the term is used for calling or  receiving some person respectively.

18. S2a1hi^428 (No. 1, L. 23): The S2a1his are said to have paid homage to Samudragupta. From the appendix it is clear that Daivaputra is not an adjective of S2a1hi as Goyal^429 has surmised and has identified it with Kida1ra Kus2a1n2a of the Great Kus2a1n2a family. Daivaputras have been interpreted to denote the Kus2a1n2as; so S2a1his cannot be identified with the Kus2a1n2as. They must have been an independent and separate tribe, and may be identified with the Persians mentioned in the Raghuvam3s4a in connexion with the North-Westren conquests of Raghu.^430 Goyal^431 identifies the Sassanians with the Pa1rasi1kas of Ka1lida1sa. But Pa1rasi1kas can never be identified with Sassanians. The word ‘Pa1rasi1kas’ itself clearly be speaks of the Persians and is identical with the modern Parasis. Moreover, S2a1ha1nus2a1his are to be identified with the Sassanians whereas S2a1his refer to the Persians. Even now the king of Persia (Iran) is known as ‘Sha1h of Iran’. S2a1hi is an Iranian or Persian word and seems to have some relation with Sanskrit root §s4a1s to rule, which when formed a noun means ‘a ruler’. ^432 The S4a1hi dynasty of Kabul was ousted by the bra1hman2a minister of the last king. The new dynasty was also known as the S4a1his and has been mentioned by Al-Beruni and Kalhan2a. The word S4a1ha or Sa1hu, often used for banias in villages, is not connected with S2a1hi or S4a1hi but is to be derived from Sanskrit ‘sa1dhu’.^433

19. Saim3halaka (No. 1, L. 23): Inhabitants of Sim3hala or Ceylon. They are mentioned along with the Daivaputras, S2a1his, S2a1ha1nus2a1his, S4akas and Murun2d2as, and all (other) dwellers in islands (probably the islands of Southern Sea such as Ja1va1 and Suma1tra1)^434 who paid homage to Samudragupta by offering themselves for services, bringing presents of maidens, praying for charters bearing the imperial Gupta Garud2a seal (Garutmadan3ka) by which they would be left undisturbed by the emperor in the enjoyment (bhukti) and administration (s4a1sana) of their respective territories.^435 If literally interpreted the inscription will suggest that the people mentioned here were really tributaries under Samudragupta.  When we see from the inscription itself that the Tamil states were left undisturbed, the inclusion of even distant Sim3hala (Ceylon) and all other islands in this category raises great doubts about this interpretation, and we shall hardly be justified in taking the words of the Court-poet in their literal sense without corroborative evidence.^436 But the question arises that was the conquest of Ta1mraparn2i1 (Sim3hala) by As4oka in his Rock Edict II also a simple boast of this kind?^437 So far as Ceylon is concerned, we have fortunately an independent evidence of its political relation with Samudagupta. We know that after the death of king Maha1sena (A.D. 334 -62) of the Lambakarn2a clan his son Sumeghavarn2a (chi-mi-kiapo-mo = “cloud of merit”) became king of Ceylon who was a contemporary of Samudragupta (San-meou-to-lo-kin-to).^438 He, according to a Chinese text, sent two monks to Bodh-Gaya1 to visit the sacred spots, but they were put to great inconvenience for want of suitable accommodation. To remove this difficulty for future pilgrims to the holy place, Meghavarn2a decided to found a monastery there. He accordingly sent a mission to Samudragupta with rich presents and asked for permission, and the Ceylonese king built a splendid monastery to the north of the Bodhi tree.^439 By the time of Hiuen Tsang it had developed into a magnificant establishment, with more than 1,000 priests, and the pilgrim has described the rich decorations and massive grandeur of the buildings. Referring to the old history of its foundation Hiuen Tsang says that the Ceylonese king ‘gave in tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country’. “It is likely that Samudragupta's courtier also regarded the rich presents as a tribute, and construed the Ceylonese king's prayer for permission to build a monastery into an ‘application for charter confirming him in the enjoyment of his territories’, one of the forms of homage paid by the category of states into which Sim3hala is included”.^440 Sim3hala is generally identified with Lan3ka1. But Vara1hamihira^441 mentions both of them separately as situated in the South. Lan3ka1 has been identified differently by various scholars with Lan3ka1 of Madhyades4a,^442 with Maldives,^443 with the  northern part of the Andhra country on the shores of the Bay of Bengal,^444 and with an island off the south-east Coast of Ceylon.^445 All these theories are refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri^446 who remarks that the assumption that Lan3ka1 is not Ceylon is gratuitous.^447 He points out that in the Ra1ma1yan2a Ra1van2a while entreating Si1ta1 to be his wife says: “Lan3ka1na1ma samudrasya madhye mama maha1puri1 sa1garen2a pariks2ipta1 nivis2t2a1... ”^448 Hanuman makes a similar statement in describing the strategical position of Lan3ka1: Sthita1 pa1re samudrasya du1rapa1rasya.^449 Ka1lida1sa in his Raghuvam3s4a in connexion with ‘Puri1m Lan3ka1m’ writes: “Maha1rn2ava pariks2epam lanka1ya1h2 parikha1laghum”.^450 With regard to the bridge built by Ra1ma Ka1lida1sa notes: sa setum3 bandhaya1ma1sa plavan3gairlavan2a1mbhasi.^451 In the Skanda Pura1n2a^452 and in the Katha1saritsa1gara, we have similar references to Lan2ka1.^453 All these passages point distinctly to the great sea on the other side of which was situated the great city of Lan3ka1. The separate mention of Sim3hala and Lan3ka1 in many Sanskrit texts is quoted to show that Lan3ka1 was distinct from Ceylon.^454 This is hardly convincing for the separate mention of Mathura1 and S4u1rasena, Sa1keta and Kosala, Ga1ndha1ra and Taks2as4ila1, Avanti and Ujjaini1, did not imply any material geographical difference as they were treated only as convertible terms in geographical texts of the Pura1n2as. In the Puranic lists, Lan2ka1 is a territorial name and Sim3hala is an ethnic name. As the name of a city in the island of Sim3hala, Lan3ka1 passed off as a dvi1pa, and the two names were used in the same geographical sense. A passage in the Ra1ma1yan3a runs thus: “Sim3hala1n barbara1n mleccha1n ye ca lan3ka1niva1sinah2”.^455 Hiuen Tsang also mentions Seng-ka-lo (Ceylon) which included Leugka (Lan3ka1).^456 As pointed out by B.C. Law, the Maha1vam3s4a and its commentary show that Lan3ka1dvi1pa (the lower portion) was one of the main divisions of the island of Ceylon.^457 It is a valid presumption, therefore, that the ancient name Lan3ka1 referred to Ceylon.^458 We may assume further, as seems very likely, that Lan3ka1 was the early name of Ceylon and its literary name as well. Mention is made of Lan3ka1dvi1pa even in medieval inscriptions.^459 The Madras museum plates of Jat2ilavarman refer to the beautiful island of Lan3ka1 as Ilangai.^460 Epigraphic evidence, however, shows that Sim3hala, another name  of ancient Ceylon, was equally well known. Thus the Kanhad plate of Kr2s2n2a III refers to the island of Sim3hala.^461 In another inscription the king of Sim3hala is described as waiting on the shore.^462 In other inscriptions Sim3hala is variously designated as Sin3gala-des4am,^463 Si1lam^464 and Sihala.^465 All this evidence favours the suggestion that as territorial names Sim3hala and Lan3ka1 were convertible terms, although the latter is also used as the name of a city. Priaulx remarks and probably, correctly, that Lan3ka1 was the old mythological name for Ceylon, and that later on it was supplanted by Ta1mraparn2i1, and subsequently when the Periplus was written, by Palaesimundus or Palaesimoundon which itself was transformed into Salike, Seren2diva derived from Pali Sihala or Sihala di1pa.^466 The name Palaesimoundon is very plausibly based on “pa1re samudrasya”,^467 in the description given of Lan3ka1 as noted above. Ptolemy's Simoundon^468 also refers to that name. But in Ptolemy's Geography the island is called Salike which responds to Siele diba of Kosmas Indicopleustes^469 both of which have their sources in Sihalam “the Pa1li form of Sanskrit Sim3hala” or Ceylon. To this source may be traced its other names such as Serendib, Zeilan, Sialan,^470 the last one yielding to Ceylon. Marco Polo's Seilan^471 is a nearer approach to the modern name. Van-der-turk suggests that the name may have been derived from Sela or ‘precious stone’, hence the island was anciently called Ratnadvi1pa.^472 An Arab historian called it the “Island of Rubies”. The Chinese name for the island also implies reference to gems. The name Saila1n also occurs in the works of Rashiduddin, Hayton and Jordanus.^473 Al-Beruni called it Singaldi1b.^474 Sim3hala is perhaps so called as once abounding in lions.^475 We may note here that there are references to another Sim3hala quite different from Ceylon.^476 It was placed to the east of Marudes4a and to the south of the Ka1ma1dri. It is evidently in the Punjab-Rajasthan region and reminds us of the kingdom of Sim3hapura mentioned by Hiuen Tsang.

20. S4aka (No. 1, L. 23): One of the tribes which is said to have paid homage to Samudragupta. As we have already discussed in connexion with the Murun2d2as, the expression, ‘S4aka-Murun2d2a’ should  not be translated to mean S4aka-lords. Following Fleet^477 we may better split the expression into two distinct names, the S4akas and Murun2d2as. The S4akas in the time of Samudragupta (4th century A.D.) must be the S4akas of Western India belonging to the Satrapal family of Cas2t2ana and Rudrada1man. In this period the S4aka ruler was Rudrasim3ha II and his successor Rudrasim3ha III, whose coins come up to A.D. 390, was killed by Candragupta II.^478 Other persons of that nationality were ruling in and about Sa1n5ci1.^479 The Scyths, whom Indians named as S4akas, were originally living on the borders of Bactria. A nomadic people called Yueh-Chih by the Chinese forced them to move from that place. Eventually in the beginning of the first century B.C., the S4akas moved on from Bactria to attack first the Parthians of Iran, and then the Greeks in India.^480 By the middle of the Ist Century B.C. there remained only a few petty Greek chiefs in India, and the power of the S4akas reached Mathura1. The S4akas continued the earlier practice of issuing coins with bilingual legends in Greek and Prakrit. The earliest S4aka king in India was Maues (about C. 80 B.C.)^481 Towards the close of the first Century A.D., the Sa1tava1hanas were pushed out from the North-West Deccan by the invading S4akas of the Ks2ahara1ta clan; but the S4atava1hanas under the greatest of their rulers, Gautami1putra S4a1takarn2in recovered their lands about A.D. 130. After this event nothing more is heard of the Ks2ahara1tas.^482 Another S4aka dynasty, called the Ka1rddamaka family but generally known as the “Western Satraps”, gained control of Kathiawar and Malwa at about the same time, and ruled roughly upto A.D. 400, and at the hight of their power governing much of Rajasthan and Sind also. The greatest ruler of this dynasty was Rudrada1man, who has left the earliest important inscription in correct Sanskrit,^483 a long panegyric which records his martial exploits, and his reconstruction of a great artificial lake at Girnar in Kathiawar, which had been excavated under Candragupta and improved in the time of As4oka. This inscription is among the earliest certainly dated records  of ancient India, and proves that Rudrada1man was reigning in A.D. 150.^484 Samudragupta's main effort was in the direction of the West, where the S4akas had ruled for over 200 years and which was enriched by the lucrative western trade. The S4akas at that time controlled Malwa and Kathiawar and were a power to be reckoned with. ‘Though the Allahabad Pillar Inscription claims that Samudragupta received homage from “the S4aka lords”, it is probable that he did not measure swords with them’.^485 It is clear that the S4aka homage to Samudragupta was not at all sincere and reliable since it was not tendered to his successor,^486 and Candragupta II had to conquer the S4akas once again. There is indeed a tradition that on the death of Samudragupta the S4akas succeeded in shaking the Gupta Empire, and forced the weak king, Ra1magupta, to conclude a dishonourable peace.^487 Most authorities reject the story, and deny the historicity of Ra1magupta, but the recent discovery of copper coins bearing his name^488 strengthens the suggestion that the tradition has a basis of fact.^489 It was Candragupta II (C. 376-415), the son of Samudragupta and younger brother of the shadowy Ra1magupta, who finally defeated the S4akas, soon after A.D. 388^490 So he is rightly remembered as ‘S4aka1ri’ ‘the enemy of the S4akas’.^491 The trousers were introduced into India by the S4akas and seem to have been in vogue among the ruling classes during the Gupta times, for Gupta kings often appear on their coins as wearing trousers.^492 The S4akas were notorious drinkers. It is said that Cyrus defeated the S4akas, when they were maddened by wine.^493 It has been suggested by Buddha Prakash that as a result of the influence of the S4akas, the vogue for excessive drinking spread. Strabo^494 speaks of a Bacchanalian festival of the Persian, in which men and women, dressed in Scythian style passed day and night in drinking and wanton play.^495 We know of similar drinking bouts in the Maha1bha1rata.^496 Probably the Scythians and the Iranians popularised drinking in the Punjab. The people of the Gangetic country, sticking to pristine ideals of moderation did not relish the exotic drink ing bouts popularised in the Punjab, under S4aka and Persian influence. Baudha1yana in his Dharmasu1tra, Karn2a in the Maha1bha1rata, and the Buddha in his discourses denounced drinking and laid down a prohibition against it.^497 But all this is not agreeable since Buddha and Baudha1yana belong to a period before the coming of the S4akas. A1ryans have been great lovers of drinking. We can find sufficient evidence for the drinking before S4akas. We may here refer to the S4aka Era (A.D. 78), which is very popular in India even to-day. Traditionally this era is known to have been founded by a S4aka king who occupied Ujjayini1 137 years after Vikrama1ditya. The era may in fact have been founded by Kanis2ka. It was certainly used early in the 2nd Centuary A.D. by the “Western Satraps”, who ruled Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence, the use of the era spread through the Deccan and was exported to South-East Asia.^498 Because of its long association with the S4aka Satraps the era may have earned its present name. The S4akas came to be included in the category of the martial classes of ancient India. Manu^499 refers to the warlike people on the fringes of A1ryan civilization, including the Greeks (Yavana), the Scyths (S4aka), and the Parthians (Pahlava), as ks2atriyas who had fallen from grace through their neglect of the sacred law, but who could be received once more into A1ryan fold by adopting the orthodox way of life and performing appropriate penitential sacrifices.^500 The S4akas were a white-skinned tribe or race of people; in the legends which relate the contests between Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra, the S4akas are fabled to have been produced by the cow of Vasis2t2ha, from her sweat, for the destruction of Vis4va1mitra's army.^501 Buddha Prakash^502 traces the S4aka invasion on the basis of literary and linguistic considerations. The name of the capital of the Madras, S4a1kala, and that of the region between the Ravi and the Chenab, S4a1kaladvi1pa, are based on the word S4aka and are indicative of a S4aka invasion. Likewise, the name of the clan S4a1kya, to which Buddha belonged, enshrines a reminiscene of the word S4aka. Moreover, the place-names ending in kantha1 existing in the  whole of the Punjab from the Bannu valley to the Kankhala region and even beyond suggest an intrusion of the S4akas long before the time of Pa1n2ini,^503 who is known to have flourished one century before the invasion of Alexander, the Great. Kantha1 is a S4aka word for city^504 and is akin to kadha1vara or kantha1vara of Kharos2t2hi1 inscriptions, Kand of Persian, Kantha1 of Khotanese, Kandh of Sogdian, Kandai of Pushto, Kanda or Koent of the dialect of the R2s2ikas. It is significant that the land beyond the Oxus, the Urheimat of the S4akas, abounds in Kantha1-ending place names, such as Samarkand, Khokand, Chimkand, Tashkand, Panjkand, and Yarkand. The reference to the stepped-well, called S4akandhu after the S4akas, together with that worked by Persian Wheel, known as Karkandhu after the Karkians, in a va1rttika of Katya1yana^505 also leads to the same conclusion. At the time of Alexander's invasion the S4akas lived at the north-western borders of India. That this tide of S4aka invasion, descending from the north-west, touched the eastern extremity of India, is manifest from the traditions of the Pura1n2as that the S4akas advanced to Ayodhya1 during the reign of King Ba1hu and that his son Sagara checked and repelled them.^506 In the Maha1bha1rata the S4akas are stated to have constituted along with Cu1likas, Tus2a1ras and Yavanas, the right wing of the Kraun5cavyu1ha formed by Bhi1s2ma on the sixth day of the battle. ^507 Caraka in his medical treatise^508 refers to them in the context of Central Asiatic tribes, viz. Ba1hlika, Pahlava, Ci1na, Yavana and S4aka.^509 Buddha Prakash also tries to trace the remnants of the S4akas in modern times.^510 The S4akas came into Punjab after the Yavanas or the Greeks. During their long rule they contributed a great deal to Indian culture and ultimately became one with the Indian people.^511 The depth of their influence on Indian society is manifest from the word thakura, which implies the ideas of nobility and divinity and stands for the Rajputs in the Punjab and is derived from the word thagora, taugara or tukhara.^512 The name Tukha1ra itself survives in the name of the Tokhi caste found in the North-West.^513 Another caste called Khosla  is a survival of Kusulaka, the surname of the Ks2ahara1ta chiefs Liaka Kusulaka and his son Patika Kusuluka. Analogous to this word is the name of Kuzula Kadphises the first Kus2a1n2a emperor to advance towards the Punjab. Hultzsch has equated this word with Turki gu7jlu7 meaning ‘strong’, and Sten Konow has compared it with Turki guzel, meaning ‘beautiful’, but Lu7ders has shown that it is the name of a family or clan of the S4akas.^514 So the name of Khosla is a remnant of this tribe.^515 Besides the Thakuras and Tokhis of the Punjab, there are caste-groups of Soi and Sikka, which are reminiscent of the S4akas.

21. Sanaka1ni1ka (No. 1, L. 22; No. 3, L. 2): In Inscription No. 3 it occurs with the short ‘i’ in the fourth syllable, i. e. as ‘Sanaka1nika’.^516 The Sanaka1ni1kas were also subjugated by Samudragupta along with other tribes who payed him all kinds of taxes, obeyed his orders and were coming to perform obeisance.^517 In the Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, of the Year 82 (A.D. 401) (No. 3), we know of a Maha1ra1ja of the ‘Sanaka1ni1ka’ tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candragupta II and who is stated to have recorded his gift on a Vais2n2ava Cave temple at Udayagiri.^518 Udayagiri is a well-known hill about two miles to the north-west of Bhilsa, ancient Vidis4a1.^519 Thus we can say that the Sanaka1ni1kas lived in the neighbourhood of Bhilsa.^520 D.R. Bhandarkar mentions them to have held the province of Vidis4a1 but he also locates Gan2apatina1ga's kingdom (one of the kings subjugated by Samudragupta) in Vidis4a1.^521 So his view seems to be inconsistent. It may be noted that the Sanaka1ni1ka feudatory chief of Candragupta II, as well as his father and grandfather, bore the title Maha1ra1ja. This may suggest that the Sanaka1ni1kas, and probably other tribes mentioned along with them in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription were not tribal republics, as is generally supposed, but were ruled by hereditary chiefs.^522 The name of the grandfather of this Sanaka1ni1ka feudatory chief of Candragupta II, is given as Chagalaga ‘which looks like a foreign name’;^523 but his father bears a purely Hindu name: ‘Vis2n2uda1sa’. Of course the present chief's name is illegible in the inscription (No. 3).^524 But considering the trend  it may be surmised that his name also was a Sanskrit name.^525 It seems that the tribe which originally consisted of aboriginal people was gradually coming under the influence of Sanskrit culture.

22. Va1hlika (No. 20, L. 2): The Meharauli1 Pillar Inscription (No. 20) describes the digvijaya of a king named Candra (i. e. Candragupta II) in the first verse as stated below: “He, on whose arm fame was inscribed by the sword, when, in battle in the Van3ga countries, he kneaded (and turned) back with (his) breast the enemies who, uniting together, came against him; -he, by whom, having crossed in warfare the seven mouths of the (river) Sindhu, the Va1hlikas were conquered; -he, by the breezes of whose prowess the Southern ocean is even still perfumed”.^526 We find various readings of the name Va1hlika in literature which are: Va1hlika, Ba1hlika, Va1hli1ka and Ba1hli1ka. In our inscription (No. 20) ‘Va1hlika1h2’, i. e. Va1hlika in plural denotes the people of Va1hlika i. e. Bactria (modern Balkh) region on the Oxus in the northern part of Afghanistan.^527 Mislead by a verse in the Ra1ma1yan2a,^528 D.R. Bhandarkar^529 places Va1hlikas in the close proximity of the Vipa1s4a1, the modern Beas. The reading Va1hli1ka1n in the passage quoted from the Ra1ma1yan2a is a mistake for Va1hi1ka1n. Numerous passages can be quoted from the Epic, Puranic and classical Sanskrit literature to prove that the Punjab = Pan5canada, ‘the land of five rivers’, was in ancient times called the Va1hi1ka country.^530 ‘Va1hi1ka’ was, in fact, a general term for the whole of Punjab. We know S4a1kala as Va1hi1ka-gra1ma from Patan5jali and also Pa1tanaprastha which is modern Pathankot by the same term. Moreover, Vatsya1yana in his Ka1masu1tra and Rajas4ekhara in his Ka1vya-mi1ma1m3sa1 mention the people of Ba1hli1ka and Punjab as two separate entities. ^531 There is, however, one verse in the Karn2aparvan of the Maha1bha1rata which suggests that Va1hi1ka was originally the name of a country or people on the Vipa1s4a1, (the Beas): “In the Vipa1s4a1, there were two Pis4a1cas named Vahi and Hika; their descendants are called Va1hi1kas who are not the creation of Praja1pati”.^532  Later on the sense of the word expanded to cover all the tribes living in the Punjab. It is interesting to note that the Ma1ha1bha1rata sometimes uses the terms Va1hi1ka, Madra, Jartika, A1rat2t2a and Pan5canada synonymously. It appears that the lands of these tribes which lived close to one another became in course of time moulded into a big kingdom under the powerful kings of S4a1kala (Sialkot). As Va1hi1ka was beyond Kurukshetra and, therefore, outside the boundary of Brahma1varta, its analogical connection with the word ‘bahis’ may have been another cause of the expansion of its geographical sense.^533 This is also reflected in the Va1rttikas of Katya1yana who derives the word ‘Va1hi1ka’ from ‘vahis’ or ‘bahis’, meaning ‘outside’ (the pale of A1ryandom).^534 Some scholars^535 rely on the description of the Ba1hlikas as the offspring of two Pis4a1cas, Bahi and Hika, as given in the Maha1bha1rata. Buddha Prakash holds that fresh stream of the Bactrian people which swooped over the Punjab came to be known as Ba1lhikas; their name which became a general designation for the people of Punjab was later corrupted as Va1hi1ka.^536 But we have already shown that the two were separate entities. We know that the Va1hi1kas were the people living within the boundaries of the five rivers including the sixth Sindhu (Indus),^537 but according to the Meharauli1 Pillar Inscription Candragupta conquered Va1hlikas after crossing the seven months of the (river) Indus (sapta mukha1ni sindhoh2).^538 So Va1hlika of our inscription is certainly Balkh in the extreme north of Afghanistan.^539 Bajpai^540 opposes it on the ground that Candragupta could not have gone to so far off a place as Bactria which is situated across the Hindukush and rejects the older contention of scholars that the Kus2a1n2as were ruling in Bactria during king Candra's campaign and that he crossed the Hindukush to crush them. But the view of Bajpai is not tenable since it is clear from the lines in our inscription^541 that king Candra had conquered the Va1hlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the river Indus. So far as the literary evidence is concerned we find that Ba1lhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda;^542 here  the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the Mu1javants, the Maha1vr2s2as, and the Balhikas. The Mu1javants are quite certainly a northern tribe, and though the passage may contain a pun on Ba1lhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from bahis, ‘without’),^543 still there is no doubt that the name was chosen from a northern tribe.^544 The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a1^545 mentions a Kuru king named Balhika Pra1tipi1ya. It seems that Balhika was a descendant of Prati1pa. But there is no evidence to show why he bore the name Balhika.^546 He is perhaps the same as Maha1ra1ja Ba1hlika Pra1ti1peya of the Maha1bha1rata.^547 The Ra1ma1yan2a shows that the Royal Kuru family originally migrated from the Ba1hli1ka country. The passage in question^548 says that Ila, son of the Praja1pati Kardama, who was the king of the Va1hli country, gave up Bahlika in favour of his son S4as4avindu, and founded a new city Pratis2t2ha1napura in the Madhya-des4a, where his other son Pururava Aila continued to rule. This links up the Ailas, the progenitor of the Kurus, with the Kardama royal family of Ba1hli. H.C. Raychaudhuri^549 suggests that Ka1rddama, the name of the ruling family of Va1hlika, was obtained from the river of that name in Persia, and thus infers that the home of the Ka1rddama king is to be identified with Bahlika or Balkh in Iran. This view was earlier advocated by Roth^550 and Weber.^551 But Zimmer^552 rightly shows that there is no need to assume any Iranian influence.^553 We know Va1hli1ka from the Puranic list of peoples^554 The Account of fifty-six countries^555 is interesting as it mentions them with the Hu1n2as, Kauravas, Ga1ndha1ras and Vidarbhas among others. In the S4aktisan3gama Tantra^556 Ba1hli1ka is described as famous for horses and situated to the east of Maha1mlechha and beginning with Kamboja. B.C. Law on the basis of reference in the Maha1bha1rata^557 places the Va1hlikas in the neighbourhood of Gandhar and Kamboja.^558 Katya1yana (4th century B.C.)^559 mentions Ba1hla1yana and derives it from the word Ba1hli, a country also mentioned in the Arthas4a1stra of Kaut2ilya.^560 The Va1yu Pura1n2a, S4iva Pura1n2a1, Ka1vya-Mi1ma1m3sa1 of Ra1jas4ekhara and the Ra1ma1yan2a^561 place the Va1hlika country in the  northern division.^562 Ba1hlika is the name of a person in the Vis2n2u-Pura1n2a.^563 The Na1t2yas4a1stra^564 of Bharata says that Ba1hlikabha1s2a1 was spoken by the northern people (Udi1cyas). A similar reference is also to be found in the Sa1hitya-darpan2a.^565 In the Ka1masu1tra of Vatsya1yana,^566 Ba1hli1ka is grouped with Stri1ra1jya, which occurs in the list of North-Western division. The peculiar custom in Ba1hlika of several young men being married to a single woman as in stri1ra1jya (stri1ra1jye ca Ba1hlike...), appears to be an outlandish custom prevaiting in the regions to the west of India.^567 The Jayaman3gala1 commentary also says that Ba1hli1ka was in Uttara1patha.^568 We find the word Va1hlika occurring in the Amara-kos4a in two ways:

बाह्लिक
1. Ba1hlika^569

बाह्लीक
2. Ba1hli1ka^570 The Amarakos4a shows that Ba1hli1ka was famous for horses, saffron and Ferula Asafoetida (hin3gu). The reference to saffron leads us to the filaments of saffron on the banks of Van3ks2u (oxus) where Raghu gave defeat to the Hu1n2as as described in Ka1lida1sa's Raghuvam3s4a.^571 The reading Sindhu of the passage^572 is plainly a mistake for Van3ks4u which is corroborated by Ks2i1rasva1min, the earliest commentator of Amara who clearly shows that the Ba1hli1ka country was bordered on the Oxus.^573 The Br2hatsam3hita1^574 places Ba1hli1kas in the jurisdiction of the Sun. Ancient tradition connects the Ba1hlikas with the Dha1rs2t2akas, a Ks2atriya clan which occupied the Ba1hli1ka country.^575 We know that Ba1hli1ki1 was another name of Ma1dri1, queen of the Madras.^576 Buddha Prakash suggests that the Vedic school of the Bha1llavins enshrined the memory of the Ba1hli1kas; the modern sub-castes of the Barasarin sub-group of the khatris Bhalla and Behl represent the ancient Ba1lhi1kas, and the Ja1t2 clans of Bha1la1r and Bhalerah, found in Multan, the Baloch tribe Bhalka1, living in Sindh, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan and the clan Bhallowana, found in Shahpur, are remnants of the far-flung Ba1hlika tribes.^577 There is a possibility of the Ba1hli1kas migrating from their original home Balkh to the Punjab.^578 When Hieun Tsang visited Balkh, it was a centre of Buddh ist faith,^579 but after the overthrow of the Sassanid kingdom by the Arabs, the ancient Bactria along with the adjoining territories passed under the control of Khorasan, the seat of the Muhammadan power.^580

यौधेय
23. Yaudheya (No. 1, L. 22): The Yaudheyas are included among the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. In his time, they seem to have occupied northern Rajputana and south-east Punjab, and their territory extended up to the confines of the Bahawalpur State where their name survives in the name of the tract called Johiyawar.^581 Their earliest reference in the inscriptions is found in the Juna1gar2h Rock Inscription of Rudrada1man I (A.D. 150)^582 which mentions the victory of Maha1ks2atrapa Rudrada1man over the Yaudheyas who were ‘proud of their heroism’. The Bijayagadh Inscription^583 which is a record of the Yaudheyas (in Bra1hmi1 characters of the second-third century A.D.)^584 connects them with Bharatpur State in Rajputana. It refers to one Maha1ra1ja Maha1sena1pati, the ruler of the Yaudheya-gan2a.^585 Literally the word Yaudheya means ‘a warrior’ which corresponds with the Ossadu7 of Arrian, the Sambastae of Diodorus and the Sambracae of Curtius, who made their submission to Alexander.^586 They were a powerful nation and their forces consisted of 60,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots.^587 We get three different versions about the origin of the Yaudheyas: (i) In the Maha1bha1rata^588 it is stated that Yudhis2t2hira married the daughter of the S4aivya King Gova1sana named Devika1 and begot a son from her named Yaudheya. Buddha Prakash^589 and M.K. Sharan,^590 on this basis, have been tempted to connect the Yaudheyas with Yudhis2t2hira, the eldest of the Pa1n2d2ava brothers. D.K. Gupta questions the foundations of this theory on this solitary basis in the absence of a more solid or a positive evidence;^591 but on the other hand he himself has indulged in connecting the A1rjuna1yanas with the epic hero Arjuna.^592 (ii) The Vis2n2u-Pura1n2a gives a contrary view of the same story. It states that Yaudheyi1 was the queen of Yudhis2t2hira from whom he had a son named Devaka^593  (iii) The Harivam3s4a^594 and the Va1yu Pura1n2a^595 state that King Us4i1nara of the Puru dynasty had five queens named Nr2ga1 or Mr2ga1, Kr2mi1, Nava1, Darva1 and Dr2s2advati1 who gave birth to five sons named Nr2ga, (or Mr2ga), Kr2mi, Nava, Suvrata and S4ibi (or S4ivi) respectively. S4ibi was the lord of the S4ibi people or of the city of S4ivapura, while Nr2ga (or Mr2ga) was the ruler of the Yodheyas or of Yaudheyapura. The other three sons of Us4i1nara, viz., Nava, Kr2mi and Suvrata, were the lords respectively of Navara1s2t2ra, Kr2mila1puri1 and Ambas2t2hapuri1.^596 According to Pargiter, King Us4inara established the Yaudheyas, Ambas2t2has, Navara1s2t2ra, and the city of Kr2mila1, all on the eastern border of the Punjab; while his famous son S4ivi Aus4i1nara originated the S4ivis or S4rbis in Sivapura.^597 It is very difficult to reject or accept the Puranic tradition without any further evidence. However, as regards their connection with Us4i1nara, we may say that scholars are somewhat confused by differing versions by varied text with regard to the territory ruled over by him.^598 The R2gveda, the Ja1takas as well as the accounts of Fahien and Hiuen Tsang connect the Us4i1naras with a region farther to the north-west in Swat Valley, a part of the ancient Maha1janapada of Gandha1ra; while the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, the Kaus4i1taki1 Upanis2ad and the Katha1saritsa1gara associate them to the region north of Haridwar near the source of Ganges at Kanakhala. It is possible that originally they were settled in the Swat Valley but by the passage of time, they migrated to other places as well. For example, we find that the S4ibis were known to Alexander's followers, living between the Indus and the Akesines (Chenab).^599 In the Maha1bha1rata,^600 the Yaudheyas are described as having been defeated by Arjuna, along with the Ma1lavas and Trigarttas. In the Sabha1parvan,^601 the Yaudheyas together with the S4ibis and the Trigarttas are represented as having paid homage to Yudhis2t2hira. In the Dron2aparvan,^602 we find that an epithet ‘Adrija’ meaning ‘mountain-born’, is used for the Yaudheyas. The Yaudheyas were one of the republican tribes of the  Punjab. Pa1n2ini^603 includes them among the a1yudhaji1vi1 sam3ghas together with the Pars4us who are considered to be Persians by Dr. Buddha Prakash.^604 Pa1n2ini mentions the Yaudheyas in another Su1tra also.^605 Kaut2ilya also refers to the Yaudheya as a warrior clan of the Punjab.^606 The Br2hatsam3hita1^607 places them in the northern division of India and describes them as being in the region of Br2haspati.^608 In the Sa1hityadarpan2a of Vis4vana1tha, they are described as interested in gambling (di1vyata1m) and speaking the Southern Vaidarbhi1.^609 Yaudheya coins have been found all over the area from Saharanpur to Multan. In the Ludhiana district have been unearthed their votive tablets. A rich find of their coin-moulds was brought to light by B. Sahni at Khokrakot near Rohtak where there seems to have existed a regular mint.^610 Their new currency^611 depicting their tutelary deity Ka1rttikeya which replaced the Kus2a1n2a currency in these regions, shows that they played a leading part in the extermination of S4aka rule in India.^612 The findings of the Yaudheya coins in large number at Saharanpur, Dehradoon, Delhi, Rohtak and Kangra attest the fact that they had driven out the Kus2a1n2as from these areas and had re-established themselves firmly, in the 3rd-4th century A.D.^613 One of their seals, bearing the legend “Yaudheya1na1m jayamantradhara1n2a1m”^614 shows that they were held in high esteem among the warrior-clans of the Punjab. Some scholars seem to be confused about its interpretation. Shobha Mukerji^615 opines that their coins were issued in the name of the gan2a as well as the Mantra-dharas. M.K. Sharan^616 explains the word “Mantradhara” to mean the members of the Executive Committee “those vested with the policy of the state”. He is of the opinion that one set of the Yaudheya coins is struck in the name of the “Mantradharas” and the “Gan2a”, while the other set is struck simply in the name of Gan2a.^617 He seems to have wrongly substituted the reading “Mantradha1ra” for “Mantradhara”. He has been arbitrary in separating “Jaya” from Mantradhara1n2a1m”^618 which forms a compound by the combination of the two words. Further he rejects the view of some historians who consider the word “Mantradhara1n2a1m” to mean  ‘those who were in possession of Victory Charm’. But he contradicts himself at another place while explaining a seal^619 found at Naurangabad with the remarks: “This seal indicates the bravery of the tribe and that they were never defeated as they had adopted the title of ‘जयमन्त्रधराः’”. Actually the expression may mean ‘the Yaudheyas who knew the secret of victory’. It is symbolic of their victory and pride that they never got defeated. Another word which has raised some controversy among the scholars is “Darma” found on some of the Yaudheya coins. Some scholars take it to mean Dharma while others take it for ‘Dama’ or ‘Darma’ to be a Sanskritised form of Greek -“Drachma”.^620 Again some controversy arose whether it was a Copper one or of silver.^621 The word ‘Damma’ or ‘Dramma’ has been used for a gold coin.^622 It may be remarked that the word borrowed from some foreign language may not strictly be used in the original sense and hence it may simply mean coin.^623 The Kus2a1n2as had introduced gold-coins which were later on adopted by the Guptas. But the Yaudheyas seem to have never adopted the gold currency since so far we have found no gold coin belonging to them. This may speak of their weaker economic condition; surely they could not compare with powerful monarchies. On some of the Yaudheya coins, we have the mysterious words, “dvi” (two) and “tri” (three) after the legend “Yaudheyagan2asya jayah2” which may point out their making a confederation with other tribes, viz., the A1rjuna1yanas and the Kun2indas.^624 They seem to have controlled the area lying on the banks of the river Sutlej up to the borders of the Bahawalpur State which is still called Johiyawar. The word ‘Johiya’ is apparently an abbreviation of ‘Jodhiya’, which is the Sanskrit Yaudheya.^625 Cunningham, however, takes the words ‘dvi’ and ‘tri’ of the above-mentioned coins to signify ‘the money of the second and third tribes of the Yaudheyas’.^626 M.K. Sharan^627 has enlisted about twenty-four types and Symbols on the coins of the Yaudheyas which may point to their religious leanings as well bear out some aspects of their social life. They are as follows: 1. Bull 2. Elephant  3. Deer 4. Peacock 5. Tree-in-railing 6. Human figure standing (warrior) 7. Laks2mi1 8. Cobra 9. Scythic-like object (Yu1pa) 10. Stu1pa 11. Tris4u1la 12. Nandipada 13. Shell 14. Svastika 15. Vase or Man3gala Kalas4a 16. Tribal sign or Ujjayini1 Symbol 17. Two ‘s’ with a line in between probably representing two hooded snakes 18. Triangular-headed symbol or more probably a Yu1pa 19. Zig-Zag line depicting snake or river 20. Circles with dots around, probably representing the sun 21. Curved object within railing, probably a representation of the Yu1pa 22. Hill so-called Caitya 23. Six-headed S2as2t2hi1 or Kr2ttika1^628 24. S4iva. 

राष्ट्र
Ra1s2t2ra^1 (from §ra1j): It is the oldest and biggest territorial term. In the R2gveda^2 and later Sam3hita1s,^3 it denotes ‘kingdom’ or ‘royal territory’. It is considered to be one of the Prakr2tis (constituents)^4 and refers to a country.^5 It was the name of a Commissioner's division under the Ra1s2t2raku1t2as.^6 In South India, under the Pallavas, Kadambas, and Sa1lan3ka1yanas also it denotes only a district, if not a tehsil.^7 The Samara1n3gan2asu1tradha1ra^8 says that ‘all the ra1s2t2ra including nagara is called des4a or man2d2ala while nagara is excluded in janapada’. It divides ra1s2t2ras into three kinds: -(i) Big: It consists of nine thousand and ninety villages, but some scholars say that the nine thousand and sixty four villages make a big ra1s2t2ra.^9 (ii) Middle: It consists of five thousand, three hundred and eighty four villages.^10 (iii) Small: It consists of one thousand, five hundred and forty eight villages.^11 It further discusses that seven cities should be established in each ra1s2t2ra.^12 In place-names ra1s2t2ra is changed into:^13 (a) Ra1t2ha1, as Maha1ra1s2t2ra, Mara1t2ha1 (b) Ra1t2, at Mayara1s2t2ra, (= Mayara1t2), Mira1t2 It also changes into rat2t2a, Cf. Na1girat2t2a. Walde also derives it from §ra1j-(n. sg. ra1t2) Sk. ra1s2t2ra: AV. ra1star -,^14  In ancient Indian history extending over several centuries, we do not find uniformity in the nomenclature of the different territorial and administrative divisions in the various kingdoms flourishing in different centuries and provinces. In the small kingdoms like those of the Pallavas, the Va1ka1t2akas and Ga1had2ava1las we usually find reference to only one territorial division, the district variously called vis2aya or ra1s2t2ra.^15 Following are the names with this ending:

देवराष्ट्र
1. Devara1s2t2ra (No. 1, L. 20): It has been mentioned as ruled by Kubera one of the kings ruling in Southern Region who were subdued by Samudragupta. Dey^16 identifies it with the Maratha country (i. e. Maha1ra1s2t2ra). Fleet and Smith are also of the same opinion. G. Ramdas slightly differs from them when he identifies Devara1s2t2ra with modern Devagiri in the Dharwar district.^17 According to R.D. Banerjee^18 Devara1s2t2ra is the name of a district or province in Kalin3ga. B.C. Law^19 identifies it with Yellowmanchili taluka of the Vizagapatam district, which is also the view of H.C. Raychaudhuri,^20 S.B. Chaudhuri,^21 Dubreuil and Bhandarkar.^22 This view is generally accepted at present. Earlier scholars held that Samudragupta made a round of the South crossing from the eastern to the western coast of India. But this involves serious difficulties about his potential relations with the Va1ka1t2akas. Now, scholars describe southern campaign of Samudragupta as confined to the eastern coast. Thus it becomes apparent that Devara1s2t2ra was conterminous with Kos4ala (Sirpur). Ta1mralipti may have been included in Devara1s2t2ra.^23 2. Mu1la-Na1girat2t2a (No 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15): L. 2 of the inscription mentions a man2d2ala (sub-division) called Na1girat2t2a (Na1girat2t2a-ma1n2d2alika) and later on refers to Mu1laNa1girat2t2a which seems to have been the headquarters of this man2d2ala. It is clear from the inscription itself that Mu1laNa1girat2t2a was situated in the neighbourhood of Nitva-Goha1li1.^24 Mu1la-Na1girat2t2a literally means ‘Na1girat2t2a Proper’. The word Na1girat2t2a is the Prakritic form of Na1gara1s2t2ra meaning ‘a country of the Na1gas’.

सुराष्ट्र
3. Sura1s2t2ra (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9): In L. 8 Sura1s2t2ra is used in plural^25 while in L. 9 it is an adjective of avani (land).^26 In this inscription great importance has been  attached to Sura1s2t2ra. After his conquests, Skandagupta deliberated for days and nights together as to whom should be entrusted important task of guarding the land of the Sura1s2t2ras.^27 At last he was satisfied by appointing Parn2adatta as a governor over this western^28 region. Sura1s2t2ra corresponds with Southern Kathiawar with its Prakrit name Sorat2h.^29 Literally the name means a good country. It was so named probably on account of the natural fertility of the land, Sorat2h is well known for rich crops of all kinds, and splendid cattle.^30 Sura1s2t2ra^31 is mentioned in the Juna1gar2h Rock Inscription of Rudrada1man I (A.D. 150). It was governed by Pus2yagupta, under Candragupta Maurya and by a Yavana Tus2a1spa under As4oka.^32 The Pura1n2as^33 and the Ka1vyami1ma1m3sa1^34 mention it a country in the west while the Br2hatsam3hita1^35 mentions it as a country in the South. It may be due to the different geographical units made by the authors of the Ka1vyami1ma1m3sa1 and the Br2hatsam3hita1. Under Gupta emperors Ba1manasthali1 (modern Banthali) was the capital of Sura1s2t2ra, before Valabhi1 became its capital.^36 The name Sura1s2t2ra also occurs in the Maha1bha1rata, the Ja1takas^37, and several times in the Ra1ma1yan2a.^38 It is also mentioned in Patan5jali's Maha1bha1s2ya.^39 In Kaut2ilya's Arthas4a1stra, Sura1s2t2ras are mentioned as one of the corporations of warriors who lived by agriculture and trade.^40 According to the Arthas4a1stra the elephants of Sura1s2t2ra were inferior to those belonging to An3ga and Kalin3ga.^41 In the medieval period,^42 in three directions, Bhavanagar, Porabandar and Somanath (the famous temple) were the limits of Sura1s2t2ra. Place-names ending in Bhukti

भुक्ति
Bhukti (from §bhuj) Literally it means ‘enjoyment’ or possession.^43 Bhukti denoted an administrative division smaller than a modern Tehsil or Taluka in the Deccan and M.P., but in Northern India under the Guptas and Pratiha1ras it denoted a unit as large as the Commissioner's Division in modern times.^44 Thus  Pratis2t2ha1nabhukti consisted of only 12 and Koppa1rakabhukti of 50 villages in the Deccan under the Ra1s2t2raku1t2as,^45 whereas under the Guptas the Pun2d2ravardhanabhukti comprised of the districts of Dinajpur, Bogra and Rajshahi, and Magadhabhukti included the districts of Gaya1 and Pa1t2aliputra.^46 S4ra1vastibhukti under the Pratiha1ras included several districts in northern U.P.^47 The Bhuktis under the Pratiha1ra empire appear to have been rather Commissioners' Divisions than provinces.^48 Bhukti is changed into huti as Jejakabhukti, Jejahuti.^49 The unit bhukti which so often appears in the inscriptions of the Gupta period as the designation of an administrative unit is not frequently found in the early medieval period.^50 The mention of a Nagara-bhukti is also made in Deo-Baranark Inscription of Ji1vitagupta II.^51 We find only one place name with the suffix bhukti which is detailed below: Pun2d2ravardhana (No. 28, L. 1; No. 33, LL. 1-2; No. 34, L. 2; No. 35, L. 2; No. 36, L. 2; No. 37, L. 2; No. 43, L. 14): This bhukti is mentioned in the Gupta epigraphs ranging from the years 124 to 224 of the Gupta era, i. e. from A.D. 443 to 543. It formed an integral part of Gupta empire during this period. According to Inscription No. 37, a noble man (kulaputra) Amr2tadeva by name belonging to Ayodhya1 approached the local government of Kot2ivars2a of which Svyambhudeva was the governor, under the provincial government of Pun2d2ravardhana-bhukti, during the reign of Bha1nugupta, and prayed that he might be given, by means of a copper-plate document in accordance with the prevailing custom, some rent-free waste lands. His prayer was granted. General Cunningham^52 identifies Pun2d2ravardhana with the extensive ruins known as ‘Maha1stha1ngarh’, 8 miles north of the town of Bogra. The river Karatoya1 was the dividing line between Pun2d2ravardhana-bhukti and Ka1maru1pa.^53 According to Wilson, the ancient kingdom of Pun2d2rades4a included the districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Bogra and Tirhut.^54 It seems to have been the biggest administrative division or province of the Gupta empire, divided into several vis2ayas and man2d2alas of which twenty-four^55 are mentioned  in known epigraphs. In short Pun2d2ravardhana signified North Bengal. Pun2d2ravardhana, as the name suggests, was a settlement of the Pun2d2ras.^56 The first reference to the Pun2d2ras is found in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a.^57 The earliest literary reference to Pun2d2ravardhana is to be traced in the Buddhist work, the Divya1vada1na, where it is mentioned as the easternmost city of India.^58 The Paun2d2ra country is mentioned also in the Br2hatsam3hita1,^59 as situated in the east.^60 The Ka1vyami1m3a1m3sa1 also mentions it as a Janapada in the east. In the inscriptions of Bengal the name Pun2d2ravardhana was changed into Paun2d2ravardhana in the early part of the 12th century, when it occurs first in the Manahali grant of Madanapa1la and remained in use till the end of the Sena rule. The Ra1jataran3gin2i1 mentions Pun2d2ravardhana as the capital of Gaud2a which is also proved by a reference in Purus2ottama's lexicon (11th century A.D.)^61 The city lost its importance from the third quarter of the 12th century A.D. as the later Sena kings shifted their capital to Gaud2a in the Malda district. Towards the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century A.D. Pun2d2ravardhana was occupied by the Muhammedans.^62 Place-names ending in Vis2aya

विषय
Vis2aya According to Monier Williams it means a dominion, kingdom, territory, region, district, country, or abode and in plural it meant lands or possessions.^63 In the As2t2a1dhya1yi1^64 it denotes regions or provinces, called after their inhabitants, e. g. S4aiba, the region of the S4ibis; Ma1lavaka, the region of the Ma1lava people; Ra1janyaka, of the Ra1janya tribe and so forth. ‘The names according to Vis2aya seem to be based on the ethnic distribution of population over particular areas for the time being without reference to the form of government’.^65 The word Vis2aya in the su1tra Vis2ayo des4e^66 is significant. Jainendra, S4a1kat2a1yana and Hemacandra take it as ra1s2t2ra, and Vardhama1na as Janapada. The Ka1s4ika1 takes it as gra1ma-samuda1ya. Ka1taya1yana and Patan5jali interpret Vis2aya as being identical with janapada in some cases, but their comments give the impression that even such geographical units as were  not a janapada were called Vis2aya.^67 If Vis2aya and Janapada had been identical, Pa1n2ini would not have treated the former under a separate heading.^68 A Vis2aya denoted both a bigger unit having the status of a Janapada, and a smaller area which was but an estate. In the Ra1janya1di gan2a, vis2aya denotes janapadas, while in the Bhauriki and Ais2uka1ri gan2as,^69 it is landed property, the share of estate which was the source of livelihood. In the post-pa1n2inian period, distinction between Janapada and vis2aya was lost, both being called by the same names, for example An3ga1h2, Vanga1h2, Sumha1h2, and Pun2d2ra1h2. In some Janapadas like Ra1janya, the distinction was retained, as Ra1janyaka denoted a vis2aya and Ra1janya1h2, the Janapada of the Ra1janya tribe. Similarly we have Va1sa1tah2, Va1sa1tayah2; Gandha1rah2, Ga1ndha1rayah2; and S4aibah2, S4ibiyah2. Other smaller units were only vis2ayas or estates like Bailvavanaka, A1tmaka1meyaka, Bhaurikavidha and Ais2uka1ri-bhakta.^70 The vis2aya usually corresponded with the district of the modern administration.^71 Minor bhuktis, man2d2alas and the vis2ayas were used to denote the same administrative division in many cases.^72 The district administration was well organised in the Gupta period. Some of the land-grant charters bear the seals of the district administration.^73 Sealings of the district administration of Ra1jagr2ha and Gaya1 have been found at Na1landa1, showing that their correspondence to outsiders bore the impress of their official seals.^74 We have the following place-names ending in Vis2aya:

गया
1. Gaya1 (No. 21, L. 7): A village named Revatika1 belonging to the Gaya1 vis2aya was granted as an agraha1ra to a bra1hman2a, ostensibly by Samudragupta.^75 Gaya1 is at present headquarters of the Gaya1 district, 60 miles due south of Patna. It comprises the modern town of Sahebganj on the northern side and the ancient town of Gaya1 on the southern side.^76 Much has been written on Gaya1,^77 all of which is not possible to discuss here. We will confine ourselves to the origin of the name Gaya1 and the importance of Gaya1. In the R2gveda Gaya is a proper name applied to a composer of hymns.^78 In the Atharvaveda^79 Gaya appears to be a  wonder-worder or sorcerer along with Asita and Kas4yapa who later on transformed himself into Gaya1sura.^80 According to the Va1yu Pura1n2a,^81 the city was named Gaya after an Asura, Gaya by name (Gaya1sura). Vis2n2u killed this demon but granted him a boon that this city would be held highly sacred. According to R.L. Mitra,^82 this story is an allegorical representation of the expulsion of Buddhism from Gaya1 which was the headquarters of the Buddhist faith. Aurn2ava1bha in explaining ‘idam Vis2n2ur-vi1 Cakrame tredha1 nidadhe padam’^83 in the Nirukta^84 holds that the three steps of Vis2n2u were placed on Sama1rohan2a, Vis2n2upada and Gayas4iras. The Ma1habha1rata (III. 95 and VII. 64) describes the performance of sacrifices by Gaya^85 references to which^86 are also found in the Ra1ma1yan2a,^87 Bha1gavata Pura1n2a^88 Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,^89 Agni Pura1n2a,^90 Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,^91 Va1mana Pura1n2a,^92 etc. As4vaghos2a's Buddhacarita^93 (I or II cent. A.D.) speaks of the Buddha's visit to the hermitage called ‘the city of the royal sage Gaya’, who was later conceived as a great giant.^94 We can find evidence of the importance of Gaya1 growing in the period subsequent to A.D. 750. At Gaya1 while we have only one inscription belonging to the Gupta period, we get numerous inscriptions belonging to the Pa1la period.^95 But these records are of not much use for the history of the town, they simply show that till the end of the twelfth century A.D. it was under the Pa1las.^96 The city played no major role in polities at any period of history but it was certainly a centre of religious movements of Buddhist and the Brahmanical Hindus.^97 Gaya1 which was the headquarters of Buddhist faith passed to the Hindus between the second and fourth centuries of the Christian era and by A.D. 637 when Hiuen Tsang visited the city it had become a thriving centre of Hindu Brahmanical religion.^98 The religious importance of Gaya1 is met with in the Ma1ha1bha1rata,^99 Ra1ma1yan2a^100 and Pura1n2as.^101 The Gaya1 has a special religious importance with reference to the S4ra1ddha ceremony.^102

Kha1d(t2a1)pa1ra^103 (No. 29, L. 7): The inscription came from a place Dhanaidaha in the Natore subdivision of the Rajashahi district (in Pun2d2ravardhana).^104  So this vis2aya may be assigned to the Pun2d2ravardhana bhukti. The name of the district cannot be read with certainty. Sen^105 suggests three readings: Maha1-Khusha1pa1ra, Kha1da1(t2a1) pa1ra, or Khusaspa1ra. Banerji gives the reading ‘Maha1-khus2a1pa1ra.^106

कोटिवर्ष
3. Kot2ivars2a (No. 34, L. 3; No. 35, L. 3; No. 36, L. 3; No. 37, L. 3): It has been described as a vis2aya under Pun2d2ravardhana-bhukti. This reference clearly shows that the size of a vis2aya was smaller than that of a bhukti. The vis2aya of Kot2ivars2a occurs frequently in the epigraphic records of the Pa1las and Senas.^107 It seems to have comprised the southern part of the Dinajpur district, the northern portion of Rajashahi and probably also the eastern tracts of the Bogra district.^108 Its head-quarters was Diw-kot (Devakot2a or Devi1kot2a).^109 Ya1davapraka1s4a identifies Kot2ivars2a with Devi1kot2t2a.^110 The Va1yu Pura1n2a also refers to a city of the name of Kot2ivars2a.^111 The Prakrit lexicon Pa1ia-sadda-mahan2n2avo describes it as the capital of La1t2a country.^112 The name is known to the Jain Prajn5a1pana1 in which it is placed in La1d2ha or La1t2a.^113 Hemacandra^114 says that Kot2ivars2a, Ba1n2apura, Devi1kot2a, Uma1vana and S4on2itapura are identical. Purus2ottama^115 agrees with Hemacandra with the only difference that he mentions Us2a1vana in place of Uma1vana. Ba1n2apura is represented by Ba1ngarh in the Dinajpur district, which still preserves the extensive ruins of a citadel known as Damdamah2 said to have been the fort of Devi1kot2a associated with the exploits of the mythical king Ba1n2a.^116 Diw-kot2a or Devi1kot2a (wrongly read as Dihikota in the A-In-i-Akbari1) was a mahal under the Sarkar of Lakhnauti1 (Laks2an2avati1).^117 The termination vars2a is significant. It denotes a division of the earth as separated off by mountain ranges.^118 From the Pura1n2as we know of such names as Harivars2a, Kim3purus2aVars2a and Bha1rata-Vars2a.^119 Vars2am in Pa1n2ini^120 means the rainy season. We know that rains are connected with the mountains. So originally the divisions might have been made according to the rains in different areas. Rains being very important for agriculture affect the inhabitants of a certain area throughout the year. Later on the semantic development of the word came to denote a year. In India the seasons have been regarded to be important and hence they had often been used to  denote the year.^121

कृमिला
4. Kr2mila1 (No. 40, L. 5): The Vis2aya or district of Kr2mila1 also spelt as Krimila1 is mentioned in inscription No. 40. According to D.C. Sircar “as the charter is spurious and seems to have been forged a few centuries after Samudragupta's time, it may or may not prove the existence of a vis2aya and therefore of a city of the above name in the fourth century.^122 But certain old seals found at Na1landa1 prove the existence of Kr2mila1 before the Pa1la occupation of Bihar.^123 The village Kava1la in the Krimila1vis2aya known from one such seal can be identified with modern Kawa1li not far from Valgu1dar.^124 The vis2aya or district of Kr2mila1 is also mentioned in the records of the Pa1las of Bengal and Bihar.^125 According to a tradition recorded in the Harivam3s4a,^126 Vayu Pura1n2a^127 and the Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a^128 Kr2mi, the son of king Us4i1nara of the Puru dynasty, born of his second queen Kr2mi, was the lord of Kr2mila1puri1.^129 In the Buddhist literature, we get various forms for the city of Kr2mila1: Kimila1, Kimmila1 and Kimbila1. The name of an inhabitant of the city is given as Kimila, Kimmila1 or Kimbila1. Mala1lasekera^130 recognises the spellings Kimila1 or Kimbila1 and Kimila or Kimbila, but prefers the forms Kimbila1 and Kimbila1. Kimila1 can be the Pali form of Sanskrit Kr2mila1 (or Krimila1), and Kimmila1 can be derived from the other Sanskrit variant Kirmila1.^131 Two Suttas, the Kimila1sutta and Kimilasutta, were preached by the Buddha when he was camping at the city of Kimila1 (Kr2mila1) said to have been situated on the bank of the Gan3ga1. The river is now at a short distance from the villages of Valgu1dar and Rajauna, on the site of which the ancient city stood.^132 M.S. Pandey^133 opposes the identification of Kr2mila1 with Valgu1dar on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence to prove this identification. Though Kr2mila1 is not referred to in early Pali literature, we find a city named Kr2mila1 mentioned in the An3guttara Nika1ya Commentary.^134 According to this commentary, the city stood on the bank of the Gan3ga1. But now-a-days, the Gan3ga1 flows at some distance from this region which may be due to a change in the course of the river during so many centuries. The city was not very important and may have gradually disappeared. At present we do not find  any traces of the city: it may have been washed away by the Gan3ga1. According to Pandey^135 the name of the modern village Kiul has some resemblance with the name Kr2mila1 and it is not unlikely that the city may have been somewhere in that locality. Sircar is himself not sure about the identification of Kr2mila1 with Valgu1dar^136 and seems to prefer the claim of modern Kawali not being far from Valgu1dar Kr2mila1.^137 But in the district Gazetteer of Monghyr it is the village of Kiul which is mentioned and not Kawali. Hence we prefer the view of Dr. Pandey. The word Kr2mila1 means “a fruitful woman” or “a place full of worms” and the word Kr2mi forming its first part is sometimes also written as Krimi.^138

लाट
5. La1t2a^139 (No. 17, L. 3) The district or vis2aya of La1t2a is here described as “pleasing with choice trees that are bowed down by the weight of (their) flowers, and with temples and assembly-halls of the gods, and with viha1ras, (and) the mountains of which are covered over with vegetation”. The country south of Mahi1 or at times south of the Narbada1 up to the Pu1rva or so far as Daman, was called La1t2a and ‘it corresponded roughly with Southern Gujarat’.^140 It comprised the collectorates of Surat, Bharoch, Kheda and parts of Baroda territory.^141 According to Prof. Bu7hler, La1t2a is Central Gujarat, the district between the Mahi1 and Kim rivers and its chief city was Broach.^142 La1t2a has been identified with Central and Southern Gujarat in the Rewah Stone Inscription of Karn2a.^143 We also find the La1t2a kingdom mentioned in other epigraphical records.^144 La1t2ara1s2t2ra^145 is identical with the old La1t2a kingdom of Gujarat, the capital city of which is stated in the Di1pavam3s4a to have been Sim3apura (Si1hapura).^146 In the early days of the imperial Guptas, the La1t2a country was formed into an administrative province in the La1t2avis2aya.^147 The S4aktisan3gam Tantra places the La1t2a country to the west of Avanti and to the northwest of Vidarbha.^148 La1t2a is the same as the Larike of Ptolemy which lay to the east of Indo-Scythia along the sea-coast.^149 The word La1t2a is  derived from Sanskrit Ra1s2t2ra.^150 The Na1gara bra1hman2as of La1t2a (Gujarat) are said to have invented the Na1gari1 character which is believed to have been derived from the Bra1hmi1 alphabet.^151

वैव्य
6. Vaivya^152 (No. 40, L. 4): In this inscription the vis2aya of Vaivya is mentioned. The word Vaivya is inexplicable. We may, however, suggest that the term was possibly derived from Prakrit Vevva^153 which means ‘fear’ and hence Vaivya would mean ‘fearful’ or ‘dreadful’. Place-names ending in Man2d2ala

मण्डल
Man2d2ala Man2d2ala is a territorial unit which is found in the inscriptions of many dynasties of the early medieval period. Originally it denoted in the Arthas4a1stra and other legal texts,^154 a diplomatic circle of twelve neighbouring kings, some friendly and others unfriendly, in relation to a king desirous of conquest. The term could also be used for the territory under the possession of a feudatory. But in the Gupta period man2d2ala is used for some kind of administrative division though in early medieval period its use was in feudalistic association.^155 In Ca1lukyan records, the governor of a man2d2ala was usually called a Man2d2ales4vara or Maha1man2d2ales4vara.^156 In the records of the Imperial Guptas it denoted a unit smaller than a Vi1thi1.^157 Literally meaning a circle or round it denotes a district, province, country in general or it may signify a surrounding district or neighbouring state.^158

नागिरट्टमण्डल
1. Na1girat2t2aman2d2ala (No. 28, LL. 1-2): Na1girat2t2aman2d2ala formed a part of Daks2in2a1m3s4akavi1thi in Pun2d2ravardhana, the headquarters of the province of the same name. Mu1la-Na1girat2t2a seems to have formed the headquarters of the Na1girat2t2aman2d2ala^159 Na1girat2t2a is a Prakritic form of Na1gara1s2t2ra.

उत्तरमण्डल
2. Uttaraman2d2ala (No. 52, L. 7): Literally it means ‘the Northern Man2d2ala’. The province might have been divided into four man2d2alas in the four directions from the point of view of administration. The village Ka1nted2adaka is described to have formed a part of the Uttaraman2d2ala as mentioned in the record.^160  Place-names with the suffix Prades4a

प्रदेश
Prades4a Fleet translates it as ‘place’^161 but the term has a specific use as an administrative division. Here it connotes a division^162 or may correspond with the word vis2aya used in the same context in the Eran2 Stone Boar Inscription of Torama1n2a.^163 In modern usage prades4a signifies a province. In our inscriptions we find only one place-name termed as Prades4a.

ऐरिकिण
Airikin2a (No. 2, L. 25): It has been described here as the bhoga-nagara of the king (svabhoga-nagara).^164 In this context the use of the phrase ‘Svabhoganagara’ is important. K.P. Jayaswal^165 interprets ‘sva bhoganagara’ as a town that had, since the victory scored by the Gupta king at Eran2, become his direct personal possession. Fleet translates it as ‘the city of his own enjoyment’.^166 Das4aratha Sharma^167 explains it as analogous to the word ‘Ekabhoga’ defined in the Ma1nasa1ra as a town or village inhabited by a single land-holder along with his dependants.^168 It is ‘Svabhoga’ for the master and ‘Ekabhoga’ for others’. Sharma connects this ‘Svabhoga’ with a feudatory ‘who lived therein with his family and dependants, and on whom Samudragupta, pleased by his ‘devotion’, policy, and valour’ conferred the litle of Ra1jan and the accompanying glories of consecration, etc. described in verse 4.^169 But Sharma seems to be incorrect in associating the inscription with a feudatory, the inscription belongs to Samudragupta himself which is clear by further description in subsequent verses.^170 No doubt in the Eran2 Stone Boar Inscription of Torama1n2a^171 the word ‘sva-vis2aya’ an adjectival clause of Airikin2a is used to refer to a feudatory, which is very clear from the inscription. The editor^172 also, following Sharma, is misled and explains the term ‘Svabhoga’ as implying a grant, or something like it by the governor of the province, who had for his own salary the revenues of the city of Airikin2a allotted to him.^173 But the term ‘Svabhoganagara’ is significant in connoting royal status, higher than that of a feudatory chief and can mean ‘the capital city’ where the king himself was residing. In contrast, in the Earn2 Stone Boar Inscription of Torama1n2a^174 the  term ‘Sva-vis2aya’ has been used for the feudatory Dhanyavis2n2u (of king Torama1n2a) who may have been a vis2ayapati, the administrator-incharge of Eran2. Airikin2a is the same as modern Eran2, the ancient Airikin2a, a village on the left bank of the Bina, in Sagar District of Madhya Pradesh. From the Copper Coins of the As4okan period found at Eran2, we get an earlier Pali or Prakrit form of the name which is Erakan5a or Erakana or Erakan2a.^175 It is thus clear that Erakan5a or Erakan2a is the simplified form of Erikin2a: to simplify still more the medial letter ‘k’ has been dropped by the process of elision.^176 The meaning of the word Erikin2a is a puzzle but its connexion with eraka1 ‘a kind of grass,^177 found in that area may be accepted as a hypothesis. Place-names ending in Des4a

देश
Des4a It means a province, country, kingdom.^178 Sometimes it is used as a technical territorial term. But its exact meaning and bearing are difficult to explain due to the fact that sometimes it is described as bigger and at others smaller than other geographical divisions, such as man2d2ala, ra1s2t2ra and vis2aya.^179 We find only one reference each in the Bra1hman2as^180 and the Va1jasaneyi1 Sam3hita1.^181 The passage in the Va1jasaneyi1 Sam3hita1 is significant in as much as here for the first time, des4a is used in the sense of a ‘country’. We find a reference to the river Sarasvati1 as flowing in the Madhyades4a or ‘Middle Country’. The term was much in vogue in the Upanis2ad and Su1tra period denoting therein the meaning ‘land’.

म्लेच्छदेश
1. Mleccha-des4a (No. 14, L. 4): There is a mention of the Mleccha countries in the Juna1gar2h Rock Inscription of Skandagupta (No. 14). But the record does not refer to any boundary of the Mlecchas.^182

सुकुलिदेश
2. Sukuli-des4a (No. 5, L. 4): It will literally mean ‘a country possessing noble families in it’. It seems to have been a place near Sa1n5ci1 in Madhya Pradesh. Place-names ending in Ra1jya

राज्य
Ra1jya Ra1jya means a kingdom, country, realm (= ra1s2t2ra).^183  In the Vedic period the term ‘Ra1jya’ regularly denoted sovereign power. In addition to this there were other expressions referring to sovereign power.^184 In the ritual of the Ra1jasu1ya, the Aitareya Bra1hman2a^185 gives a whole series of terms: Ra1jya, Sa1mra1jya, Bhaujya, Sva1ra1jya, Vaira1jya, Pa1rames2t2hya, and Ma1ha1ra1jya. We find only one name ending with this suffix in our inscriptions which is given below:

ऐरावतगोराज्य
Aira1vata-go-ra1jya (No. 35, L. 9): The name is not clearly legible. But D.C. Sircar takes the reading to be ‘Aira1vata-go-ra1jye’. Aira1vata-go-ra1jya may literally mean ‘a kingdom where elephants and cows are found’.^186 It was situated in the vis2aya of Kot2ivars2a which formed a part of the Pun2d2ravardhana bhukti.^187 Place-names ending in Vi1thi

वीथि
Vi1thi It is spelt both as vi1thi and vi1thi1 and means a row, line, road, way or street.^188 But in the inscription it has been used to refer to an administrative division. It seems to have been smaller than a vis2aya (district) and bigger than a man2d2ala.^189 We find only one name with this suffix in one inscription which is given below:

दक्षिणांशकवीथि
Daks2in2a1m3s4aka-vi1thi (No. 28, L. 1): Literally it means ‘a road forming the southern part’ of the city. It seams to have formed part of the Pun2d2ravardhana district and Na1girat2t2aman2d2ala was included in it.^190 Place-names with the suffix Patha

पथ
Patha (footpath) ‘Patha’ in Zend. The sanskrit spelling (th) is loaned from Iran. Greek relatives are patos (path) and pontos (mariners' path, sea-route: sea). Initial p is dropped in old Irish: pathin (path) and pons (bridge) recur as ath (ford)’. Russian pant (path) and pent (ford).^191  Monier Williams derives it from §panth to go, to move. It means a way, path, a road or route.^192 In the Samara1n3gan2asu1tradha1ra^193 we find the word ‘Jan3gha1-patha (foot-path)’. The suffix ‘patha’ has been used as early as the later Vedic period.^194 Originally patha meant ‘a path’, ‘a road’ but later on it came to denote ‘a country’. Even now-a-days, the suffix ‘road’ is used for inhabitations and localities. Following are the place-names ending in this suffix:

आद्यपथ
(1) A1dyapatha (No. 43, L. 23): It was situated to the east of a village called Gulmagandhika1.^195 Literally A1dyapatha means ‘the first route’. It seems to have beena small area like a mohalla.

दक्षिणापथ
(2) Daks2in2a1patha (No. I, L. 20): According to inscription No. 1 all the kings of the region of the north were conquered by Samudragupta who attained great fame by liberating them.^196 The kingdoms specifically named as included in the southern region are: Kosala, Maha1ka1nta1ra, Kura1l2a, Pis2t2apura, Kot2t2u1ra, Eran2d2apalla, Ka1n5ci1, Avamukta, Ven3gi1, Palakka, Devara1s2t2ra and Kusthalapura.^197 “The earliest epigraphical mention of the Daks2in2a1patha is found in the Na1na1ghat2 Cave Inscription (Second half of first Century B.C.)^198 It later appears in the Juna1gar2h Rock Inscription of Rudrada1man (A.D. 150)^199 as also in the Nasik Cave Inscription of Va1sis2t2hi1putra Puluma1vi (A.D. 149).^200 Literally it means ‘the path or road leading to the south’ and in short the ‘south country’. As a designation of the Deccan,^201 the term is found as early as the Baudha1yana Dharmasu1tra.^202 A similar expression is Daks2in2a1 pada1, ‘with southward foot’, occurring in the R2gveda,^203 and refers to the place to which exiles are expelled.^204 Thus the term denoted ‘South’ beyond the limits of the recognised A1ryan world. In the Buddhist literature originally the name seems to have been restricted to a remote settlement on the Upper Goda1vari1.^205 Some hold that it was situated to the south of the Narbada1 and was identical with the Dakhinabades of the Greeks.^206 According to the Ya1davapraka1s4a, Daks2in2a1patha is the name of the country to the south of the Vindhyas and includes Pa1n2d2ya, Kuntala, Cola, Maha1ra1s2t2ra, Kerala, Kulya, Setuja,  Kulaka1laka, Is2i1ka, S4abara, A1rat2t2a and other countries.^207 Ra1jas4ekhara places it ahead of Ma1his2mati1. Countries situated in it are: Maha1ra1s2t2ra, Ma1his2aka, As4maka, Vidarbha, Kuntala, Krathakais4ika, Su1rpa1raka, Ka1n5ci1, Kerala, Kavera, Murala, Vanava1saka, Sim3hala, Cod2a, Dan2d2aka, Pa1n3d2ya, Pallava, Ga1n3ga, Na1s4ikya, Kon3kan2a Kollagiri, Vallara, etc.^208 Thus we see that Daks2in2a1patha in later times came to represent more or less the whole of the south. Place-names with the suffix Pura

पुर्
Pur or Pura Pur is a word of frequent occurrence in the R2gveda.^209 The early Vedic A1ryans were not city builders. Puras^210 which are mentioned from the context seem to have been always associated with the dasyus and the enemies of the A1ryans.^211 Pura, the oldest Sanskrit word denoting city, is usually derived from the Dravidian ur. From what we read in the R2gveda about Puram3dara's exploits in connection with the destruction of the ninety-nine puras of the Asuras who had been causing havoc to the gods, these puras seem to refer to the cities of the Indus Valley pre-A1ryans.^212 But the word ur is not available in Dravidian lexicons: on the contrary it is pura which is mentioned by them.^213 The word ur is not to be traced in the I. E. languages.^214 We find Ur only as the name of a town in Babylonia.^215 In Tamil country, in the inscriptions of the Chola dynasty (A.D. 900-1300) the word ‘ur’ is used to refer to ‘The Primary Assembly of the villagers’ in the case of ordinary villages while in the same context the word Sabha1 is used in case of Agraha1ra villages, mostly tenanted by learned bra1hman2as.^216 In the later Vedic literature^217 the word Pur meant ‘rampart’, ‘fort’, or ‘stronghold’. The meaning of Pura as ‘city’ developed later and was not at all in vogue in the Vedic literature. Lexicons define it as a place containing large buildings surrounded by a ditch and extending not less than one Kos4a in length, if it extends for half that distance it is called a khet2a; if less than that, a karvat2a or small market town, any smaller cluster of houses is called a gra1ma or village.^218 The Sama ra1n3gan2asu1tradha1ra describes puras as being of three kinds -Big, middle and small which have different measurements for their ditches, buildings, streets and road-ways.^219 The big one possesses a circumference of four thousand arcs, the middle of two thousand arcs and the small of one thousand arcs.^220 T. Burrow derives pura from §pri to fill Piparti ‘fills’: pur ‘city’: Lithuanian pilis (l becomes r).^221 We find the word being spelt in two ways pur^222 and pura^223 Pur (city), from puru (much) and pu1rn2a (full) means ‘plentitude’ or multitude of settlers. Similarly Greek polis (city) from poly (much): Latin populus (population, people) from plenus (full), and English folk from full. Pur is the city and purus2a the citizen. Greek polites (citizens), is preserved in politics (civic concerns), police (city administration), and cosmopolitan (citizen of the world): Lithuanian pilis (fort, castle).^224 In modern times the word pura1 (from pura) is used for mohalla in India. It seems to be the result of Muslim contact.^225 Pura, where it does not retain the original from pur, is changed into the following^226: (a) Wa1r: as Purushapura, Peshawar; Nalapura, Narwar; Matipura, Madwa1r; S4alwapura, Alwar; Candrapura, Candwar. (b) Urs or ur, as Ma1ya1pura, Mayura; Sim3hapura, Sin3gur; Jus2kapura, Zukur (c) Or, as Traipura, Tcor; Candra1dityapura, Caindor (d) Ora, as Ilbalapura, Ellora (e) Ore, as Lavapura, Lahore (f) Ola, as A1ryapura, Aihole (g) ar, as Kusumapura, Kumra1r (h) aur, as Siddhapura, Siddhaur (i) Own, as Hiran2yapura, Hindoun or Herdoun There are many names with the suffix Pura in the As2t2a1dhya1yi1, Patan5jali's Maha1bha1s2ya and the Ka1s4ika1.^227 The word Maha1pura in the Yajurveda Sam3hita1s^228 and the Bra1hman2as^229 denotes a great fortress. Probably the only difference between the Pur and Maha1pura was in their size.^230 Following are the place-names ending in the suffix pura:

अजपुर
(1) Ajapura (No. 12, L. 25): In Inscription No. 12, we find the mention of the town of Aja pura. The name of the vis2aya of which it was a part has been damaged. Since the column bearing the inscription was originally found in front of the northern gate of the odl fort of Bihar,^231 we can easily identify Ajapura with the modern village of the same name in the Ra1jagr2ha vis2aya which is not very far from Na1landa1.^232 The name of the vis2aya which included this town can possibly be restored as Ra1jagr2ha in the damaged part of the inscription.

चन्द्रापुर
(2) Candra1pura^233 (No. 16, L. 5): It is the name of Indrapura. See Indrapura.

दशपुर
(3) Das4apura (No. 17, L. 4, L. 16): In this inscription L. 4 refers to the migration of a guild of silkweavers from La1t2a vis2aya (Central and Southern Gujarat) to the city of Das4apura. The guild came to this city attracted by the virtues of its kings.^234 The inscription refers itself to the reign of king Kuma1ragupta, under whom Bandhuvarman, the son of Vis4vavarman^235 was the governor at Das4apura. L. 16 of the inscription records that it was under the governorship of Bandhuvarman (in Ma1lava era 493 = A.D. 437)^236, that a lofty temple of the Sun-god was caused to be built by the guild of silk-cloth weavers at Das4apura.^237 Afterwards, under other kings, part of this temple fell into disrepair. And then it was restored by the same guild in the year 529 of the Ma1lava era (= A.D. 473).^238 Das4apura has been identified with Mandasor in Western Malwa^239 formerly in the Gwalior State. The ancient Das4apura stood on the north or left bank of the Siwana, a tributary of the river S4ipra1.^240 We also find it mentioned in the Mandasor Fragmentary Inscription of the time of A1dityavardhana (A.D. 490-500).^241 Under the Imperial Guptas the use of the Ma1lava or the Kr2ta era seems to have been confined to Das4apura.^242 Thus Das4apura may have been the main city of the Western Ma1lavas. We also get a reference to Das4apura in the Br2hatsam3hita1^243 and the Meghadu1ta^244 of Ka1lida1sa. The ancient Sanskrit name Das4apura also occurs in an early Nasik inscription of Us2avada1ta,^245 and in one inscription of Vikram Sam3vat 1321 (= A.D. 1264) from Mandasor itself.^246 There are two explanations of the name Das4apura or Dasor. The local explanation is that the place was originally a city of  the Puranic king Das4aratha. But, on this view, the name of the city should have been Das4arathapura or Dasrathore. Fleet points out that even now, the township includes some twelve to fifteen outlying hamelets or divisions (Khilcipur, Janku1pura1, Ra1mpuriya1, Candrapura1, Ba1lagan5ja, etc.) and that ‘when it was originally constituted, it included exactly ten (das4a) such hamlets (pura)’.^247 This view of Fleet is more appealing. Mandasor, the full form of the name of the town by which it is officially known and which is entered in maps, is also explained in two ways: As suggested by Bhagwan Lal Indraji, it may represent Manda-Das4apura, “the distressed or afflicted Das4apura,” referring to the overthrow of the town, and the destruction of the Hindu temples in it, by the Musalmans, in memory of which, even to the present day, the Na1gar bra1hman2as of the area do not drink water there. This is supported by the fact that some pan2d2its still call it Mannadasor.^248 F.S. Growse suggests that the name combines the two names of Mad and Das4apura: the former^249 being the name of a village (also called Afzalpur) about eleven miles south-east of Mandasor, from which, it is said, were brought, from ruined Hindu temples, the stones that were used in the construction of the Musalman fort at Mandasor.^250 It is very difficult to choose between the two explanations, but the second seems to be more reasonable.

इन्द्रपुर
(4) Indrapura (No. 16, L. 5, L. 6, L. 7, L. 8): The inscription states that an endowment was given by a bra1hman2a named Devavis2n2u for the maintenance of a lamp in a temple of the Sun established by the merchants of the town of Indrapura ks2atriyas named Acalavarman and Bhrukun2t2hasim3ha at Indrapura. In line 5 we get ‘Candra1puraka-Padma1’ as the reading taken by Fleet^251 and he thus considers it a separate town than Indrapura.^252 But the correct reading should be as ‘Cendrapuraka-Padma1’, since we find a small stroke by the left side of ‘c’. The stroke in other lines for ‘e’ is very clear (e. g. in L. 2) though it is not very clear in L. 5 still we cannot read it simply ‘c’. The reading ‘ce’ for ‘c’ has been suggested by Sircar and Jagannath.^253 Thus we see that the Padma1 referred in line 5  of this inscription also belongs to Indrapura. Now we find two different spellings of Indra1pura in lines 5 and 6 and Indrapura in lines 7 and 8.^254 What we can find out here is that the affix ‘ka’ in lines 5 and 6 is very important which seems to have grammatically a succinct purpose here. The vr2ddhi of the first vowel ‘i’ was desirable here as is also clear by the use of affix ‘ka’ in the Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.^255 So it is a weaker form of the affix ‘ka’, without vr2ddhi of the vowel in the first syllable.^256 The writer seems to have used the long vowel (with the last syllable of Indra) instead of vr2ddhi in the first syllable to avoid confusion between Aindrapura and Indrapura. We do not find any such example of the elongation of vowel in the classical Sanskrit literature though we find its rare use in Vedic literature.^257 So we shall translate ‘Indra1puraka Padma1’ as ‘Padma1 of (the town of) Indrapura and ‘Indrapurakavan2igbhya1m’ as ‘merchants of (the town of) Indrapura’. This Indrapura is the same as modern Indor,^258 near Dibha1i, Bulandshahr district, U.P.^259 The ancient town of Indrapura was situated on a large and lofty mound about five miles to the north-west of Dibha1i.^260 Now-a-days it is only a khed2a1 or deserted mound, and is not shown in maps^261

कर्तृपुर
(5) Kartr2pura (No. I, L. 22): Though the most accepted and correct reading is Kartr2pura, some scholars prefer to read Katr2ipura^262 or Ka1tripura.^263 It is one of the five frontier kingdoms^264 mentioned in the inscription whose kings did homage and paid tribute to Samudragupta. Scholars differ in their views about the identification of this place-name: According to smith,^265 this kingdom ‘occupied the lower ranges of the western Himalayas, including probably Kumaon, Garhwal, and Kangra’. Oldham^266 holds that the kingdom of Ka1tripura, included Kumaun, Almora, Garhwal and Kangra. Fleet^267 suggests that the name may survive in Kartarpur in the Jullundur district. We prefer the view of Das4aratha Sharma.^268 His contention is that amongst the five frontier kingdoms mentioned in the inscription, the first three belong to the East, the fourth one belongs to the North, hence it will be better to leave aside  the northern and eastern sides of the empire and to look for Kartr2pura somewhere to the west of the Gupta dominions. Consequently he finds Karor or Karu1r to be a good equivalent for Kartr2pura.^269 Kara here stands for Kartr2 and ‘ur’ or ‘u1r’ would stand here for pura.^270 Karu1r, again, is to be perferred to the other alternatives on account of its associations with the Gupta period of Indian History. According to Al-Beruni, an eastern king, called Vikrama1ditya, put to flight and killed a S4aka ruler in the region of Karu1r, between Multan and Loni.^271 This Vikrama1ditya is to be identified with Candragupta II ‘the enemy of the S4akas’, who disguised as his brother's wife, Dhruvasva1mini1, ‘ripped upon the belley of the S4aka ruler’, and destroyed the S4aka army, most probably, in Kartr2pura or Karu1r.^272 This was the first encounter between the S4akas and Vikrama1ditya, and Karu1r, Karor, or Kartr2pura was the theatre of the war because of its intermediate position between the S4aka dominions and the Gupta empire.^273

क्रीपुर
(6) Kri1pura (No. 52, L. 1): Kri1pura was the place from which Vainyagupta issued his landgrant in A.D. 507-08, was evidently the seat of his government.^274 It was the victorious camp full of great ships and elephants and horses (situated).^275 The place is of unknown identity,^276 but is possibly to be looked for in Bengal.^277 Literally the name can mean a ‘market-town’.

कुस्थलपुर
(7) Kusthalapura (No. I, L. 20): Kusthalapura ruled by Dhanan5jaya is mentioned as one of the Daks2in2a1patha kingdoms subdued by Samudragupta. Smith takes it to be a mistake for Kus4asthalapura,^278 and identifies it with the holy city of Dwarka, the capital of A1nartta, i. e. North Gujarat.^279 Raj Bali Pandey also identifies it with Kus4asthali1 (Dwarka)^280 G. Ramdas locates the place in Gujarat following Smith.^281 Monier Williams also indentifies Kus4asthala with the town of Dwarka.^282 Bhandarkar, following Barnett identifies the place with Kuttalur near Polur in North Arcot.^283 This Kus4asthali1 is not situated in Gujarat but presumably on the eastern spurs of the Vindhya range near Daksin2akosala.^284 It was the capital of Kus4a, son of Ra1macandra.^285 But its  position in the list of the States of Daks2in2a1patha indicates a place a little more to the south. By the process of Haplology,^286 Kus4asthalapura is simplified into Kusthalapura which may be changed to Kus4asthali1 or Kus4a1vati1 in short. The suffix sthala or sthali1 is significant: it suggests a highlying country, an eminence, tableland, or dry-land as opposed to a damp low-land.^287 The Maha1bha1rata, Harivam3s4a, early Jain and Pali literature use the word in this sense.^288 The Maha1bha1rata mentions both Kus4asthala as well as kus4a-sthali1. The latter is supposed to be another name of Dwarka.^289

पाटलिपुत्र
(8) Pa1t2aliputra (No. 7, L. 12; No. 6, L. 4; No. 1, L. 14): It is the same as modern Patna situated to the south of the river Gan3ga1. Inscription No. 7 refers to Pa1t2aliputra. Inscription No. 6 mentions Vi1rasena, the child of Kutsa, the minister for peace and war under Candragupta II, who knew the meanings of the words, and logic, and (the ways of) mankind, who was a poet and who belonged to (the city of) Pa1t2aliputra.^290 Inscription No. 1 mentions a city named Pus2pa where Samudragupta enjoyed playfully while he was young.^291 Apparently, the city was the Gupta capital. We also find the word Pa1t2aliputa (Pa1t2aliputra) used by As4oka, in his rock edicts.^292 The city was also known as Kusumapura due to the abundance of flowers.^293 Its name Pus2papura is also met with in the Raghuvam3s4a.^294 It is mentioned in the Mudra1ra1ks2asa as well.^295 The Katha1saritsa1gara of Somadeva^296 (11th century) describes it as a place of both wealth and education though generally there is a fight between S4ri1 (laks2mi1) and Sarasvati1.^297 The Ka1vyami1ma1m3sa1 of Ra1jas4ekhara (A.D. 900) mentions a tradition that there were assemblies of scholars called brahmasabha1s, organised by kings, which examined poets like Ka1lida1sa, Bhartr2man2t2ha, Amara, Ru1pa, A1ryas4u1ra, Bha1ravi and Candragupta in Vis4a1la1 (Ujjaini1) and where such great masters of grammar as Upavars2a, Pa1n2ini, Pin3gala, Vya1d2i, Vararu1ci and Patan5jali were examined in Pa1t2aliputra and attained fame.^298 The Man5jus4ri1mu1lakalpa^299 (A.D. 800) mentions Pa1t2aliputra as Nandanagara. This work refers to king Nanda, his learned Council of bra1hman2a philosophers and to his intimacy with Pa1n2ini. “After him (Su1rasena) there will be king Nanda  at Pus2pa city. In the capital of the Magadha residents there will be bra1hman2a controversialists and the king will be surrounded by them. The king will give them riches. His minister was a Buddhist bra1hman2a, Vararu1ci, who was of high soul, kind and good. His great friend was a bra1hman2a, Pa1n2ini by name”.^300 The Ka1s4ika1^301 records two divisions of Pa1t2aliputra: 1. Pu1rva-Pa1t2aliputra (eastern on the Gan3ga1) 2. Apara-Pa1t2aliputra (western on the S4on2a) Patan5jali^302 mentions the western Pa1t2aliputra. A citizen of Pa1t2aliputra was called Pa1t2aliputraka.^303 The city is named as Palibothra by Megasthenes, the Ambassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of King Candragupta Maurya.^304 The Pa1la inscriptions refer to it by the name S4ri1nagara.^305 The termination ‘Putra’ in Pa1t2aliputra is difficult to explain. We find it being used with ‘Brahman’ to denote the river ‘Brahmaputra’. As regards places-names we find the mention of Saitya puta (Satiya-putra) and Kerala-puta (Kerala putra) in As4okan Rock-edicts.^306 The name Pa1t2aliputra is taken to mean “the son (putra) of Pa1t2ali, i. e. the trumpet flower. The words Pus2papura and Kusumapura also mean ‘a city of flowers’. The word ‘S4ri1nagara’ means ‘a beautiful city.^307 Because of the abundance of flowers the city may have looked beautiful. It was known by other names also, viz., Pus2papura, Puspapuri1 and Kusumapura.^308 According to Yuan-Chwang, it had been called Kusumapura (K' u-su-mo-pu-lo) on account of the numerous flowers (kusuma) in the royal enclosure.^309 Later its glory was replaced by that of Ka1nyakubja which came to be known as Kusumapura.^310 The meaning of ‘Pa1t2aliputra’ is explained in the legendary origin of the city. According to the legend: there was a bra1hman2a of high talent and singular learning. Many flocked to him to receive instruction. One day all his students went out on a tour of observation. One of them looked very sad. When asked, he told that his life was waning without any company. In a joke his friends made the Pa1t2ali tree, under which they were standing, his father-in-law: in other words he was to marry the daughter of the tree, or a Pa1t2ali flower  (Bignonia Suaveloens).^311 As the Sun was about to set, all the students proposed to return home but the young student fascinated by love stayed there fearlessly. Accidentally, next day he was married with the young daughter of an old couple. After a year his wife gave birth to a son. He declined to stay there fearing the exposure to wind and weather. But the old man (the father of the wife) constructed a house for him and made him stay there. When the old capital of Kusumapura was changed, this town was chosen, and “as the genie built the mansion for the youth the country was named as Pa1t2aliputrapura (the city of the son of the Pa1t2ali tree).”^312 It is not unlikely that originally the name of the city was Pa1t2aliputrapura and that later suffix Pura was dropped. The Buddhist literature informs us that Pa1t2aliputra was originally a village known as Pa1t2aliga1ma. Aja1tas4atru is said to have fortified it in order to check the attacks of the Licchavis who often harassed its inhabitants. The Buddha on his way from Ra1jagr2ha to Vais4a1li1, passed through this village on his last journey and is said to have predicted that the village was destined to become a great city.^313 The Va1yu-Pura1n2a attributes the real foundation of Pa1t2aliputra to Ra1ja1 Aja1ta-S4atru's grandson, Udaya or Udaya1s4va. It was he who first removed the capital from Ra1jagr2ha to Pa1t2aliputra (during the last part of the 6th century B.C.)^314 Pa1t2aliputra had closely been associated with multifarious political and cultural activities right from the fifth century B.C. to the later part of the sixth century A.D.^315 It had the honour to be the capital of the S4ais4una1gas, the Nandas, the Mauryas and the great Imperial Guptas uptil the Hu1n2a invasion in the 6th century A.D. when it was ruined. Hars2avardhana (7th century A.D.) made no attempt to restore it.^316 S4as4a1n3ka Narendragupta destroyed many Buddhist temples and monasteries at Pa1t2aliputra.^317 Dharmapa1la, the most powerful of the Pa1la kings of Bengal and Bihar, tried to restore its glory.^318 Coming to medieval times, we find that it remained deserted for a number of centuries. It was Sher Shah, who, in about A.D. 1541 occupied it again as a royal city and built a fort there. It then came into importance under its modern name Patna (from Skt. Pattana) i. e. the town or city. It is even now  the capital of Bihar.^319

पिष्टपुर
(9) Pis2t2apura (No. 1, L. 19): It has been mentioned as one of the southern regions which were first caputred and then liberated by Samudragupta.^320 Mahendragiri is mentioned as its king. Pis2t2apura is the same as the fortress Pis2t2apura captured by the Ca1lukya king Pulakes4in II. The Ta1n2d2iva1da grant of Pr2thivi1 Maha1ra1ja also refers to Pis2t2apura.^321 Pis2t2apura is modern Pithapuram in the Godavari district of the Madras Presidency.^322 It was the capital of Kalin3ga.^323 ‘Kalin3ga1dhipati’ Anantavarman issued a grant^324 from the victorious city of Pis2t2apura. This grant records that Anantavarman's grandfather Gun2avarman ruled over Devara1s2t2ra with Pis2t2apura as its chief city.^325 In our inscription Devara1s2t2ra^326 has been treated separately. It seems that during Samudragupta's time these two States (Devara1s2t2ra and Kalin3ga) were separate states but later on under Gun2avarman they were amalgamated. Guha ruled over the whole of Kalin3ga and the neighbouring regions.^327 Guha belonged to the Sa1lan3ka1yana family of bra1hman2as. Samudragupta installed him as his viceroy in Kalin3ga.^328 Guha was already reigning over Kalin3ga (with his capital at Pis2t2apura) when Samudragupta conquered him and placed him as his feudatory. ‘Mahendragiri’ may have been another name given to him on account of the extension of his dominion over the Mahendra mountain.^329 It is interesting to note that Ka1lida1sa^330 refers to Raghu defeating a king named Mahendrana1tha in the course of his southern campaign. It is tempting to connect Mahendrana1tha with Mahendragiri. After the victory of Samudragupta, Guha was confirmed in the enjoyment of sovereignty under the imperial tutelage.^331 At Pis2t2apura there is a Vais2n2ava temple named Kuntima1dhava.^332 We get references to Pis2t2apuri1 or Pis2t2apurika1devi1, a form at Ma1napura, of the goddess Laks2mi1, in the inscriptions of the Privra1jaka Maha1ra1jas and the Maha1ra1jas of Uccakalpa during the Gupta period.^333 This must be a local form of some popular goddess at Pis2t2apura itself.^334  Place-names ending in the Suffix Nagara

नगर
Nagara: Nagara means a town, a city.^335 we find the term being used by Pa1n2ini (IV. 2. 142).^336 The word Na1garaka (or Na1garika)^337 also occurs in Sanskrit literature as standing for ‘an inhabitant of a town’ but sometimes its use was restricted for the chief of a town or a police-officer. In modern times na1garika is used to refer to ‘a citizen of a state whether living in city or village’. In the early Vedic literature Nagara is found only as the derivative adjective Nagarin, used as a proper name, but it appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka (1. 11, 18: 31, 4) and frequently in the later works.^338 Nagara is an important factor which helps us to distinguish Janapada from ra1s2t2ra: nagara forms a part of the ra1s2t2ra but is excluded from the Janapada.^339 Samara1n3gan2asu1tradha1ra uses Nagara and Pura as synonyms.^340 It is significant that the word Nagara is of late occurrence.^341 It is likely that in the early Vedic times city life does not seem to have developed much. In the Epic,^342 there are references to Nagara, ‘a city’: Gra1ma ‘Village’: and Ghos2a ‘ranch’. Vedic literature especially of the earlier period is generally confined to the village. The siege of puras is mentioned in the Sam3hita1s and Bra1hman2as. The word Nagara is changed into:^343 (a) Nar as Kus4i1nagara, Kusinar, Girinagara, Girnar (b) Ner as Ji1rn2anagara, Jooner. In modern times the suffix nagara is sometimes used to denote an inhabitation or Mohalla e. g. Tilak Nagar, Subhash Nagar, Patel Nagar, Jawahar Nagar, Lajapat Nagar. We do not find any place-name with the suffix ‘nagara’ in our records but with a little change in the same sense with the suffix nagari1, which is given below:

पञ्चनगरी
Pan5canagari1 (No. 44, L. 1): It was the chief town of the district, where Kulavr2ddhi's Court was situated.^344 D.C. Sircar considers it to be modern Pa1ncbibi in the Bogra District and the same as Pentapolis of Ptolemy.^345  Pan5canagari1 literally means ‘a multitude of five towns’. Five small localities might have been collected into one for the smoothness of administration. Place-names ending in Nauyoga

नौयोग
Nauyoga: Literally meaning ‘a place for parking boats’ it signifies ‘a harbour’. Following are the place-names which have been termed as ‘nauyoga’ or harbour.

चूडामणि
1. Cu1d2a1man2i^346 (No. 52, L. 28): Literally meaning ‘a jewel worn by men and women on the top of the head’ it denotes ‘the best or most excellent’.^347 Combined with its epithet nauyuga, Cu1d2a1man2i signifies ‘the best of harbours’.

नगरश्री
2. Nagaras4ri1 (No. 52, L. 28): Literally Nagaras2ri1 means ‘the glory of the town’. Combined with its epithet nauyoga it means ‘the harbour of Nagaras4ri1’. It seems to have been an important part of the town.

प्रडामार
3. Prad2a1ma1ra (No. 52, L. 29): It has also been described as a nauyoga.^348 The meaning of Prad2a1ma1ra is difficult to explain. It seems to be the Sanskritised form of the Prakrit Pad2a1ma1ra, i. e. a place where clothes or tents are found in abundance or it may signify ‘a harbour of “pa1la-boats”.^349 Place-names ending in Kat2aka

कटक
Kat2aka: It is formed from the root §kat2 to surround, to encompass, to cover and means a ‘royal camp’.^350 There is only one such place-name with the suffix ‘Kat2aka’ which is as follows: ...Kat2aka (No. 29, L. 12): The first part is not clearly legible. Sircar takes it to be bhra1tr2i^351 but does not seem to be correct as it yields no sense with the word Kat2aka. The donated land is mentioned to have been given to the Chandoga (Sa1mavedin) bra1hman2a Vara1ha-sva1min, an inhabitant of this Kat2aka.^352  Place-names ending in Va1saka

वासक
Va1saka: It means an abode or inhabitation.^353 An inhabitation can be big or small. In referring to a big inhabitation it denotes a city. Following are the names with this suffix:

आनन्दपुरवासक
(1) A1nandapurava1saka^354 (No. 40, L. 1): It has been mentioned as a camp of victory. A1nandapura literally means ‘a city of pleasure’. It has not been identified so far.

अयोध्या
(2) Ayodhya1 (No. 21, L. 1; No. 37, L. 6; No. 39, L. 10): In No. 21 the word ‘Ayodhya1-Va1saka’ occurs^355 while in No. 37 and 39 the word ‘A1yodhyaka’ has been mentioned. In No, 21, Ayodhya1 is described as a victorious camp. full of great ships, and elephants and horses. In No. 39 certain bra1hman2as belonging to Ayodhya1, living in the vicinity of Maha1deva S4ailes4vara are named and are mentioned as belonging to various gotras and caran2as, and as proficient in observants, in sacred duty, in the mantras, the su1tras, bha1s2yas and pravacanas.^356 It has been venerated as one of the most important and holy places of the Hindus.^357 Vini1ta1 was another name for this city.^358 Its other names including Vin2i1a1 (Vini1ta1) are mentioned in the Vividhati1rthakalpa.^359 Fa-Hsien calls it Sha-che and Ptolemy knew it as Sogeda.^360 Ayodhya1 and Sa1keta have been treated by many writers as being identical. Csoma de ko1ro7s^361 calls this place as “Sa1ketan or Ayodhya1” and H.H. Wilson in his dictionary, refers to Sa1keta as ‘the city of Ayodhya1’. Several passages in the Raghuvam3s4a^362 confirm it. The Vividhati1rthakalpa mentions Sa1keyam (Sa1keta) as a synonym for Ayodhya1,^363 but in the Buddhist literature we find separate references to Ayodhya1 and Sa1keta which creates doubt about their identity and suggests that the two existed separately.^364 V. Pathak quotes a well known verse occurring in the Yuga Pura1n2a, a section of Ga1rgi1 Sam3hita1,^365 to show that Sa1keta is the same as Ayodhya1. But there is nothing in the passage to support the view. The ancient city of Ayodhya1 or Sa1keta is described in the Ra1ma1yan2a as situated on the banks of the Sarayu1 or Sarju1 river.^366 During the Buddhist period, Ayodhya1 was divided into  Uttara (Northern) Kosala and Daks2in2a (Southern) Kosala. The river Sarayu1 was the dividing line between the two provinces. Ayodhya1 was the capital of the latter.^367 Ancient tradition believes it to have been built by Manu.^368 The history of Kos4ala, with its mighty King Prasenajit and his son Vidudabha pales into insignificance with the emergence of the Magadhan rulers as powerful antagonists. The Nandas, followed by the Mauryas, assimilated Kos4ala in their empire. Under the S4un3gas, it was being ruled by a viceroy. An inscription from Ayodhya1 mentions Pus2yamitra as having performed two horse-sacrifices. Under the Kus2a1n2as, the city remained more or less in oblivion. Subsequently in the Pura1n2as it figures along with Praya1ga and Magadha as forming part of the kingdom of the Guptas. The spurious Gaya1 Plate of Samudragupta (No. 21) mentions it as a seat of a Gupta camp of victory. The history of the city in the postGupta period is wrapped up in obscurity. It was within the empire of the Pratiha1ras and Ga1had2ava1las of Kanauj. Ayodhya1 is described by Muslim historians^369 to have been a wilderness. The Slaves and Khilji rulers held sway over it, and subsequently it received importance as the headquarters of Oudh. It was under the charge of Muslim governors appointed from Delhi, but with the emergence of Jaunpur as a strong kingdom Ayodhya1 was completely over-shadowed. It was a mint-town in the time of Akbar, but there is no reference to it in later Chronicles.^370 Ayodhya1 is important as a centre of pilgrimage. There are several places in the city connected with different events in the life of Ra1ma. Ra1ma was born at a place called Janmastha1na. At Chi1rodaka also called Chi1rasa1gara, Das4aratha performed, with the help of R2s2yas4r2n3ga R2s2i, the sacrifices for obtaining a son. At a place called Treta1-ka1-T2ha1kur, Ra1macandra performed the horse sacrifice by setting up the image of Si1ta1. At Ratnaman2d2apa, he held his Council,^371 at Swargadwa1ram in Fyzabad, his body was burnt. At Laks2man2a-kun2d2a, Laks2man2a disappeared in the river Sarayu1. Das4aratha accidentally killed S4ravan2a, the blind R2s2i's son, at Majhaura1 in the district of Fyzabad.^372 Ayodhya1 engaged the attention of the Muslim rulers some of  whom set up mosques here, of these the mosques of Babar and and Aurangzeb are notable.^373 At present this city forms a part of the district of Fyzabad.

ईश्वरवासक
(3) I1s4varava1saka (No. 5, L. 6)^374: It seems to be a village or an allotment of land granted by A1mraka1rddava, the son of Unda1na, and apparently an officer of Candragupta II to the A1ryasam3gha at the great viha1ra of Ka1kana1dabot2a for the purpose of feeding mendicants.^375 The word I1s4vara here is connected with Va1saka and there is no infix or place-name suffix in between (just as ‘pura’ in A1nandapurava1saka). Hence va1saka here has a double purpose. It is meaningful to I1s4vara and also denotes the inhabitation. The whole will literally mean ‘an inhabitation of God’.

वन
Place-names ending in Vana We find some place-names with the suffix denoting forest, for example Vindhya1t2avi1, and Vr2nda1vana. In our inscriptions we come across only three such names, Tumbavana and Vindha1t2avi1, and Maha1ka1nta1ra. The suffixes vana, at2avi1 and ka1nta1ra are synonyms. These are described below:

तुम्बवन
1. Tumbavana (No. 30, L. 6): It has been identified with Tumain in Guna district, the old Gwalior State, now in Madhya Pradesh. It is also mentioned in the Sa1n5ci1 Stu1pa inscription.^376 The Br2hatsam3hita1^377 refers to it as situated in the South. The name suggests that Tumba, the gourd Lagenaria vulgaris was in abundance at this place.

महाकान्तार
2. Maha1ka1nta1ra (No. 1, L. 19): It is one of the southern countries subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Vya1gharara1ja. Literally Maha1ka1nta1ra means ‘a great forest’. It has to be distinguished from Sarva1t2avi referred to later on in this inscription.^378 According to Krishnaswami Aiyangar,^379 it must have included the Saugar division of C.P. extending northwards to the Ajaigadh State in Bundelkhanda. But G. Ramdas differs from this view on the ground that Maha1ka1nta1ra must be sought in Southern India as it is specifically mentioned as one of the kingdoms of the South conquered by Samudragupta. He suggests that Maha1ka1nta1ra must be the same as Maha1vana, a forest region extending northwards into  Ganjam Agency and westwards into the tract formerly known as the Chatisgarh States of C.P.^380 This very region has been mentioned by the same name in the Ganj and Nachna inscriptions.^381

विन्ध्याटवी
3. Vindhya1t2avi1 (No. 28, L. 25): The name appears in one of the verses, quoted from ancient Smr2tis or the Maha1bha1rata asking people to honour land grants. In the present case it is said that a man who violates the grant is born in the Vindhya forest as a serpent and resides in the dry hollow of a tree.^382 Vindhya forest is the belt of forest at the foot of the Vindhya mountain. Place-names ending in Gra1ma

ग्राम
Gra1ma: It means an inhabited place, village, hamlet.^383 It seems that firstly the word gra1ma denoted the collective inhabitants of a place, community or race. Later on this sense was transferred to an inhabitation and was used in the sense of a village. The earlier usage of this word, which occurs frequently from the R2gveda^384 onwards, appears to have been in the sense of a village. The early A1ryans must have dwelt in villages which were scattered over the country, some close together, some far apart, and were connected by roads.^385 In the early Vedic literature village is regularly contrasted with the forest (a1ran2ya) in the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the forest.^386 The villages were probably open, though perhaps a fort(pur) might on occasion be built inside.^387 Presumably they consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (maha1gra1ma1h2) were known.^388 The gra1ma may, however, perhaps be regarded more correctly as an aggregate of several families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan (vis4), as is often the case at the present day.^389 The head of the village was called Gra1man2i or ‘the leader of the village’. The king's share in a village is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda.^390 Villages played an important role as a unit of Ra1s2t2ra or city.^391 Khet2a was the half of a city and the village was the  half of a khet2a.^392 Cities other than the capital are called Karvat2a, a little less is Nigama and lesser is gra1ma and still lesser is a house.^393 Gra1ma is changed into gaon,^394 as Suvarn2agra1ma, Sona1rgaon; Kalahagra1ma, Kahalgaon. Following are the place-name with this suffix. We have also included here some place-names which are villages though they have not been termed as such with this suffix.

भद्रपुष्करकग्राम
(1) Bhadrapus2karakagra1ma (No. 40, L. 5): Bhadra means ‘good or auspicious and Pus2kara (modern Pokhara) means ‘a pond or lake’. So literally the name would mean ‘a village possessing an auspicious or good pond’. It has not so far been identified.^395

भारडिदसमद
(2) Bha1rad2idasamada (No. 39, L. 11): It is the name of a village. The name of the place where the lin3ga containing the inscription was found is said to be Bha1ra1dhi1 D2i1h,^396 Bha1rad2i1 of our inscription may also be compared with ‘bharad2iya’ of the Sa1n5ci1 stu1pa inscription.^397 Samada is possibly Samudra, an epithet for Siva. D.C. Sircar takes ‘Samudra’ to be the ‘na1m-aika-des4a of a deity called Samuders4vara’ and suggests that the relevant passage is to be corrected as ‘pa1rago bharad2ida-samudres4vara’.^398 The meaning of the passage is difficult to explain.

छण्डग्राम
(3) Chan2d2agra1ma (No. 33, L. 3): The village is difficult to identify.^399 Can2d2a is the Prakritic form of Candra^400 which means ‘the moon’. Thus the village seems to have been named after the Moon-god. But Can2d2a may also mean ferocious or turbulent and in that case it may have been so named because of its wild looks or its violent population.

चित्रवातङ्गर
(4) Citrava1tan3gara^401 (No. 43, L. 24): It is the name of a village. Citra means ‘excellent’ or distinguished^402 and va1tan3gara (from va1tan3kara) means ‘producing wind’. Thus the whole will literally mean ‘which produces excellent wind or air’. The village might have been noted for its healthy and open atmosphere.

दोङ्गाग्राम
(5) Don3ga1-gra1ma (No. 34, L. 11; No. 36. L. 6): In No. 34 we get a reference to ‘Don3ga1’, but in No. 36, the name appears as Don3ga1-gra1ma.  The Don3ga1-gra1ma is said to have been situated in HimavacChikhara^403 identified with Bara1hachatra (Vara1haks2etra) in Nepal.^404 But scholars^405 are not right in co-relating Don3ga1gra1ma with Himavac-Chikhara, Inscription No. 36 clarifies it. There is a long gap between the references to HimavacChikhara and Don3ga1-gra1ma. Actually Himavac-Chikhara is associated with Koka1mukhasva1min (a form of the Boar incarnation of Vis2n2u) and S4vetavara1hasva1min where originally (a1dya) these gods were installed in a temple. The name Don3ga1-gra1ma is used for the place where the lands were donated by R2bhupa1la for the construction of the two temples having the names of the two deities.^406 The word ‘a1dya’ in L. 7 is significant and distinguishes the temples at Himavac-Chikhara from those at Don3ga1-gra1ma. The writer had to use the word ‘HimavacChikhara’ again in L. 10, with the names of Koka1mukhasva1min and S4vetavara1hasva1min in order to avoid confusion between the temples at the two places. For the temple at Don3ga1-gra1ma the writer uses the word ‘iha’ in L. 11. We also find the word ‘Himavac-Chikhara’ absent in another Da1modarpur Copper Plate Inscription of the Gupta Year 224 (= A.D. 543), where a person named Amr2tadeva hailing from Ayodhya1 donates a land for the repairs and worship, etc., at the temple of Lord S4vetavara1hasva1min obviously because he was referring to the temple at Don3ga1-gra1ma and there was now, no question of any confusion or distinction.^407 Thus Don3ga1gra1ma does not seem to have any connection with Himavac-Chikhara. This village is to be located somewhere near Da1modarpur and belonged to the Kot2ivars2a vis2aya as mentioned in the records.^408 But the village was most probably situated in a hilly area which is clear from the wrod Don3ga1 itself.^409 The word ‘Atra1ran2ye’ (local forest where the temple of S4vetavara1hasva1min was situated) in No. 37 also attests to it.^410 The village may have consisted of a few huts with bushes and trees all around or the place where the temples were situated was away from habitation. Thus the earlier suggestion that the Kot2ivars2a district included the hilly region bordering on the northern fringe of Bengal,^411 which was rejected by Sircar,^412 seems to be correct.

गोषाटपुञ्जक
6. Gos2a1t2apun5jaka (No. 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15):  In line 2 of the inscription the reading is Gos2a1t2apun5jaka while in lines 8 and 15 the reading is Gos2a1t2apun5ja. Gos2a1t2a may be the same as gos4a1la1 or a cow-stall^413 and pun5ja means a multitude.^414 So the village may have consisted of a multitude, of cow-stalls and thus resembled the villages known as goha1li1s.

गुल्मगन्धिका
7. Gulmagandhika1 (No. 43, LL. 1-2, L. 22): It is the name of a village. It occurs once in lines 1-2 and twice in L. 22.^415 Gulma means ‘a cluster of trees’^416 and gandhika1 means ‘having the smell of’.^417 The whole will literally mean ‘a place which is full of a cluster of trees having smell’. We may conjecture that the village originally possessed a few shrubs or small trees which produced fragrance.

गुणेकाग्रहारग्राम
8. Gun2eka1graha1ragra1ma (No. 52, LL. 18-19, L. 21): In lines 18-19 we get the reading ‘Gun2eka1graha1ragra1ma while in line 21 the reading is Gun2ika1graha1ragra1ma. The two names are identical and are the same as modern Gunaighar, 18 miles to the north-west of Comilla, Tippera district -Bengal, in East Pakistan^418 (now Bangla Desh). Sen considers it to have been a village-name ending with the term agraha1ra and suggests that from the standpoint of administration this division was more important and better developed than an ordinary gra1ma. The expression gra1ma1graha1ra^419 or agraha1ragra1ma refers to ‘a process of unification which some of the more fortunate villages underwent through pressure of administrative and economic necessities.^420 Agraha1ra (Prakrit agga1ha1ra) was a village,^421 or consisted of fields which were given to bra1hman2as.^422 The agraha1ras enjoyed exemption from several taxes and had other administrative immunities.

जम्बूदेव
9. Jambu1deva (No. 28, L. 2, LL. 7-8, L. 14): It was the name of a village. It seems that this locality was named after a person named Jambu1deva.^423

ककुभ
10. Kakubha (No. 15, L. 5): Inscription No. 15 informs us that five stone images of A1dikartr2is or Ti1rtham3karas were set up by Madra at the village of Kakubha. The village was sanetified by its association with holy men.^424 It was also known as Kakubhagra1ma,^425 the  suffix gra1ma seems to have been dropped in the present case. Kakubha is identified with modern Kaha1um or Kahawan, a village about five miles to the west by south of SalampurMajhauli, the chief town of the Salampur-Majhauli Pargan2a1 in the Deoria, Deoriya1 or Dewariya1 Tehsil or sub-division of the Gorakhpur district in Uttar Pradesh. The grey sandstone column on which the inscription is engraved stands at a short distance on the east of the village.^426

कान्तेडदकग्राम
11. Ka1nted2adaka gra1ma (No. 52, L. 7): It was a village situated in the division called Uttaraman2d2ala.^427 The name cannot be explained but the suffix ‘d2adaka’ also appears in the name here and Na1dad2adakagra1ma mentioned in line 27 of this inscription.

नादडदकग्राम
12. Na1dad2adaka gra1ma (No. 52, L. 27): It was situated in the Northern direction.^428 The name is difficult to explain.

लवङ्गसिका
13. Lavan3gasika1 (No. 37, L. 15): It is the name of a village based on the Lavan3ga (Clove) tree. Philologically in Lavan3gasika1 one ‘I’ has been dropped: the original and full form should have been ‘Lavan3galasika1’ i. e. ‘where Lavan3ga trees play’.

पूर्ण्णनागग्राम
14. Pu1rn2n2ana1ga gra1ma (No. 40, L. 5): The village belonged to a vis2aya called Kr2mila1 in Na1landa1, Patna district, Bihar. Literally Pu1rn2n2ana1ga means ‘full of serpents’ and in this respect the name may be compared with the name Kr2mila1 of the vis2aya which means ‘full of Kr2mis or worms’.

रेवतिकाग्राम
15. Revatika1-gra1ma (No. 21, L. 7): The village was situated in Gaya1 vis2aya.^429 Revatika1 is to be identified with Reworu in the Tikari Police area of the Gaya1 district.^430 It may have been named after a species of plant (the citron tree or cathartocarpus fistula).^431

संगोहलिकग्राम
16. Sam3gohalikagra1ma (No. 43, L. 2, L. 20): Sam3goha1lika was the name of a village. In L. 2 we get the form Sam3goha1li, while in L. 20, it is mentioned as Sam3gohalika1gra1ma.^432 Sircar takes the reading to be ‘Gulmagandhika1gra1ma’ in place of Sam3goha1likagra1ma.^433 But Sam3goha1likagra1ma is the correct form. We can compare Sam3goha1li in L. 2 of this inscription with the letters appearing in L. 20. The first  three letters are no doubt not fully legible, but the two remaining are surely ‘lika’. Thus the name can never be Gulmagandhika1, most probably it was Sam3goha1lika. Moreover, the context of both the lines 20 and 2 is the same. The word goha1li1 when joined with the suffix ‘sam3’ means ‘a good goha1li1’. In Inscription No. 28 the word goha1li1 has in all cases been spelt with long ‘i1’, i. e. goha1li1.^434

साटुवनाश्रमक
17. Sa1t2uvana1s4ramaka (No. 37, L. 16): It is the name of a village. The suffixes vana and a1s4rama are clear but the name cannot be explained due to the word ‘Sa1t2u’ the meaning of which is difficult to explain.

वटोदक
18. Vat2odaka^435 (No. 30, L. 4): It is the name of a village. Vat2a is probably a Prakritic form of vr2tta meaning ‘surrounded or covered’^436 and the word udaka means ‘water’. So the whole will literally mean ‘a place surrounded by water’. It has been mentioned in the inscription as the abode of good people where lived a person, who bore the distinguished appellation S4ri1deva.^437 Vat2odaka has been identified with Badoh which is a small village in the Bhilsa district of the old Gwalior State, now in Madhya Pradesh.^438

वायिग्राम
(19) Va1yigra1ma (No. 33, L. 9; No. 44, L. 2): It has been identified with Baigram in the Bogra (Bagura) district of Bengal, now in Pakistan.^439 In Inscription No. 44 two localities named Trivr2ta1 and S4ri1goha1li1 are mentioned as included in Vaigra1ma.^440 Va1yi is a Prakritic form of va1yu meaning air or wind and literally Va1yigra1ma means ‘a village full of air’. We also know of a town named as Va1yupura.^441 Place-names ending in Palli1

पल्ली
Palli1 The suffix -palli, palli1, pallaka or its diminutive pallika1 is derived from §pal to go, to move.^442 It means a small village, (esp.) a settlement of wild tribes (e. g. Tris4ira-palli1 = Trichinopoly).^443 Palli1 has been used as meaning a den of thieves in the Uttara1dhyanasu1tra and other Jain canonical texts,^444 the earliest portions of which are assigned to about 300 B.C.^445  The Samara1n3gan2asu1tradha1ra by king Bhojadeva, an eleventh century work, defines Palli1 thus: “Where Pulindas^446 live building their huts with leafs, branches and stones etc. is called Palli1 and a small Palli1 is called Palli1ka1”.^447 Its derivation from §pal to go, to move, fits in very well as it was an inhabitation of A1bhi1ras, thieves and barbarians who moved from one place to another and were usually in small number. It seems to be a Dravidian word loaned in Sanskrit. We find in Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada the word palli meaning hamlet, settlement, small village and in Telugu the words Palli and Palliya denoting ‘a small village’.^448 Palli1^449 is changed into: (a) bal: A1s4a1palli1, Yessabal (b) Poli, as Tris4irapalli1 (= Trishn2a1palli1), Trichinopoly (c) oli, as Ahalyapalli1, Ahiroli (also Ahia1ri). We have only one place-name ending in this suffix, with a slight variation which is ‘palla’ and is detailed below:

एरण्डपल्ल
Eran2d2apalla (No. I, L. 19): It is mentioned in the list of countries of Southern region conquered by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Damana. Fleet identifies Eran2d2apalla with Erandol in the E. Khandesh district of the Bombay Presidency.^450 K.N. Dikshit and Y.R. Gupte agreed with this view.^451 But according to Dubreuil and K.G. Sankar, it is the same as the town Erandpalli near Chicacole on the Coast of Orissa.^452 G. Ramdas opposes Fleet's identification on the ground that Eran2d2apalli1 mentioned immediately after the kingdom of Sva1midatta cannot be so far away on the western coast, it must have been in the vicinity of Kalin3ga and Pis2t2apura kingdom.^453 Eran2d2apalli1 is mentioned in the Siddhantam plates of Devendravarman of Kalin3ga.^454 Banerjee counts Damana of Eran2d2apalla among the three chiefs of Kalin3ga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their country.^455 G. Ramdas^456 regards Dubreuil's identification also to be incorrect because Chicacole lies in Kalin3ga which was clearly the country ruled by Sva1midatta. Eran2d2apalli1 will have, therefore, to be identified with the village Yendipalli in the Golgonda  Taluka of the Vizagapatam district or with the village En2d2apalli in Elore Ta1luka.^457 But if we suppese that Sva1midatta was the king of Kot2t2u1ra alone and not of the whole of Kalin3ga, Eran2d2apalli1 may well be identified with Chicacole.^458 Palla is the corrupt form of Palli1 which means an inhabitation and Eran2d2a is the castor-oil-plant^459 It seems that the region abounded in eran2d2a plants. Place-names ending in Goha1li1

गोहाली
Goha1li1 The word goha1li1 is derived from Sanskrit gos4a1la1 which is transformed into goa1l in Bengali.^460 It is generally spelt with long ‘i1’ i. e. as goha1li1,^461 but in No. 43 it has been spelt with short ‘i’.^462 This suffix has been used with the names of villages. These villages were known as goha1likas,^463 in a similar context the word prades4a is for villages which were not goha1li1s^464 These villages were probably full of cowherds. In Assam such villages are known as goa1lpa1r2a1. Following are the place-names with this suffix:

नित्वगोहाली
1. Nitva-goha1li1^465 (No. 28. L. 3, L. 9, L. 15): The maning of Nitva is inexplicable.

श्रीगोहाली
2. S4ri1goha1li1 (No. 44, L. 2, L. 8. L. 16): This locality was connected with the village Va1yigra1ma, i. e. the present Baigram.^466 The word ‘S4ri1goha1li1’ means ‘a glorious or beautiful goha1li1’. Likewise we have a place name ‘S4ri1nagara’ in Kashmir which literally means (a glorious or beautiful city).

वटगोहाली
3. Vat2a-goha1li1 (No. 28, L. 2, L. 6, L. 7, L. 12, L. 14): It was a village situated in the Pala1s4a1t2t2a Pa1rs4va within the Na1girat2t2a man2d2ala in the Daks2in2a1m3s4aka vi1thi1. It has been identified with the village of Goa1lbhi1t2a1 near Pa1ha1r2pur.^467 Vat2a is perhaps the Prakritic form of vr2tta meaning ‘surrounded, covered’.^468 The village may have been surrounded by a well or fence. On one hand we find another village named as ‘Trivr2ta1’,^469 and on the other Vat2a-nagara appears as the name of a town and Vat2odaka as the name of a river.^470 Place-names ending in Pa1rs4vika

पार्श्विक
Pa1rs4vika It means belonging to the side.^471 This suffix signifies the  geographical situation of the locality with reference to another place. There is only one name with the suffix, Pa1rs4vika in our inscriptions which is given below:

पलाशाट्टपार्श्विक
Pala1s4a1t2t2a-pa1rs4vika (No. 28, L. 2, L. 12): Pala1s4a1t2t2a may mean ‘an at2t2a^472 or turret of Pala1s4a trees’. It is possible that there were many Pala1s4a trees by the side of a hill and they may have formed a turret on the hill. The locality near such a situation may have been described as Pala1s2a1t2t2a-pa1rs4vika. Place-names ending in Pa1t2aka

पाटक
Pa1t2aka Literally meaning ‘a splittler or divider’ it means the half or any part, or a kind of village.^473 Pa1t2aka is also the name of a land measure,^474 hence earlier pa1t2aka, pa1d2aga or pa1d2a1 may have denoted a large but private house, or settlement within a village. Gradually the village and sometimes the city also came to be called after it.^475 There is only one name with this suffix in our inscriptions which is as follows:

स्वच्छन्दपाटक
Svacchandapa1t2aka (No. 37, L. 15): Svacchanda in this context may mean uncultivated or wild.^476 So it must be a kind of village with large tracts of barren land. Place-names ending in Pottaka

पोत्तक
Pottaka Pottaka^477 means the site or foundation of a house. It may signify here an inhabitation or locality. We find only one name with the suffix ‘pottaka’ in our inscriptions which is given below:

पृष्ठिमपोत्तक
Pr2s2t2hima-pottaka (No. 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 14): It seems to be a name based on the goegraphical situation of the place. Pr2s2t2hima literally meaning situated on the backside may here signify ‘a neglected place’.  Place-names ending in Viha1ra

विहार
Viha1ra Literally viha1ra means ‘a place of recreation or pleasureground’. With Buddhists or Jains it means a monastery or temple, originally a hall where the monks met or walked about. Afterwards, these halls were used as assembly halls or places of worship. The modern province of Bihar or Behar is so named on account of the large number of Buddhist monasteries in it.^478 We have only one name with the suffix ‘viha1ra’ in our inscriptions which is given below:

लोकोत्तरविहार
Lokottaraviha1ra (No. 32, L. 15): Lokottara viha1ra was possibly the proper name of some local Buddhist monastery probably named after the Lokottarava1din sect of the Hi1naya1na form of Buddhism. The Buddhist institutions alluded to in this inscription where evidently situated at or in the neighbourhood of Mandasor where the inscription was found, although no place is mentioned in the record.^479 Place-names ending in Ks2etra

क्षेत्र
Ks2etra Originally meaning an agricultural field, in which sense its use survives, ks2etra came to be used as a place-name suffix as we find in the word Kuruks2etra. As a suffix in composition it signified simply a ‘field’ for the word preceding it. For example karma-ks2etra, dharma-ks2etra, ran2a-ks2etra, siddhaks2etra, sures4vari1-ks2etra.^480 The use of this word^481 in the R2gveda points clearly to the existence of separate fields^482 carefully measured off,^483 though in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating cultivated land generally.^484 In the Atharvaveda^485 and later, the sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more general use is also found.^486 The deity Ks2etrasya Pati,^487 ‘Lord of the Field’ should probably be understood as the god presiding over each field, just as Va1stos2pati presides over each dwelling.^488  Ks2etra is changed into:^489 (a) Chatra as Ahiks2etra, Ahichatra (b) Cchatra as Ahiks2etra, Ahicchatra. In Prakrit Ks2etra changes to Khet2t2a meaning ‘a land for agriculture’, country, village and city, etc.^490 Analogous to Khet2t2a is the word ‘khed2a’ or ‘khet2a’ which means ‘a city surrounded by rivers and mountains’.^491 ‘Khet2a’ meaning ‘a small hamlet’ is also found in Pa1n2ini (VI. 2. 126).^492 The Samara1n3gan2asu1tradha1ra defines ‘Khet2a’ as the half of a city and the gra1ma as the half of a ‘Khet2a’.^493 According to Monier Williams Khet2a means a village, residence of peasants and farmers, small town (half of a Pura).^494 Lele^495 considers Khet2a or Khet2aka to be the dialectic form of the word ‘Ks2etra’. The original meaning of Khet2aka or Khet2a was an enclosure for cattle. In the course of time the pastoral camp grew into an agricultural village, and the word Khet2aka came to include agricultural village.^496 Here we collect the names of fields appearing in the inscriptions of our study. These names can be attributed to the names of individuals or gods. As the proper names are a part of the names of the fields, we treat them as place-names and do not discuss them in the context of personal-names. Some of the names sound curious and at places the readings are doubtful, the fascimile of the grant supplied by the editor being blurred. It is interesting to note that all these names occur in the same inscription, i. e. Gunaighar Grant of Vainyagupta, year 188 (No. 52). Gunaighar formerly Gun2ika1graha1ra,^497 is a village about 18 miles to the north-west of the town of Comilla, a mile and a half to the south west of the P.S. Debidvar in the district of Tippera which is modern Tripur.^498 The area is predominated by Tibeto-Burman tribes. Hence some of the names are full of tribal vocabulary.^499

बुद्धाकक्षेत्र
1. Buddha1ka-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 25): Buddha1ka seems to be a Prakritic form of Sanskrit Vr2ddha1rka meaning ‘an old or declining Sun’.^500 A field belongs to a person of this name or else the field was a place of Sunworship.

कालाकक्षेत्र
2. Ka1la1ka-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 25):  It is a Prakritic form of Sanskrit Ka1la1rka,^501 i. e. the dreadful Sun at the time of the destruction of the whole world. The field may be connected with Sun-worship. Another alternative is that it was the property of a man with this name.

खण्डविडुग्गुरिकक्षेत्र
3. Khan2d2avid2uggurika-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 26): The name is a little puzzling. Its possible Sanskrit form may be ‘khan2d2avidhugrahika-ks2etra’, i. e. a field belonging to a person who is the owner of house in the shape of half-moon.

जोलारीक्षेत्र
4. Jola1ri1-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 24): Jola1ri1 seems to be a feminine name. The word Jola1 is a Dravidian word meaning a water-course or river.^502 Jola1ri1 may have been a fisher-woman and the field belonged to her.

महिपालक्षेत्र
5. Mahipa1la-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 25): This field seems to have belonged to a person named Mahipa1la literally meaning ‘a protector of the country’, i. e. a king.

मणिभद्रक्षेत्र
6. Man2ibhadra-ks2etra (No. 52, LL. 26-27): This field belongs to Man2ibhadra literally meaning ‘the excellent jewel’. Man2ibhadra has been the name of a brother of Kubera and king of the Yaks2as (the tutelary deity of travellers and merchants).^503

मिदुविलालक्षेत्र
7. Miduvila1la-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 19): The field belonged to Miduvila1la. The word Midu is a Prakritic form of Sanskrit Mr2du^504 which means soft, delicate or beautiful. Pa1ia-Sadda-Mahan2n2avo^505 takes Vila1la, Bira1la, Bid2a1la, Bila1d2a and Bila1la as synonymous words meaning ‘a cat’. According to Bhattacharya ‘the word vila1la is evidently derived from vila with its peculiar meaning (a large watery hollow) current in Bengal.^506 D.C. Sircar takes it to be a mechanic caste like vardhaki (carpenter).^507 We find the word Vila1la occurring thrice in the Gunaighar grant (No. 52) which has been translated by the editor of the grant as follows: (a) Miduvila1la-ks2etra (L. 19): The field of Miduvila1la (b) Pakkavila1la-ks2etra (LL. 21-22): The field of Pakkavila1la (c) Gan2es4vara-Vila1la-Pus2karin2i1 (L. 28): the large marshy pond of Gan2es4vara. All the three names have been explained according to their context in this work. In (a) and (b) the editor takes vila1la as a part of the names Midu and Pakka but in (c) he translates vila1la as ‘a large  marshy (place)’. The editor should have taken either Miduvila1la and Pakkavila1la as the adjectives of the fields as in (c) or Vila1la as an adjective of Gan2es4vara and not that of Pus2karin2i1. Vila1la seems to be a part of the names Midu and Pakka which if left alone yield no meaning, but in the case of Gan2es4vara vila1la, the word vila1la seems to be an adjective of the name Gan2es4vara rather than a part of it. Here the word vila1la seems to indicate a professional caste. It is a Dravidian word.^508 The whole sense of the name ‘Miduvila1la’ is not clear.

नखद्दार्च्चरिकक्षेत्र
8. Nakhadda1rccarika-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 23): The expression means the field of Nakhadda1rccarika. The word Nakhadda1rccarika is a puzzle but it can be possibly explained as the worshipper of Naks2atras, i. e. an astronomer.^509 Naks2atra changes to nakkhatta^510 in Prakrit. Nakha and n2akkha are identical,^511 tta in nakkhatta changes to dda in sandhi here. The word ‘arccarika’ means a ‘worshipper’.^512 Stars were regarded as deities to whom regular worship (bhakti) was shown. The names based on stars were unknown in Vedic literature but became popular in the time of Pa1n2ini and later.^513

नागीजोडाकक्षेत्र
9. Na1gi1-jod2a1ka-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 24): The word Na1gi1 seems to be a feminine name of the Na1ga tribe meaning simply ‘a na1ga woman’. The word Jod2a1ka means a Yugma (two).^514 So the whole will literally mean ‘the field of two Na1gi1s’.^515

पक्कविलालक्षेत्र
10. Pakkavila1la-ks2etra (No. 52, LL. 21-22): The expression means field of Pakkavila1la. The word Pakka^516 means a barbarous tribe, a can2d2a1la. Vila1la has already been explained.^517

राजविहारक्षेत्र
11. Ra1ja-viha1ra-ks2etra (No. 52. L. 22): The field belonging to the royal viha1ra or monastery. Literally Viha1ra means “a place of recreation, pleasure-ground.” With Buddhists or Jains it means a monastery or temple, originally a hall where the monks met or walked about. Bfterwards these halls were used as temples. The province of Bihar ar Behar is also so named because of the number of Buddhist monasteries in it.^518

सूरीनाशीरम्पूर्ण्णेकक्षेत्र
12. Su1ri1na1s4i1rampu1rn2n2eka-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 19): The field of Su1ri1na1s4i1rampu1rn2n2eka or the Su1ri1na1s4i1rampu1rn2n2eka field. The name is inexplicable. 

सूर्य्यक्षेत्र
13. Su1ryya-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 25): The field of Su1ryya. The field may belong to a person named Su1ryya or it may be a place of Sun-worship.

विष्णुवर्धकिक्षेत्र
14. Vis2n2uvardhaki-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 19): The field of Vis2n2uvardhaki. Vis2n2u is the first part of the name based on god Vis2n2u. The second part of his name seems to be dropped and instead his professional epithet ‘vardhakin’ has been added which means ‘a carpenter’.^519 In Sa1n5ci1 Stu1pa Inscriptions we get the word ‘vad2akina’ which is the same as Sanskrit ‘vardhakin’ and means ‘carpenter’.^520 In the An3gavijja1,^521 we get the word ‘vat2t2aki’ which denotes a metal worker.

वैद्यक्षेत्र
15. Vaidya-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 22): The field of Vaidya, i. e. a physician.

यज्ञरातक्षेत्र
16. Yajn5ara1ta-ks2etra (No. 52, L. 27): The field of Yajn5ara1ta. Yajn5a means sacrifice or worship and ra1ta means ‘given’ presented, bestowed’.^522 The whole will literally mean ‘given by Yajn5a’. The field may be a place of worship or sacrifice. Because of the performance of Yajn5a on a certain occasion the field came to be so named as if it was a permanent place of sacrifice or the field might have been named after a person ‘Yajn5ara1ta’. Place-names ending in Pus2karin2i1

पुष्करिणी
Pus2karin2i1 Pus2kara means a blue lotus so Pus2karin2i1 denotes a lotus pool. It also means a lake or pool in general.^523 The names of some localities associated with pokhara1s or tanks have survived to modern times. Following are the place-names with this suffix:

दण्डपुष्किणी
1. Dan2d2a-Pus2kin2i1 (No. 52, L. 31): Though the reading is Dan2d2apus2kin2i1, it is to be corrected as Dan2d2a-pus2karin2i1.^524 Dan2d2a meaning punishment or rod seems to be a personal name here and the pus2karin2i1 was named after him or else it may have been in his possession.

दोषीभोगपुष्करिणी
2. Dos2i1-bhoga-pus2karin2i1 (No. 52, L. 20): Dos2i1 may stand for Sanskrit jyotis2i meaning astrologer.^525 Bhoga may be a personal name, thus the name may stand for  a pond of the astrologer named Bhoga. Another possibility is that bhoga signifies enjoyment. In that case the expression will signify a pond in the possession of an astrologer.^526

गणेश्वरवितालपुष्करिणी
3. Gan2es4vara-vita1la-pus2karin2i1 (No. 52, L. 28): Gan2es4vara was the name of the person to whom the pus2karin2i1 belonged. Vila1la is a professional epithet which denotes a mechanic caste^527 or it may have been the nick-name of the person.^528 Following are the place-names which have got no suffix with them. One-word Place-names

अवमुक्त
1. Avamukta (No. 1, L. 19): The Inscription No. 1 refers to Avamukta as one of the countries in Daks2in2a1patha subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Ni1lara1ja.^529. Avamukta has not been identified with certainty. Some scholars on the basis of the similarity of names identify it with Avimukta another name of Ka1s4i1.^530 But the suggestion cannot be accepted. Avamukta of the inscription was a country in the South while Avimukta or Ka1s4i1 is an eastern country. It may be considered to be situated in the Godavari district.^531 According to D.B. Diskalkar it must lay on the Eastern Gha1t2s which lie to the west of Ka1n5ci1 or Conjeevaram.^532

दवाक
2. Dava1ka (No. 1, L. 22): It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states subdued by Samudragupta. According to Fleet it was the ancient name of Dacca.^533 V.A. Smith takes it as corresponding to Bogra, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts.^531 But as these districts were not actually incorporated in the Gupta dominions, D.R. Bhandarkar suggests that D2ava1ka corresponds to the hill-tract of Chittagong and Tippera.^535 K. L. Barua identifieds it with Kopili valley in Assam.^536 Generally D2ava1ka is identified with modern Daboka in Nowgong district, Assam.^537 It thus corresponds to the valley of the Kapili and the Yamuna rivers in Nawgong district where we still find a place called Doboka.^538

कामरूप
3. Ka1maru1pa (No. I, L. 22): It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states which were subordi nate to Samudragupta and whose emperors paid him  taxes and all kinds of obeisance. Majumdar^539 identifies it with Upper Assam. Ka1maru1pa consisted of the Western districts of the Brahmaputra valley which being the most powerful state and being the first to be approached from the western side came to denote the whole valley.^540 The area of Ka1maru1pa was estimated by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang to have been 10,000 li i. e. 1667 miles in circuit which shows that it must have comprised the whole valley of Brahmaputra.^541 S4aktisan3gama describes^542 Ka1maru1pa as extending from Ka1les4vara to the S4vetagiri and from Tripura to the Ni1la-parvata (which is the Nila1dri or Ni1laku1t2a, the name of the Ka1ma1khya1 hill). According to the Yogini1 Tantra, the kingdom of Ka1maru1pa included the whole of the Brahmaputra valley together with Rangpur and Cochbihar.^543 The Pura1n2as mention Pra1gjyotis2a, identified with Ka1ma1khya1 or Gauhati, as the capital of Ka1maru1pa.^544 The Kamauli grant of Vaidyadeva mentions Ka1maru1pa as a Man2d2ala of the Pra1gjyotis2a-bhukti.^545 The Abhidha1na, the Vaijayanti1 and the Trika1n2d2as4es2a inform us that Pra1gjyotis2a and Ka1maru1pa were the same country.^546 In the Raghuvam3s4a,^547 the separate mention of Pra1gjyotis2a and Ka1maru1pa may seem to be a little puzzling. But we see that whereas verses 81-82 of the fourth canto refer to the king of Pra1gjyotis2a as terrified, the subsequent verses describe the presentation of elephants and the offer of respects by the king of Ka1maru1pa to Raghu. Thus all the four verses are inter-linked and, the context also proves that Pra1gjyotis2a and Ka1maru1pa were the same.^548 The Buddhist Chronicle A1rya-man5jus4ri1-mu1lakalpa describes Ka1maru1pa as a country of the east.^549 The Br2hatsam3hita1^550 and the Ka1vyami1ma1m3sa1^551 also mention it in the same direction. Chatterji remarks that the tribes living on the frontiers of Ka1maru1pa were akin to the Man tribes of South-Western China, a wild Tibeto-Chinese people.^552 The Ahoms of the Shan Tribe came into Assam at the beginning of the 13th century due to the break-up of the Chinese empire by the Moguls and ruled till the British occupation in the beginning of the 19th century.^553

काञ्ची
4. Ka1n5ci1 (No. I, L. 19): The earliest epigraphic mention of Ka1n5ci1 is to be found in this  inscription. The inscription refers to Vis2n2ugopa of Ka1n5ci1 as one of the kings of Daks2in2a1patha defeated by Samudragupta but reinstated in their kingdoms. Ka1n5ci1 is the same as Ka1n5ci1pura or modern Conjeevaram in the Chingleput district of Madras Presidency.^554 The kingdom of Ka1n5ci1 extended from the mouth of the Krishna to the south of the river Palar and sometimes even to the Kaveri.^555 It is also known as Ka1n5ci1ped2u.^556 It is mentioned in several early records relating to the ancient history of the Pallavas of Ka1n5ci1 (of about A.D. 250 to 355)^557 The Aihole inscription of Pulakes4in, the Ca1lukya ruler in the 7th century A.D. refers to his conquest of Ka1n5ci1pura.^558 The earliest literary reference to Ka1n5ci1 is in the Maha1bha1s2ya of Patan5jali.^559 The Maha1bha1s2ya on Va1rttika 26 to Pa1n2ini IV. 2. 104 mentions Ka1n5ci1puraka (i. e. a resident of Ka1n5ci1pura).^560 Hiuen Tsang informs us that Ka1n5ci1 was 30 li or 5 miles in circuit, and that in the city there were eighty Deva temples and many hereties called Nirgranthas.^561 The Pura1n2as attach great importance to Ka1n5ci1.^562 It is included in a list of seven holy cities of India.^563 The Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a^564 associates Ka1n5ci1 with Ka1s4i1, the two forming the two eyes of S4iva. It is stated in the Ba1rhaspatya su1tra^565 that Ka1n5ci1 is a S4a1kta-ks2etra. In the Devi1bha1gavata^566, Ka1n5ci1 is said to be a stha1na of the Devi1 called Annapu1rn2a1.^567 The Va1mana Pura1n2a^568 mentions it as the best among the cities. The Skandapura1n2a^569 counts it amongst the holy places. The Bha1gavatapura1n2a^570 and the Yogini1tantra^571 also mention it. In Das4akuma1racaritam^572 it is referred to as a city of the Dra1vid2a country. Ka1n5ci1 is full of temples and shrines. S4iva Ka1n5ci1 and Vis2n2u Ka1n5ci1 form the western and eastern parts of the city, while the Jaina Ka1n5ci1 is known as Tiruparutti-Kunram.^573 Of the temples at Conjeevaram, the most famous are the Ka1ma1ks2i1 temple with a Cakra placed in front of the deity, the Vaikun2t2ha Perumal temple of Vis2n2u and the S4hiva temple of Kaila1s4ana1tha.^574 Apart from its religious significance Ka1n5ci1 has been a famous centre of learning. The Pallava ruler Mahendravarman, the author of the Mattavila1sa-Prahasana; Bha1ravi, the author  of the Kira1ta1rjuni1yam and Dan2d2in, the author of the Das4akuma1racaritam are said to have flourished here.^575 The famous Buddhist dialectician Dinna1ga came here to satisfy his intellectual and spiritual thirst and about the middle of the fourth century A.D., the bra1hman2a Mayu1ras4araman, who founded the Kadamba line came here for getting recognition in Vedic learning.^576 The A1di-guru S4an3kara1ca1rya established here the famous Pi1t2ha known as Ka1makotipi1t2ha.^577 Literally Ka1n5ci1 means a ‘girdle’. It seems to have been so named because it is situated like a girdle round the sea.

काशी
5. Ka1s4i1 (No. 28, L. 6): It is mentioned in Inscription No. 28. According to the inscription a viha1ra at Vat2a-goha1li1 was inhabited by the disciples of the Nigrantha preceptor (S4raman2a1ca1rya) Guhanandin, belonging to the Pan5ca-stu1pa section (nika1ya) of Ka1s4i1.^578 Evidently Vat2agoha1li1 was a seat of Jain monks who had their major seat at Ka1s4i1. The name Ka1s4i1 is derived from the root Kas4 ‘to shine’. The Skandapura1n2a^579 says that the city of Ka1s4i1 became famous by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirva1n2a or because, that indescribable refulgence, viz. god S4iva shines forth here.^580 B.C. Law connects it with Ti-miao meaning ‘read sprouts’, a Chinese translation of the word and this links it with a certain kind of grass.^581 It has been known for centuries under five different names, viz., Va1ra1n2asi1 (modern Banaras), Ka1s4i1, Avimukta, A1nandaka1nana and S4mas4a1na or Maha1s4mas4a1na.^582 The earliest mention of the Ka1s4i1s as a tribal people occurs in the Paippala1da recension of the Atharvaveda.^583 Va1ra1n2asi1 was the capital of the people of Ka1s4i1.^584 Thus it seems that geographically Ka1s4i1 represented a larger area than Va1ra1n2asi1, the latter being the capital of the former. But in medieval times the position became just the reverse. Va1ra1n2asi1 comprehended the entire district and Ka1s4i1 generally represented only a small place. In a grant of Maha1ra1ja Vina1yakapa1la we get a reference to a village of Tikkarika1 situated in the Pratis2t2ha1na-bhukti, and attached to Ka1s4i1-pa1ra-Pathaka which belonged to Va1ra1n2asi1 vis2aya.^585 Ka1s4i1 pa1ra-pathaka represented the site of the ancient city of the Ka1s4i1.^586 The Vividhati1rthakalpa^587 also mentions  Ka1s4i1 as a janapada in the Va1ra1n2asi1 City. The ancient kingdom of Ka1s4i1 was bounded by Kos4ala on the north, Magadha on the east, and Vatsa on the west. The Cedis and Karus2as lived to their south.^588 At the time of Buddha, the kingdom of Ka1s4i1 was absorbed by the kingdom of Kos4ala.^589 We know that Lord Buddha gave his first discourse near Ka1s4i1 in the Deer Park at Sa1rna1th. Ka1s4i1 was an important Buddhist centre and was a seat of monastic establishments in the time of As4oka.^590 During the period of Gupta rule it was on its way to become a strong centre of S4iva worship with the maha1lin3gas set up in different parts of the city.^591 The Pura1n2as include the region in the Gupta empire.^592 It was a great centre of trade and commerce. Patan5jali in his Maha1bha1s2ya^593 mentions Ka1s4i1 cloth. The Buddhist literature gives us many accounts of the merchants of the city.^594 Ka1s4i1 has been a place of much improtance for Hindu pilgrimage. Its religious importance has been discussed at length in the Ka1s4i1khan2d2a of the Skanda Pura1n2a. Lord S4iva never leaves it, hence it is known as Avimukta. A man who dies here is believed to get emancipation.^595

कोसल
6. Kosala (No. 1, L. 19): It is spelt both ways with the dental as well as with the palatal sibilant. It is included in the list of the Daks2in2a1patha kingdoms whose kings were conquered but reinstated by Samudragupta. At that time Mahendra was its ruler. It has been identified with South Kosala corresponding to modern district of Raipur, Sambalpur and Bilaspur of M.P. and Orissa.^596 Its old capital was S4ri1pura (modern Sirpur), 40 miles north-east of Raipur.^597 It is the same as Maha1-kosala^598 which forms the largest unit among the three component parts of the State of Madhya Pradesh.^599 The recent excavation at Eran2 has thrown a flood of new light on the early history of eastern Malwa and Maha1kosala between the period 1900 B.C. and A.D. 600. During the Gupta period several Brahmanical temples were built in this region. In the early medieval period i. e. from A.D. 600 to 1200, the Candellas and Kalacuris were the two chief ruling dynasties in the Maha1kosala area. In the period of Muslim rule followed by Maratha supremacy, many forts and fortresses were built  by the ruling chiefs^600 in different parts of Maha1kosala. Daks2in2a Kosala is mentioned in the Ratna1vali1 (Act IV) as having been conquered by Udayana, king of Vatsa.^601 N.L. Dey^602 identifies Daks2in2a Kosala with Tosali1 of As4oka's inscription (Tosala) at Dhauli, which is situated near Bhuvanes4war in the Puri district, Orissa. Sylvain Levi suggests an Austric origin for this wold. ‘Kosala changing to Tosala is an apparent variation of the initial due to the formative prefix’^603 in the Austric languages. The country of Tosala also, like Kosala, had two divisions: Uttara Tosala and Daks2in2a Tosala.^604 Daks2in2a Tosala consisted of a man2d2ala of the name of Kon3goda. In some cases by mistake the reading Daks2in2a kosala is given in place of Daks2in2a Tosala.^605 But it is clear from other evidence that Tosala and Kosala were two separate entities. The pura1n2as mention them separately.^606 The Ka1vyami1ma1m3s2a1 also makes a separate reference to the two.^607

कोट्टूर
7. Kot2t2u1ra (No. 1, L. 19): It is mentioned as one of the Southern kingdoms conquered by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Sva1midatta. It has been identified by N. Dubreuil with Kothoor in Ganjam.^608 Banerjee counts Sva1midatta of Kot2t2u1ra among the three chiefs of Kalin3ga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their country.^609 According to Fleet Kot2t2u1r (from Kot2t2apura) being a very common Dravidian name, may be looked for in any Kot2t2u1ra of note, in a mountainous part of Southern India, e. g. possibly Kot2t2u1r in the Coimbatore district, at the foot of one of the passes in the Anaimalai Hills.^610 R. Sathianathaier proposes to identify Kot2t2u1ra with Kot2t2u1ra near Tuni (E. Godavari district) and maintains that Samudragupta did not pass through Orissa, Ganjam and Vizagapatam^611 There is another Kot2t2u1ra in the Vizagapatam district.^612 But the generally accepted view is to indentify it with Kothoor in Ganjam.

कुराल
8. Kura1la (No. I, L. 19): It has been mentioned as one of the kingdoms of Daks2in2a1patha subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Man2t2ara1ja. Fleet suggests that Kaura1laka is a mistake for Kairalaka, denoting the well known province Kerala in the South of India.^613 D.R. Bhandarkar^614 identifies this Kerala with the Sonpur  territory in C.P. round about Yaya1tinagara where the author of the Pavanadu1ta locates the Keralas. Barnett identified it with modern village Kora1d2a in South India.^615 Kura1l2a is taken by Kielhorn^616 to be the same as Kuna1la mentioned in the Aihole inscription of Pulakes4in II^617 and identified with the Kolleru lake between the Godavari and the Krishna.^618 But D.R. Bhandarkar^619 objects to this view on the ground that the Kolleru lake must have been included in the kingdom of Ven3gi1 mentioned later on^620 in the same list in the inscription. G. Ramdas^621 seems to be right when he observes that Kura1l2a must be the plain country of the Ganjam district to the north-east of the Mahendra hill now chiefly occupied by the Oriyas.

नेपाल
9. Nepa1la (No. I, L. 22): It is mentioned as one of the border states which accepted the subordination of Samudragupta. Some take it to refer to Tippera^622 which is doubtful.^623 The city is said to have been founded by Ne r2s2i who performed his religious services at the junction of the Ba1gmati1 and Kesa1vati1 and who also ruled over the country.^624 The Nepa1la valley originally contained a lake called Na1ga Ba1sa or Ka1lihrada, in which lived Na1ga Karkot2aka. It was fourteen miles in length and four miles in breadth^625 The former name of Nepa1la was S4les2ma1takavana.^626 The famous temple of Pas4upatina1tha on the western bank of the Ba1gmati1 river, is situated about three miles north west of Kathmandu in the town of Devipatan said to have been founded by As4oka's daughter Ca1rumati1.^627 The S4aktisan3gama Tantra describes the country of Nepa1la as placed between Jat2es4vara and Yogini1.^628 Sircar equates Yogini1pura with Delhi and Jat2es4vara with Jalpes4vara, the famous S4iva of the Jalpaiguri district in North Bengal.^629 Nepa1la was a buffer state in the 7th century A.D. In the 8th century A.D. she shook of its domination by Tibet.^630 According to the Deopara inscription, Na1nyadeva, the ruler of Nepa1la, is said to have been defeated and imprisoned with many other princes by Vijayasena, about the middle of the 12th century A.D.^631

पलक्क
10. Palakka (No. I, L. 20): It has been mentioned as one of the kingdoms of Southern  India whose kings were first conquered and then released by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Ugrasena. Palakka has been identified with Palakkad2a, the capital of a Pallava viceroyalty and was situated in the Nellore district.^632 Law is inclined to identify Palakkad2a with Palakalu1ru in the Guntur taluka.^633 Allan and G. Ramdas locate it in the Nellore district.^634 Smith places Palakka in the Nellore district.^635 Dubreuil, however, identifies Palakka with a capital of the same name which was situated to the South of the Krishna and which is mentioned in many Pallava Copper Plates.^636 The kingdom of Palakka might have extended westwards beyond the region now occupied by the districts of Auddepal and North Arcot.^637 It was perhaps situated to the west of Ka1n5ci1 on the Eastern Gha1t2s.^638

प्रत्यन्त
11. Pratyanta (No. 1, L. 22): It is mentioned in Inscription No. 1 that the kings of frontier (or border) states ‘Samatat2a, D2ava1ka, Ka1maru1pa, Nepa1la and Kartr2pura’ gratified the imperious commands of Samudrgupta, by giving all (kinds of) taxes and obeying (his) orders and coming to perform obeisance.^639 We also find a reference to Pratyanta in the Girnar Rock Edict No. 2. of As4oka.^640 Law^641 contrasts between A1rya1varta and Pratyanta. He takes Pratyanta to mean the Mleccha country and quotes the Amarakos4a, Divya1vada1na, Abhidha1nacinta1man2i and Smr2ticandrika1.^642 But in the inscription^643 the contrast is between Daks2ina1patha and A1rya1varta while the word A1t2avikara1ja breaks the link between A1rya1varta and Pratyanta. Moreover, all the border states mentioned in the inscription could not have been Mleccha and inhabited by Kira1tas.^644 The word Pratyanta and its substitutes in the As4okan edicts also refer to the frontier states.

समतट
12. Samatat2a (No. 1, L. 22): It is one of the frontier kingdoms which offered their submission to Samudragupta.^645 Sen^646 remarks that Samudragupta reduced the king of Samatat2a to the rank of a subordinate prince who had to part with most of his powers and was ‘allowed to rule over a much reduced dominion as a vassal of the emperor’. Retaining only the control of its internal administration, he had to pay various kinds of taxes to Samudragupta, attend his durbars, render obeisance to him and gratify  his imperious commands.^647 Samatat2a is the only territory in Bengal to be referred to in the Allahabed Pras4asti.^648 The first epigraphic reference to Samatat2a is to be found in this inscription.^649 Literally the name means ‘the shore country’ or ‘Level country’.^650 ‘Samatat2a in the Gupta period denoted a territory lying to the east of the Brahmaputra’. The Br2hatsam3hita1 mentions it as a country situated in the East.^651 The Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang proceeded from Ka1maru1pa southwards and after a journey of 1,200 or 1,300 li (6 li1 mile) reached the country of Samatat2a. According to him, this country was on the seaside and was low and moist and was more than 3,000 li in circuit.^652 From Samatat2a, the pilgrim journeyed towards the West for over 900 li and reached Tanmolihti,^653 or Ta1mralipta, the modern Tamluk in the Midna1pur district.^654 Samatat2a, therefore, must have been the South-eastern part of the Bengal presidency corresponding to the Dacca, Faridpur, Backerganj, Jessore and Khulna districts.^655 It is known from the Baghaura Inscription^656 that the Tipperah district was in Samatat2a. The A1rya-Man5jus4ri1 Mu1lakalpa states that Samatat2a was situated to the east of the Lohitya.^657 The Ya1davapraka1s4a equates Bhaurika with Samatat2a.^658 Epigraphical evidence, however, shows that Samatat2a comprised the districts of Comilla, Noakhali and Sylhat.^659 Its capital Karmmanta has been identified with Bad2-Ka1mata1, 12 miles west of Comilla district.^660 After the rule of the Guptas, Samatat2a was successively under the Khad2ga, Candra, Varman and Sena dynasties.^661

वेङ्गी
13. Ven3gi1 (No. 1, L. 20): Inscription No. 1 mentions it with its king Hastivarmman who was subjugated by Samudragupta. It seems to be an abbreviated form of Ven3gi1pura by dropping the suffix Pura.^662 It is identified with Vegi1 or Ped2d2a-vegi1, a village near Ellore Taluka between the Krishna and the Godavari rivers.^663 Banerjee describes it as one of the Pallava kingdoms of South.^664 But the capital of the Pallavas was Ka1n5ci1. Ven3gi1 was the capital of the Ca1lukyan kings^665 and was also known as Vengai-na1d2u.^666  NAMES OF LOCALITIES

अवडर
1. Avad2ara (No. 46, L. 10): Kaivartti-s4res2t2hin is mentioned as the resident of Avad2ara.^667 Avad2ara is the only geographical name mentioned in the inscription. It appears to have been a locality near modern Supia, in Old Rewah State, from where the inscription has been found. The name is difficult to explain.

हिमवच्छिखर
2. Himavacchikhara (No. 36, L. 5, L. 10): Literally meaning ‘the peak of the Himalayas’ it has been identified with Bara1hachatra (Vara1haks2etra) in Nepal,^668 which is the same as the Koka1mukha ti1rtha mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata and the Pura1n2as.^669 The original temples of the gods Koka1mukha and S4vetavara1ha referred to in the record^670 along with Himavac-Chikhara, were situated at this place.^671

नष्टी
3. Nas2t2i1 (No. 5, LL. 4-5): The second part of the word is not legible. It seems to have been the name of a town in the Sukuli des4a. The meaning of the word is not clear. It must have been a place near Sa1n5ci1 in the Madhya Pradesh.

पञ्चकुल्यवापक
4. Pan5cakulyava1paka (No. 37, L. 16): The Da1modarpur Copper Plate Inscription of the time of Bha1nugupta (No. 37) records that one kulyava1pa of land was purchased to the north of Pan5cakulyava1paka. Literally it means ‘a plot of land five kulyava1pas in area: It seems to refer to a village or locality comprising five kulyava1pas of land.^672 A kulyava1pa is ‘an area of land requiring one kulya measure of seed grains to be sown’.^673 This land measure differed in different ages and localities. Maity^674 gives this area of five kulyava1pas in terms of modern measurements as follows: 5 kulyava1pas = 1 pa1t2aka = 192-240 bigha1s = 72-88 acres and believes the lower figures to be more correct.

परस्पतिका
5. Paraspatika1 (No. 37, L. 16): It seems to be the name of a locality. The metathesis of two letters ‘s’ and ‘p’ seems to have worked here. Its correct Sanskrit form should have been ‘Parapastika1’. The word ‘prapasti’ means a house, habitation or abode.^675

त्रिवृता
6. Trivr2ta1 (No. 44, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15): In L. 2, two localities named Trivr2ta1 and S4ri1goha1li1 have been  mentioned as connected with the village named Va1yigra1ma.^676 Literally it means ‘surrounded or covered by three sides’. It seems that when the locality was founded the city was surrounded by some natural boundary on its three sides. This may have been in the form of rivulets or streams or hillocks. TRIBAL PLACE-NAMES Following are the place-names which have tribal associations without any mention of the specific boundary:

आर्यावर्त्त
1. A1rya1vartta (No. 1, L. 12): Samudragupta is stated to have violently exterminated many kings of A1rya1varta such as Rudradeva, Matila, Na1gadatta, Candravarman, Gan2apatina1ga, Na1gasena, Acyuta, Nandin and Balavarman.^677 We also find references to A1rya1varta in other epigraphic records.^678 Literally A1rya1varta^679 means ‘the abode of the A1ryas, or excellent or noble people’. The word ‘A1rya’ here is significant. It has been interpreted in two ways: some scholars derive the word A1rya from the root §Ar, to plough, and suggest that the Vedic A1ryans were so called because they despised the pursuits of agriculture and remained shepherds and hunters.^680 “If A1rya were purely a racial term. a more probable derivation would be Ar, meaning strength or valour, from §ar to fight, whence we have the name of the Greek war-god Ares, areios, brave or warlike, perhaps even arete, virtue signifying, like the Latin virtues, first physical strength and courage and then moral force and elevation”.^681 “Intrinsically, in its most fundamental sense, A1rya means an effort or an uprising or overcoming. The A1ryan is he who strives and overcomes all outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human advance.”^682 Wilson says that a variety of ancient designations of which ‘A1ria’ is a component element (cf. Aria1na) are connected with the term A1rya. The Zend name for the country to the west of the Indus was ‘Eriene-veejo’, that is the Sanskrit A1rya1varta.^683 In defining the boundaries of A1rya1varta, Vasis2t2ha and Baudha1yana in their Dharmasu1tras lay stress on the word A1rya and explain it to mean s4is2t2a. Patan5jali also in his Maha1 bha1s2ya first explains the meaning of s4is2t2a in order to draw attention to the cultural basis of the name A1rya1varta. He remarks that correct conduct is found in A1rya1varta and then mentions its boundaries.^684 In the Bra1hman2a period the centre of A1ryan culture and civilization shifted to the Gangetic Doab “A1rya1varta came to be treated as conterminous with the region between the Gan3ga1 and Yamuna1.^685 In the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka^686 special honour is assigned to those who dwell between the Gan3ga1 and the Yamuna1. In the S4utra period A1rya1varta extended from the hills of Central Rajasthan to the hills of Central Bihar.^687 At the time of Patan5jali,^688 A1rya1varta was bounded on the north by the Himalayas, on the south by Pa1riya1traka, on the west by A1dars4a1vali1 and on the east by Ka1lakavana (Rajmahal hills) ‘Black Forest’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardwar.^689 Thus it seems that A1rya1varta bore a sacerdotal sense and denoted a particularly limited area where A1ryan institutions were the basis of social order.^690 What was originally called A1rya1varta was later named as Madhya-des4a and A1rya1varta came to include the whole of Northern India. This is related to the gradual spread of A1ryanism.^691 Brahma1varta and Brahmars2ides4a lost their identity in the Madhya-des4a and combined with Pra1cya, Prati1cya and Udi1cya (Uttara1patha) became the equivalent of A1rya1varta.^692 Both Udi1cya and Pra1cya were taken as the home (loka) of standard Sanskrit both in Pa1n2ini's time and earlier. In the time of Patan5jali, A1rya1varta came to be regarded as the home of the S4is2t2as (persons proficient in the S4a1stras) whose language set the norm.^693 By the second century A.D., the last limit of the composition of the Manu-smr2ti, the wider outlook of A1rya1varta was popular. It was the name of the tract extending from the Eastern to the Western Ocean, and bounded on the north and south by the Himalaya and Vindhya respectively.^694 This is supported by the Ka1vyami1ma1m3sa1 of Ra1jas4ekhara.^695 Ra1jas4ekhara speaks of the river Narmada1 as the dividing line between A1rya1varta and the Daks2in2a1patha.^696 In Inscription No. 1, L. 29 A1rya1varta is contrasted with Daks2in2a1patha, ‘the southern region’.^697 The wider sense of A1rya1varta is also supported by  references in the Abhidha1na-cinta1man2i^698 and the Ra1jataran3gin2i1.^699

काकनादबोट
2. Ka1kana1dabot2a (No. 5, L. 1; No. 23, L. 2): In both the inscriptions, we find reference to a grant to the A1rya Sam3gha or the Community of the faithful, at the great Viha1ra, or Buddhist convent of Ka1kana1dabot2a,^700 for the purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps. D.C. Sircar takes ‘Ka1kana1dabot2a’ to be the old name of Sa1n5ci1.^701 Fleet is of the view that the Ka1kana1dabot2a convent is the Great Stu1pa itself. According to him the word Bot2a is another form of Pot2a which means ‘the foundation of a house’.^702 Fleet further writes that the name ‘Ka1kana1da’ lit. ‘the noise of the crow’ was the ancient name of Sa1n5ci1 itself which is proved by its occurrence in two inscriptions in Mauryan characters found at Sa1n5ci1.^703 Thus, it is clear that Ka1kana1da was the ancient name of Sa1n5ci1 in the Bhopal State, now Raisen district, Madhya Pradesh, well-known for its Buddhist topes.^704 The word ‘bot2a’ is thus a surplus and joined by ‘Ka1kana1da’ will refer to the great stu1pa itself. Its form Pot2a meaning the foundation of a house is untenable because the word ‘viha1ra’ in that very sense appears in the inscriptions. The word ‘bot2a’ has been used here in the sense of an ascetic cult.^705 It is a Prakrit word which has been used here to refer to ‘the Buddhist cult’. Thus the relevant expression means ‘in the holy great viha1ra of the Buddhist cult (assembly) at Ka1kana1da’. Fleet is wrong in translating the word Ka1kana1da to mean ‘the noise of the crow’.^706 K.P. Jayaswal's rendering ‘the praise of the Ka1kas’^707 is more to the point. We know of the Ka1kas, an autonomous community mentioned in the Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.^708 In Eastern Malwa we have two ancient place-names connected with the Ka1kas. One is the hill now called Sa1n5ci1 hill (the ancient) Ka1kana1da. The other is an ancient village called Ka1ka-pura, some 20 miles north of Bhilsa, and full of ancient monuments.^709

उत्तरकुरु
3. Uttara Kuru (No. 22, L. 7): A person named S4am3kara is described in the inscription as born in the region of the north, the best of countries, which resembles (in beautitude) the land of the Northern Kurus.^710  The Kurus had two branches, the northern and the southern. Uttarakuru or the country of the Northern Kurus, is supposed to be a region beyond the most northern range of the Hima1laya mountains, and is described as a country of everlasing happiness.^711 We have discussed in details, the Kurus, in the section on tribes. The Br2hatsam3hita1^712 mentions it as a country situated in the North. In the later period the Uttarakurus had only a mythical or legendary existence.

वङ्ग
4. Van3ga (No. 20, L. I): In this inscription, king Candra, “on whose arm fame was inscribed by the sword, when in battle in Van3ga countries, is stated to have kneaded, back with his breast the enemies who, uniting together, came against him”.^713 This is taken by scholars^714 to be the first epigraphic mention of Van3ga. The Van3gas here mean the ‘Van3ga country’ the eastern Bengal of modern times. Bajpai is of the opinion that the Van3gas of the Meharauli1 Pillar Inscription of Candra (No. 20) are the people living in the Makaran coast of Baluchistan.^715 But the Van3gas here denote country and not the people. Moreover, the victory of king Candra over the Van3ga countries has no connection with his conquest of the Va1hlikas. Both are separately mentioned in his campaign. In Sanskrit the tribal name in the plural is regularly used to indicate the country inhabited by the tribe.^716 The Van3ga countries are also referred to in the Maha1ku1t2a Pillar Inscription,^717 but in the inscriptions after the 9th century A.D. the word Van3ga1la is usually mentioned.^718 The earliest mention of the Van3gas along with the Magadhas is in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka.^719 The name is also found in the Baudha1yana Dharma-Su1tra^720 where the Van3gas are mentioned as impure people.^721 But the Drama ‘Pratijn5a1-Yaugandhara1yan2a’ (Act II), ascribed to Bha1sa and probably not older than the 4th century A.D., suggests that the ruling families of Bengal were regarded as equals to those of Northern India for intermarriage with the royal family of Ma1lava.^722 The people of Van3ga are stated to have fought in the Kurukshetra war^723 and, in course of his expedition Bhi1s2ma is said to have defeated Samudrasena of Van3ga.^724 The Ka1s4ika1 mentions Va1n3gaka to explain Pa1n2ini's su1tra (IV. 3. 100) denoting  loyalty of the citizen to the state.^725 Pa1n2ini mentions Va1n3gi1 (the lady of Van3ga Janapada) along with Avanti1, Kuru1 and Yaudheyi1.^726 Patan5jali also refers to the Van3gas by way of illustration.^727 Kaut2ilya makes similar references to the country.^728 The Bha1gavata Pura1n2a also mentions it as a country.^729 Ka1lida1sa states that Raghu after conquering the Sumhas,^730 defeated the Van3gas with his force.^731 The Ka1vyami1ma1m3sa1 mentions Van3ga as a janapada situated in the east.^732 The Br2hatsam3hita1 also mentions it in the east along with UpaVan3ga.^733 According to the Maha1bha1rata^734 Van3ga, son of Bali, had establishad this country. The Amarakos4a^735 mentions Van3ga as a synonym of Ran3ga (lead), but lead is not available in Bengal and is found in abundance in Malaya, Pegu and East Indies. People in other parts of India may have received lead through the people of East Bengal. Sus4ruta also uses Van3ga in the same sense as Amara does^736 R.C. Banerji^737, on the basis of the Ablur Inscription of the Kalacuri king Bijjala^738 takes Van3ga and Van3ga1la as two distinct people or tribes. This view has been correctly refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri^739 who concludes that Van3ga1la was within Van3ga and hence was not altogether a separate geographical entity as is maintained by some. The confusion may be due to the fact that the geographical location of the Van3ga country changed in different periods. The same country Van3ga was known as Van3ga1la with the addition of the Prakrit suffix ‘a1la’^740 which was transliterated by the Muslims as Banga1lah (pronouncing Banga1la) in their script^741 and this was changed into Bengal by the English people. The Ya1davapraka1s4a equates Van3ga with Harikeli^742 but the Kalpadrukos4a, a work of the seventeenth century states that S4ri1hat2t2a is Harikeli.^743 The commentary of Yas4odhara on the Ka1masu1tra refers to Van3ga as situated to the east of the Brahmaputra.^744

गङ्गा
1. Gan3ga1 (No. 1, L. 31, No. 13, L. 16): In Inscription No. 1 Samudragupta's fame has been compared with the pale yellow water of the river Gan3ga1, which travelling by many paths, purifies the three worlds, flowing quickly on being liberated from confinement in the thickets of the matted hair of (the) god Pas4upati.^1 In the Mandasor inscription of Yas4odharman and Vis2n2uvardhana^2 it is stated that when the river Gan3ga1 was about to descend from heaven to earth, in order to break the force of its fall, god S4iva (Pas4upati) received it in the matted hair coiled above his forehead and projecting like a horn; its waters wandered there for a thousand years, before they eventually reached the earth. In Inscription No. 13, we get a reference to Gan3ga1 in the context of Skandagupta's fight with the Hu1n2as, the noise of which was heard like the roaring of (the river) Gan3ga1, making itself noticed in their ears.^3 A.C. Woolner^4 remarked that the name Gan3ga1 does not seem to have a convincing derivation on the A1ryan side. But we do find the word in the Un2a1di affixes. The affix Gan comes after the root Gam3 ‘to go’ and the word Gan3ga1 is formed.^5 The earliest mention of Gan3ga1 is in the R2gveda.^6 The name also occurs in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a^7 and the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka.^8 We find it also in Patan5jali's Maha1bha1s2ya,^9 and in Ka1lida1sa's Raghuvam3s4a.^10 It is mentioned many times in the Pura1n2as^11 in which a good deal of religious importance is attached to it.^12 The Gan3ga1 emerges first in the Gangotri in the district of  Garhwal and proceeds in different courses from Hardwar to Bulandshahar and from Allahabad to Rajmahal from where it enters Bengal.^13

हचातगङ्ग
2. Haca1ta Gan3ga (No. 52, L. 31): We find the mention of Haca1ta Gan3ga in inscription No. 52, but it is difficult to identify it. It may, however, be remarked here that the word Gan3ga is to be taken in the sense of a river.^14

जम्बूनदी
3. Jambu1nadi1 (No. 37, L. 17): Sen considers it to be the name of a river.^15 It has been described as the name of one of the seven arms of the heavenly Gan3ga1.^16 We also know of a Jambu1nadi1 as a vi1thi1 in the Gaya1 Vis2aya mentioned in the Na1landa1 plate of Dharmapa1ladeva.^17

कालिन्दी
4. Ka1lindi1 (No. 18 L. 3): According to the inscription in the reign of Budhagupta, his feudatory, Maha1ra1ja Suras4micandra was governing the country lying between the river Ka1lindi1 and Narmada1.^18 Ka1lindi1 is the same as the river Yamuna1.^19 The Yamuna1 has got its source from the Kalindades4a, a mountainous country situated in the Ba1ndarapuccha range or the Hima1laya and hence the river is called Ka1lindi1.^20 In the Pura1n2as we get the earlier mention of Ka1lindi1 by both the names, Ka1lindi1 as well as Yamuna1.^21 The Ka1lindi1 is also mentioned in the S4is4upa1lavadha of Ma1ga.^22

नर्मदा
5. Narmada1 (No. 18, L. 3): The above-mentioned inscription describes reign of Maha1ra1ja Suras4micandra, a feudatory of Budhagupta, as governing over the area between the rivers Ka1lindi1 and Narmada1.^23 This is one of the earliest inscriptional references to the river Narmada1.^24 It is mentioned as Narmados by Ptolemy.^25 No express reference to the Narmada1 can be traced in the Vedic literature. But the knowledge of the river is implied in the reference to a chief Revottaras mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a.^26 We find from the Amarakos4a^27 that Reva1 is another name of the river Narmada1. It is likely that the name of the chief was derived from his association with the river.^28 The Raghuvam3s4a speaks of Mahis2mati1 as the capital of Anu1pa on the bank of the Reva1 (i. e. Narmada1).^29 It has been mentioned several times in the Maha1bha1rata and the  Pura1n2as.^30 The Vis2n2upura1n2a says that by chanting a mantra addressed to the Narmada1, one does not have any fear from serpents.^31 The river rises in the Amarakan2t2aka mountain and falls into the Gulf of Cambay. The junction of the Narmada1 with the sea is a sacred place of pilgrimage.^32 According to the Pura1n2as it flows from a R2ks2vat (a part of the Vindhyan range) though some of them refer to it arising directly from the Vindhya itself.^33 It is stated in the Ku1rma and Matsya Pura1n2as that a man who commits suicide at any ti1rtha on the Narmada1 or on the Amarakan2t2aka does not return to this world.^34 Several rivers such as Kapila1, Vis4alya1, Eran2d2i1, Iks2unadi1 and Ka1veri1^35 are mentioned as falling into the Narmada1.

पद्मा
6. Padma1 (No. 16, L. 5): The inscription No. 16 refers to a bra1hman2a named Devavis2n2u, who belonged to the community of Caturvedins of Padma1 of the town of Indrapura.^36 The Gan3ga1 is also known as Padma1 or Padda1.^37 The community of the bra1hman2as mentioned in the inscription might have lived by the side of the river. D.C. Sircar takes Padma1 to be the name of a locality in the town of Indrapura.^38 The inscription (No. 16) also tells us that Skandagupta's feudatory vis2ayapati S4arvana1ga was governing Antarvedi or the country lying between the Gan3ga1 and the Yamuna1.^39

पलाशिनी
7. Pala1s4ini1^40 (No. 14, L. 16): This river Pala1s4ini1 issues from the mountain Raivataka. On account of the flood it had swollen. The poet, in describing the scene says that the river had gone to join the sea. Pala1s4ini1 is described as emanating from the mountain U1rjayat (i. e. the same as Raivataka).^41 We find another Pala1s4ini1, (mod. Para1s), a tributary of the Koel in Chot2a1nagpur.^42 It seems that the river was decorated with numerous Pala1s4a (flower) trees that grew on its banks. The flowers falling in the river must have given it the name of Pala1s4ini1.^43

सिकता
8. Sikata1^44 (No. 14, L. 16): The river Sikata1 takes its source from the mountain Raivataka. It is the same as Suvarn2a-sikata1 mentioned in the Juna1gar2h Rock Inscription of Rudrada1man.^45 This Sikata1 or Suvarn2asikata1 is to be identified with modern Son2arekha1.^46 The name  Suvan2n2areha1 (Suvarn2arekha1) is also met with in Vividhati1rthakalpa.^47 Thus the first part of the river's name has remained unchanged for about two thousand years. The second part has been replaced by a new one. The exact derivative as suggested by Chatterji will be a form like Sonasi1ta1 or Sonasi1.^48 The river was named Suvarn2asikata1 because its sand contains particles of gold.^49

सिन्धु
9. Sindhu (No. 20, L. 2): The river is mentioned in connexion with the description of the victories of king Candra who is said to have conquered the Va1hlikas after having crossed the seven mouths of the (river) Sindhu^50 in warfare. Sindhu in the R2gveda^51 and the Atharvaveda^52 often means simply a ‘stream’. The R2gveda (VIII. 24. 27) refers to ‘Sapta Sindhavah2’ or ‘the seven rivers’.^53 But it is also^54 used in the more exact sense of the ‘stream’ par excellence or ‘The Indus’. We get a reference to Sindhu as a river in the Amara-kos4a.^55 The territories adjoining it were famous for horses^56 and salt.^57 The term Sindhu was corrupted to Hindu in the old Persian inscriptions of Darius I (516-485 B.C.), and to Indus by the Ionian (= Pa1n2ini's Yavana) Greeks.^58 The word ‘India’ is derived from the river Sindhu or the Indus.^59 Taking its rise from the snows of Western Kaila1s4a in Tibet, the Sindhu first flows north-west of Kashmir and South of little Pamir, and then takes a southward course along which lay some of the important cities of north India. Emerging from the Darad high-lands, the river (Da1radi1 Sindhuh2) enters the Gandha1ra country until it receives its most important western tributary the Kabul river at Ohind, a few miles north of Attock.^60 The river Sindhu is mentioned in the Pura1n2as along with the Gan3ga1, Sarasvati1, Satluj, Chinab and Yamuna1.^61 Vogel suggests that the expression ‘Sindhor sapta mukha1ni’ may indicate the ‘sapta sindhavah2’ of the R2gveda, i. e. the river Indus and its tributaries. The term mukha would then be not taken in the sense of ‘the mouth of a river’, but as meaning a river-head.^62 But the translation of the expression as done by Fleet (i. e. the seven mouths of the river Indus) is generally accepted.^63 The seven mouths of the river Indus thus represent the points of its confluence with its tributaries  and not the tributaries individually as suggested by Vogel.

सुदर्शन
10. Sudars4ana (No. 14, L. 15: L. 17): It is the name of a lake situated at some distance from Girinagara as mentioned in the Juna1gar2h Rock Inscription of Rudrada1man I (A.D. 150).^64 The lake was originally constructed by the Vais4ya Pus2yagupta, the provincial governor of the Maurya king Candragupta. Later on during the reign of As4oka it was adorned with conduits, by the Yavana governor Tus2a1spha.^65 The same lake was destroyed by the excessive floods in the Suvarn2asikata1, Pala1s4ini1 and other streams arising from the mountain U1rjayat.^66 By a breach, four hundred and twenty cubits long, just as much broad, (and) seventy-five cubits deep, all the water flowed out, so that, the lake, almost like a sandy desert became extremely ugly to look at.^67 The lake was immediately beatufied with repairs by king Rudrada1man.^68 Inscription No. 14 informs us that during the reign of Gupta king Skandagupta in the year 136 (G. E.), due to heavy continous rains the Sudars4ana lake burst out on all sides^69 and had the appearance of a sea. Eventually, contrary to the literal meaning of its name the Sudars4ana became ugly to look at.^70 The lake was reparied in the year 137 (G. E.)^71 (= A.D. 456) by Cakrapa1lita, who was appointed governor of Girinagara by his father Parn2adatta, who was Skandagupta's viceroy in Sura1s2t2ra.^72

वाटानदी
11. Va1t2a1-nadi1 (No. 43, L. 22): We get a reference to the Va1t2a1-nadi1 in an inscription at Kalaikuri, Sulta1npur near Naogaon, Rajshahi district, East Pakistan now Bangla Desh. It was flowing to the east of a village named Dha1nyapa1t2alika1. ‘The Va1t2a1 nadi1 appears to be the modern Ba1ra1-nai, Singra lying about 10 miles to the north-east of its junction with the Atrai.^73 It flows west to east through the southern part of the Rajshahi district^74

विलासिनी
12. Vila1sini1^75 (No. 14, L. 16): The river comes out from the mountain Raivataka. Fleet takes Sikata1vila1sini1 as an adjective of the Pala1s4ini1^76 but the three, Sikata1, Vila1sini1 and Pala1s4ini1 seem to be separate rivers as we find the use of the plural number in the case which  denotes the mention of more than two rivers. Hence Vila1sini1 is the third river in the context: the other two being Pila1s4ini1 and Sikata1 (Suvarn2asikata1). THE MOUNTAINS

कैलाश
1. Kaila1s4a (No. 17, L. 6: L. 13): In L. 6 of the inscription the poet while giving an account of the city of Das4apura describes its buildings as lofty like the mountain Kaila1s4a itself.^77 L. 13 describes the mountain Ka1ilas4a as one of the breasts of the earth (the other being Sumeru) which was being reigned over by the Gupta king Kuma1ragupta.^78 Kaila1s4a mountain is situated about 25 miles to the north of Ma1na-sarovara beyond Gangri1 and to the east of the Niti Pass.^79 The Maha1bha1rata^80 includes the Kumaun and Garhwal mountains in the Kaila1s4a range. The mountain also known as Hemaku1t2a, S4am3karagiri and is to be identified with the As2t2apada mountain of the Jainas.^81 It surpasses in beauty the big Gurla1 or any other of the Indian Hima1laya.^82 Traditionally it is supposed to be the habitat of S4iva and Pa1rvati1.^83

रैवतक
2. Raivataka (No. 14, L. 16) (the same as U1rajayat see U1rjayat): Raivataka is also mentioned in the A1di-Parvan of the Maha1bha1rata,^84 the Vividhati1rthakalpa,^85 the Br2hatsam3hita1,^86 the Dohad Stone Inscription of Mahamu1da,^87 and the Jaunpur Inscription of Is4a1navarman.^88 Its modern name Girnar was a switch over to it from the city name Girinagara, i. e., ‘a city on or at the foot of a hill’.^89 Raivataka derives its name from king Revata1, the father of Revati1, (the wife of Baladeva, Kr2s2n2a's elder brother).^90 Revata is supposed to have come there from Dwa1raka1 and lived on the hill. There is still a tank called Revati1-kun2d2a near Da1modarakun2d2a in the gorge of the hill.^91 The Gujarati Sanskrit poet Ma1gha in the S4is4upa1lavadha devotes the whole of Canto IV (verses 1-68) to the description of the Raivataka mountain. In Canto VI (verses 1-79) the poet describes the occurrence of six seasons one by one at the mountain Raivataka.

सुमेरु
3. Sumeru (No. 17, L. 13, No. 32, L. 15): In No. 17 the mountain Sumeru is described as one of the breasts of the earth (the other being Kaila1s4a) and the Gupta  king Kuma1ragupta is mentioned as the lord of the earth. In No. 32 it has been named as Amarabhu1dhara. Its other names are Meru, Karn2ika1cala, Ratnasa1nu, Svargiri, Svargigiri and Ka1n5canagiri.^92 Sumeru is identified with Rudra Hima1laya in Garhwal, where the river Gan3ga1 has its source, it is near Badarika1s4rama.^93 According to the Matsya Pura1n2a^94 the Sumeru Parvata is bounded on the north by Uttara-Kuru, on the South by Bha1ratavars2a, on the west by Ketuma1la and on the east by Bhadra1s4vavars2a.^95 It is also mentioned in the Padmapura1n2a.^96 and the Ka1lika1pura1n2a.^97 According to the Ka1lika1pura1n2a S4iva saw the summit of it. We also learn from this text that the Jambu river flows from this mountain.^98 We also find the mention of the Meru in the S4is4upa1lavadha of Ma1gha. It was on account of the eminence of Sumeru among the mountains that for praising kings they were described as ‘Meru’ among kings.^99 This metaphor may have been applied after the contention of the Pura1n2as that the earth is supposed to be like lotus, with four Maha1dvi1pas as its four petals and mount Meru as its pericarp.^100

ऊर्जयत्
4. U1rjayat (No. 14, L. 16): The poet here draws a picture: the lake Sudars4ana looked like the sea^101 and the rivers Pala1s4ini1, (Suvarn2asikata1), etc., had joined it has if the mountain U1rjayat had stretched his hand with flowers (growing on the banks of the trees and thus falling in the rivers) for sending his daughters to their worthy husband.^102 Since the rivers emerged out from the mountain Raivataka, it may be called their father as described in verse 28, but to avoid repetition the poet uses in verse 29 a synonym of its name viz., the U1rjayat and while making it the symbal of father represents the sea as the husband of the rivers.^103 Thus the mountains U1rjayat and the Raivataka are one and the same. We also get support for our suggestion from the fact that whereas the Juna1gar2h Rock Inscription of Rudrada1man describes the emergence of the rivers Pala1s4ini1, Suvarn2sikata1 etc., from the mountain U1rjayat^104 in Inscription No. 14 the name of Raivataka is used in the same context.^105 Fleet^106 and Sircar^107 are wrong in describing Raivataka as a hill different from U1rjayat or Girnar situated opposite to it. The  Vividhati1rthakalpa also uses the names Raivataka and the Ujjayant (U1rjayat) as synonyms for Girinara which was sanctified by S4ri1nemi and is situated in Sura1s2t2ra (South Kathiawad).^108 In another inscription at Girna1r (about 15th century) verses 5-8 refer to the mountain Girna1r by both the names Ujjayanata and Raivata.^109 The Abhidha1nacinta1man2i of Hemacandra also mentions Ujjayanta and Raivataka as synonyms.^110 The Kap copper-plate of Ket2adi Sada1s4iva-Na1yaka also refers to Ujjantagiri (U1rjayat).^111 The mountain U1rjayat is identified with Girnar hill near Juna1gar2h.^112 The literal meaning of U1rjayat is strong, powerful, eminent.^113

विष्णुपद
5. Vis2n2upada (No. 20, L. 6): We know from the inscription that a lofty standard of the divine Vis2n2u was set up on the hill called Vis2n2upada.^114 Literally meaning ‘the hill marked with footprints of Vis2n2u’, Vis2n2upada hill has been identified with that part of the Delhi Ridge on which the column stands.^115 But there is no mountain in Delhi and the inscription appears to have been brought there from the mount Vis2n2upada.^116 On the evidence from the Epics, this Vis2n2upada hill is not far from Kurukshetra and the Beas.^117
