2. Aks2a. --This word occurs frequently, from the Rigveda onwards, both in the singular and plural, meaning ‘die’ and ‘dice.’ Dicing, along with horse-racing, was one of the main amusements of the Vedic Indian; but, despite the frequent mention of the game in the literature, there is considerable difficulty in obtaining any clear picture of the mode in which it was played. (1) The Material.--The dice appear normally to have been made of Vibhi1daka nuts. Such dice are alluded to in both the Rigveda 1) vii. 86, 6; x. 34, 1. and the Atharvaveda, 2) Av. Paipp. xx. 4, 6. hence being called ‘brown’ (babhru), and ‘born on a windy spot.’ 3) Rv. x. 34, 5; Av. vii. 114, 7; Rv. x. 34, 1. In the ritual game of dice at the Agnya1dheya and the Ra1jasu1ya ceremonies the material of the dice is not specified, but it is possible that occasionally gold imitations of Vibhi1daka nuts were used. 4) Sa1yan2a on Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 6, 12; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 6. There is no clear trace in the Vedic literature of the later use of cowries as dice. 5) Sa1yan2a, loc. cit., and on Rv. i. 41, 9; Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 28. (2) The Number.--In the Rigveda 6) x. 34, 12. the dicer is described as ‘leader of a great horde’ (sena1ni1r mahato gan2asya), and in another passage 7) x. 34, 8. the number is given as tri-pan5ca1s4ah2, an expression which has been variously interpreted. Ludwig, 8) See his translation. Weber, 9) U7ber das Ra1ja1su1ya, 72. and Zimmer 10) Altindisches Leben, 284. render it as fifteen, which is grammatically hardly possible. Roth 11) Following Sa1yan2a on Rv. x. 34, 8. and Grassmann 12) In his translation. render it as ‘consisting of fifty-three.’ Lu7ders 13) Das Wu7rfelspiel im alten Indien, 25. takes it as ‘consisting of one hundred and fifty,’ but he points out that this may be merely a vague expression for a large number. For a small number Zimmer 14) Op. cit., 283. cites a reference in the Rigveda 15) i. 41, 9. to one who fears ‘him who holds four’ (caturas4 cid dadama1na1t), but the sense of that passage is dependent on the view taken of the method of playing the game. (3) The Method of Play.--In several passages of the later Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as lists are given of expressions connected with dicing. The names are Kr2ta, Treta1, Dva1para, A1skanda, and Abhibhu1 in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 16) iv. 3, 3, 1. 2. In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 17) xxx. 18. among the victims at the Purus2amedha, the kitava is offered to the Aks2ara1ja, the a1dinava-dars4a to the Kr2ta, the kalpin to the Treta1, the adhi-kalpin to the Dva1para, the sabha1-stha1n2u to the A1skanda. The lists in the parallel version of the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a are kitava, sabha1vin, a1dinavadars4a, bahih2-sad, and sabha1-stha1n2u, 18) iii. 4, 1, 16. These must be persons conversant with dicing, but the exact sense of the names is unknown. and Aksara1ja, Kr2ta, Treta1, Dva1para, and Kali. From the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 19) v. 4, 4, 6. it appears that another name of Kali was Abhibhu1, and the parallel lists in the Taittiri1ya and Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1s suggest that Abhibhu1 and Aks2ara1ja are identical, though both appear in the late Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a list. The names of some of these throws go back even to the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda. Kali occurs in the latter, 20) vii. 114, 1. and Lu7ders 21) Op. cit., 43 et seq, shows that in a considerable number of passages in the former Kr2ta means a ‘throw’ (not ‘a stake’ 22) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or ‘what is won’ 23) Grassmann's Dictionary, s.v. and this sense is clearly found in the Atharvaveda. 24) vii. 52. See Rv. x. 42, 9 (kr2tam2 vicinoti); 43, 5; x. 102, 2; v. 60, 1; ix. 97, 58; i. 132, 1; x. 34, 6; i. 100, 9; viii. 19, 10. Moreover, that there were more throws (aya1h2) than one is proved by a passage in the Rigveda, 25) x. 116, 9. when the gods are compared to throws as giving or destroying wealth. The nature of the throws is obscure. The St. Petersburg Dictionary conjectures that the names given above were applied either to dice marked 4, 3, 2, or 1, or to the sides of the dice so marked, and the latter interpretation is supported by some late commentators. 26) A1nandagiri on Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 4; Ni1lakan2t2ha on Maha1bha1rata, iv. 50, 24. But there is no evidence for the former interpretation, and, as regards the latter, the shape of the Vibhi1daka nuts, 27) Lu7ders, op. cit., 18. used as dice, forbids any side being properly on the top. Light is thrown on the expressions by the descrip tion of a ritual game 28) Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 8; 9; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, v, 19, 4; 20, 1, with Rudradatta's note, for the Agnya1dheya. A1pastamba, xviii. 18, 16 st seq., describes the Ra1jasu1ya game, and cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 10, 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 6; Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, xv. 7, 5 et seq. For Kr2ta as four, see S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 2, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 11, 1. at the Agnya1dheya and at the Ra1jasu1ya ceremonies. The details are not certain, 29) See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 62, 123 et seq. but it is clear that the game consisted in securing even numbers of dice, usually a number divisible by four, the Kr2ta, the other three throws then being the Treta1, when three remained over after division by four; the Dva1para, when two was the remainder; and the Kali, when one remained. If five were the dividing number, then the throw which showed no remainder was Kali, the Kr2ta was that when four was left, and so on. The dice had no numerals marked on them, the only question being what was the total number of the dice themselves. There is no reason to doubt that the game as played in the Rigveda was based on the same principle, though the details must remain doubtful. The number of dice used was certainly large, 30) Rv. x. 34, 8. and the reference to throwing fours, 31) Rv. i. 41, 9. In x. 34, 2, the loss is ascribed to aks2asya ekaparasya, which confirms the explanation of Dva1para given in Pa1n2in2i, ii. 1, 10. and losing by one, points to the use of the Kr2ta as the winning throw. The Atharvaveda, 32) vii. 114, 1. on the other hand, possibly knew of the Kali as the winning throw. In one respect the ordinary game must have differed from the ritual game. In the latter the players merely pick out the number of dice required--no doubt to avoid ominous errors, such as must have happened if a real game had been played. In the secular game the dice were thrown, 33) Rv. x. 34, 1. 8. 9; Av. iv. 38, 3. perhaps on the principle suggested by Lu7ders: 34) Op. cit. 56. the one throwing a certain number on the place of playing, and the other then throwing a number to make up with those already thrown a multiple of four or five. This theory, at any rate, accounts for the later stress laid on the power of computation in a player, as in the Nala. No board appears to have been used, but a depression on which the dice were thrown (adhi-devana, devana, 35) Adhidevana in Av. v. 31, 6; vi. 70, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1; i. 6, 11; iv. 4, 6, etc.; devana in Rv. x. 43, 5. The falling of the dice on the ground is referred to in Av. vii. 114, 2. irin2a 36) Rv. x. 34, 1. ), was made in the ground. No dice box was used, but reference is made to a case for keeping dice in (aks2a-vapana 37) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 11. The throw was called graha 38) Av. iv. 38, 1 et seq.; cf. vii. 114, 5. or earlier gra1bha. 39) Rv. viii. 81, 1; ix. 106, 3. The stake is called vij. 40) Rv. i. 92, 10; ii. 12, 5; laks2a in ii. 12, 4, and often dhana. So Lu7ders, op. cit., 10, n. 5; 62, n. 1. Roth and Zimmer, op. cit., 286, render ‘he makes the dice secretly disappear’ (i. 92, 10). Serious losses could be made at dicing: in the Rigveda a dicer laments the loss of all his property, including his wife. 41) Rv. x. 34, 2. For cheating at play cf. Rv. v, 85, 8; vii. 86, 6; 104 14; Av. vi. 118. Lu7ders 42) Op. cit., 61. finds a different form of the game referred to in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 43) iv. 1, 4; 6. According to Ni1lakan2t2ha on Harivam2s4a, ii. 61, 39, the stake was divided into ten parts, and the Kali then took one, the Dva1para three, the Treta1 six, and the Kr2ta all ten. This explanation seems harsh. Cf. Roth, Gurupu1ja1kaumudi1, 1-4; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 283-287; Lu7ders, Das Wu7rfelspiel im alten Indien; Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 62, 123 et seq.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 823 et seq.

Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 17, 562. renders ‘not caused by cutting’ and ‘caused by cutting.’ Formerly 3) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, cxvii. et seq. he suggested ‘tumour’ or ‘boil.’ Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda 442. thinks that two varieties of Ja1ya1nya are meant. Ludwig 5) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 500. reads with Sa1yana aks2ita, which he renders by ‘not firmly established’ in the invalid.

Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders it by ‘net,’ while Bo7htlingk 4) Dictionary, s.v. suggests ‘axle of a car.’ Geldner 5) Vedische Studien, 1, 136. sees in it a stake or pole used with a fishermen's net (Ja1la), 6) Av. viii. 8, 18. the pole of a wagon, 7) Av. i. 180, 5. and the pole of a house, whether vertical or horizontal, he leaves uncertain (see Vam2s4a). 8) ix. 3, 18. Bloomfield 9) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 598. takes it as a covering of wickerwork stretched across a beam and sloping down to both sides--like a thatched roof, and this best explains the epithet ‘thousand-eyed’ (i.e., with countless holes) ascribed to it. In the other Atharvaveda passage 10) Av. viii. 8, 18. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153, 265; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 506, 526; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 179. he accepts the sense ‘net,’ and doubts if the word in the Rigveda is not an adjective (a-ks2u) as it is taken by Sa1yan2a.

अगस्त्य
अगस्त्य
 --This is the name of a sage, of mythical character, who plays a great part in the later literature. He was a Ma1na, 1) Rv. vii. 33, 10 (Agastya), 13 (Ma1na). and therefore is called Ma1nya 2) Rv. i. 165, 15 = 166, 15 = 167, 11 = 168, 10; 165, 14; 177, 5; 184, 4 (Ma1nya); i. 189, 8; 117, 11 (Ma1nasya su1nu). and son of Ma1na, and only once is there a reference 3) Rv. vii. 33, 13. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 138 et seq. to the legend prevalent in latter times that he was a son of Mitra and Varun2a. His greatest feat was the reconciliation of Indra and the Maruts after Indra had been annoyed at his proposing to give the Maruts an offering to the exclusion of Indra. This feat is the subject of three hymns of the Rigveda, 4) Rv. i. 165; 170; 171. and is often referred to in the Bra1hman2as, 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 5, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 11, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 11; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxi. 14, 5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 16; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxvi. 9. though the exact details and significance of the legend are variously treated by Oldenberg, 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 39, 60 et seq. Sieg, 7) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 108-119. Hertel, 8) Vienna Oriental Journal, 18, 152-154. and von Schroeder. 9) Mysterium und Mimus im Rigveda, 91 et seq. He also appears in a strange dialogue with Lopa1mudra1 in the Rigveda, 10) i. 179. Cf. Sieg, op. cit., 120-126; Oldenberg, op. cit., 66-68. which appears to show him as an ascetic who finally yields to temptation. Von Schroeder 11) Op. cit., 156-172. regards it as a ritual drama of vegetation magic. In another passage of the Rigveda 12) i. 117, 11; cf. i. 116, 15. he appears as helping in the As4vins’ gift of a leg to Vis4pala1. Sa1yan2a holds that be was the Purohita of Khela, and Sieg 13) Op. cit., 128. accepts this view, while Pischel 14) Vedische Studien, 1, 171-173. thinks that Khela is a deity, Vivasvant. Geldner 15) Vedische Studien, 2, 138, 143. shows from the Rigveda 16) Rv. vii. 33, 10. 13. that Agastya, as brother of Vasis2t2ha--both being miraculous sons of Mitra and Varun2a -introduces Vasis2t2ha to the Tr2tsus. There are two other references to Agastya in the Rigveda, the one 17) vii. 5, 26. Sieg, 129, suggests that this refers to the Khela legend. including him in a long list of persons, the other alluding to his sister's sons (nadbhyah2), 18) x. 60, 6. apparently Bandhu, etc. In the Atharvaveda 19) ii. 32, 3; iv. 37, 1. Perhaps for this reason the Rigveda Anukraman2i1 ascribes to him (Rv. i. 191) a magic hymn. he appears as connected with witchcraft, and in a long list of sages. 20) xviii. 3, 15. In the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 21) iv. 2, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 117; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 106-129; Macdonell, Br2haddevata1, 2, 136 et seq.; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 221; R2gveda-Noten, 1, 110. cows, with a peculiar mark on their ears (vis2t2ya-karn2yah2), are associated with him.

अग्निदग्ध
अग्नि-दग्ध
 --This epithet (‘burnt with fire’) 1) Rv. x. 15, 14; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 1, 7; dagdha1h2, Av. xviii. 2, 34. applies to the dead who were burned on the funeral pyre. This is one of the two normal methods of disposing of the dead, the other being burial (an-agnidagdha1h2, ‘not burnt with fire’). 2) Rv., loc. cit.; = nikha1ta1h2, Av. xviii. 2, 34. The Atharvaveda 3) Loc. cit. adds two further modes of disposal to those-viz., casting out (paropta1h2), and the exposure of the dead (uddhita1h2). The exact sense of these expressions is doubtful. Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 402. considers that the former is a parallel to the Iranian practice of casting out the dead to be devoured by beasts, and that the latter refers to the old who are exposed when helpless. 5) Rv. viii. 51, 2. Whitney 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 841. refers the latter expression to the exposure of the dead body on a raised platform of some sort. Burial was clearly not rare in the Rigvedic period: a whole hymn 7) x. 18. The interpretation of v. 8 is a famous crux, see Patni1. describes the ritual attending it. The dead man was buried apparently in full attire, with his bow in his hand, and probably at one time his wife was immolated to accompany him, in accordance with a practice common among savage tribes. But in the Vedic period both customs appear in a modified form: the son takes the bow from the hand of the dead man, and the widow is led away from her dead husband by his brother or other nearest kinsman. A stone is set between the dead and the living to separate them. In the Atharvaveda, 8) xviii. 2, 25; 3, 70. but not in the Rigveda, a coffin (vr2ks2a) is alluded to. In both Sam2hita1s 9) Rv. vii. 89, 1; Av. v. 30, 14; xviii. 2, 52. occur other allusions to the ‘house of earth’ (bhu1mi-gr2ha). To remove the apparent discrepancy between burning and burial, by assuming that the references to burial are to the burial of the burned bones, as does Oldenberg, 10) Religion des Veda, 571. is unnecessary and improbable, as burning and burial subsisted side by side in Greece for many years. Burning was, however, equally usual, and it grew steadily in frequency, for in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 11) viii. 8. 5. the adornment of the body of the dead with curd (A1miks2a1), clothes, and ornaments, in order to win the next world, is referred to as something erroneous and wrong, and in the funeral Mantras of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 12) xxxv. Cf. also Kaus4ika Su1tra, 80 et seq., which treats the Atharvaveda hymns, xviii. 1-3, as intended for burning only. only burning seems to be contemplated; the verses which refer to burial here really alluding to the burial of the ashes in the burying-ground (s4mas4a1na). 13) Av. v. 31, 8; x. 1, 18; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 8, 5; 4, 11, 3. The body was wrapped in fat, 14) Rv. x. 16, 7. as we learn from the funeral hymn in the Rigveda, a goat being apparently burned with it, 15) Rv. x. 16, 4. But aja may mean ‘the unborn part,’ as Weber prefers to take it, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 847. to act as a guide on the way to the next world. According to the Atharvaveda 16) xii. 2, 48. a draft-ox was burned presumably for the dead to ride with in the next world. It was expected that the dead would revive with his whole body and all his limbs (sarva-tanu1h2 sa1n3gah2), 17) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 6, 1, 1; xi. 1, 8, 6; xii. 8, 3, 31. Cf. Av. xi. 3, 32. This fact probably explains the use of s4es2ah2 in Rv. x. 16, 5. The dead enjoy sexual pleasures in the next world; see Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 307, n. 462. although it is also said 18) Rv. x. 16, 3. that the eye goes to the sun, the breath to the wind, and so forth. Before burial or burning, the corpse was washed, 19) Av. v. 19, 14. a clog (ku1di1) being tied to the foot to prevent the deceased returning to earth. 20) Av. v. 19, 12; see Roth, Festgruss an Bo7htlingk, 98; Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 12, 416.

It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the reading of the Rigveda was deliberately altered because of the connection of the slaughter of kine with sin (agha)--possibly, too, with a further desire to emphasize the contrast with aghnya1, a name for ‘cow.’ Moreover, in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 3) iii. 1, 4, 8.

Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, 1, 578. and thinks that the An3kau were the upper border of the body of the chariot (kos4a, vandhura), and the Nyan3kau the lower rims for greater security. Oldenberg 5) Sacred Books of the East, 29, 364, on Pa1raskara Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 14, 6. confesses that the exact sense is impossible to make out, but considers that the terms at once refer to parts of the chariot and to divinities, while Bo7htlingk 6) Dictionary, s.v. takes the term as referring to divinities alone. 

अङ्ग
अङ्ग
 --The name occurs only once in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 22, 14. in connection with the Gandha1ris, Mu1javants, and Magadhas, as distinct peoples. They appear also in the Gopatha Bra1hman2a 2) ii. 9. in the compound name An3ga-magadha1h2. As in later times they were settled on the Sone and Ganges, 3) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 35; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 446, 449; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 852, inclines to regard them as a non-Aryan people that came over-sea to Eastern India. There is nothing in the Vedic literature to throw light on this hypothesis. their earlier seat was presumably there also. See also Van3ga.

अङ्गवैरोचन
अङ्ग वैरोचन
 --He is included in the list of anointed kings in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) viii. 22. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 214. His Purohita was Udamaya, an A1treya.

अङ्गारावक्षयण
अङ्गारावक्षयण
 --A word of doubtful meaning found in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) iii. 9, 18. It is rendered ‘tongs’ by Max Mu7ller and Bo7htlingk in their translations. The St. Petersburg Dictionary explains it as ‘a vessel in which coals are extinguished,’ and Monier-Williams as ‘an instrument for extinguishing coals.’ The smaller St. Petersburg Dictionary renders the word ‘coal-shovel or tongs.’ Cf. Ulmuka1vaks2ayan2a.

अङ्गिरस्
अङ्गिरस्
 --The An3girases appear in the Rigveda 1) Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, ii. 156-169. as semimythical beings, and no really historical character can be assigned even to those passages 2) Rv. i. 45, 3; 139, 9; iii. 31, 7, etc.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 2, 10. which recognize a father of the race, An3giras. Later, however, there were definite families of An3girases, to whose ritual practices (ayana, dvira1tra) references are made. 3) Av. xviii. 4, 8, but this may be mythical; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xx. 11, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 4, 1. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 142, 143.

अज
अज, अजा
 --This is the ordinary name for goat in the Rigveda 1) Aja in Rv. x. 16, 4; i. 162, 2. 4; Av. ix. 5, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 9, etc.; aja1 in Rv. viii. 70, 15; Av. vi. 71, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii., 56, etc. and the later literature. The goat is also called Basta, Cha1ga, Chagala. Goats and sheep (aja1vayah2) are very frequently mentioned together. 2) Rv. x. 90, 10; Av. viii. 7, 25; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 43, etc. The female goat is spoken of as producing two or three kids, 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 10, 1. and goat's milk is well known. 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 6, 1; v. 1, 7, 4. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 364, n. 4. The goat as representative of Pu1s2an plays an important part in the ritual of burial. 5) Rv. x. 16, 4, etc. Cf. p. 9. The occupation of a goatherd (ajapa1la) was a recognized one, being distinguished from that of a cowherd and of a shepherd. 6) Va1jasaneyi1 Sam2hita1, xxx. 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 9, 1.

अज
अज
 --The Ajas are named in one verse of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18. 19. as having been defeated by the Tr2tsus under Suda1s. They are there mentioned with the Yaks2us and S4igrus, and Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 127, Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. conjectures that they formed part of a confederacy under Bheda against Suda1s. The name has been regarded as a sign of totemism, 3) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 153; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 929; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 200, 21; Risley, Peoples of India, 83 et seq. but this is very uncertain, and it is impossible to say if they were or were not A1ryans.

 (‘goat-swallower’) occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 2, 25; xx. 129, 17. and in the list of animals at the As4vamedha, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 5, 14, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii, 14, 19; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 38. or horse sacrifice, as the name of the boa-constrictor. Elsewhere 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 13, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 34. it is called Va1hasa. It denotes a person at the snake feast in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 4) xxv. 15, in the form of Ajaga1va, with which cf. Ajaka1va.

अजमीढ
अज-मीढ
 --The A1jami1d2has, or descendants of Ajami1d2ha, are referred to in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) iv. 44, 6. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 123, 135. and Oldenberg 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215. deduce from the use of this patronymic that Ajami1d2ha was the seer of that hymn.

अजशृङ्गी
अज-शृङ्गी
 --This plant (‘goat's horn’), equated by the commentator with Vis2a1n2in (the Odina pinnata), is celebrated as a demon-destroyer in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 37. Its other name is Ara1t2aki1. 2) iv. 37, 6. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 18, 144. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 408, 409; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 89. suggests that it is the Prosopis spicigera or Mimosa suma.

अजातशत्रु

 --He is mentioned as a King of Ka1s4i1 (Ka1s4ya) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka 1) ii. 1, 1. and Kaus2i1taki 2) iv. 1. Upanis2ads, where he instructs the proud Bra1hman2a Ba1la1ki as to the real nature of the self. He is not to be identified with the Aja1tasattu of the Buddhist texts. 3) Cf.

अज्ञातयक्ष्म
अज्ञात-यक्ष्म,
 the ‘unknown sickness,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) x. 161, 1 = Av. iii. 11, 1. Atharvaveda, 2) vi. 127, 3. and Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 3) xiii. 16. It is referred to in connection with Ra1jayaks2ma. Grohmann 4) Indische Studien, 9, 400. thinks that the two are different forms of disease, hypertrophy and atrophy, the purpose of the spell in the Rigveda being thus the removal of all disease. From the Atharvaveda 5) vi. 127. 3. he deduces its identity with Bala1sa. Zimmer, 6) Altindisches Leben, 377, 378. Cf. Bloomfield. Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 342; Atharvaveda, 60; Jolly, Medicin (in Bu7hler's Encyclopædia), 89. however, points out that this conclusion is unjustified, leaving the disease unidentified, which seems to accord with its name.

अजिन
अजिन
 --This word denotes generally the skin of an animal -e.g., a gazelle, 1) Av. v. 21, 7. as well as that of a goat (Aja). 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 1, 21. 24. The use of skins as clothing is shown by the adjective ‘clothed in skins’ (ajina-va1sin) in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) iii. 9, 1, 12. and the furrier's trade is mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 4) xxx. 15 (ajina-sam2dha); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 13, 1 (ajinasam2dha1ya). The Maruts also wear deer-skins, 5) Rv. i. 166, 10. and the wild ascetics (muni) of a late Rigveda hymn 6) x. 136, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262. seem to be clad in skins (Mala).

अतिथि
अतिथि
 (‘guest’).--A hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 6. celebrates in detail the merits of hospitality. The guest should be fed before the host eats, water should be offered to him, and so forth. The Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad 2) i. 11, 2. also lays stress on hospitality, using the expression ‘one whose deity is his guest’ (atithi-deva). In the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 3) i. 1, 1. it is said that only the good are deemed worthy of receiving hospitality. The guest-offering forms a regular part of the ritual, 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 3, 2, 1. and cows were regularly slain in honour of guests. 5) Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 426; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 79.

अतिथिग्व
अतिथि-ग्व
 --This name occurs frequently in the Rigveda, apparently applying, in nearly all cases, to the same king, otherwise called Divoda1sa. The identity of the two persons has been denied by Bergaigne, 1) Religion Ve4dique, 2, 342 et seq. but is certainly proved by a number of passages, when the two names occur together, 2) Rv. i. 51, 6; 112, 14; 130, 7; iv. 26, 3; vi. 47, 22. in connection with the defeat of S4ambara. In other passages 3) Rv. i. 53, 8; x. 48, 8. Atithigva is said to have assisted Indra in slaying Parn2aya and Karan5ja. Sometimes he is only vaguely referred to, while once 5) Rv. vii. 19, 8. There is no ground for assuming the reference here to be to a later Atithigva. he is mentioned as an enemy of Turvas4a and Yadu. Again 6) Rv. i. 53, 10; ii. 14, 7; vi. 18, 13; viii. 53, 2. Atithigva is coupled with A1yu and Kutsa as defeated by Tu1rvaya1n2a. A different Atithigva appears to be referred to in a Da1nastuti 7) Rv. viii. 68, 16. 17. (‘Praise of Gifts’), where his son, Indrota, is mentioned. Roth 8) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 123; Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 426, who renders the name ‘presenting cows to guests.’ distinguishes three Atithigvas--the Atithigva Divoda1sa, the enemy of Parn2aya and Karan5ja, and the enemy of Tu1rvaya1n2a. But the various passages can be reconciled, especially if it is admitted that Atithigva Divoda1sa was already an ancient hero in the earliest hymns, and was becoming almost mythical. 4) Rv. vi. 26, 3.

अतिधन्वन्शौनक

अत्क
1. Atka. --This word occurs frequently in the Rigveda, but its sense is doubtful. Roth, Grassmann, Ludwig, Zimmer, 1) Altindisches Leben, 262. and others render it as ‘garment’ in several passages, 2) i. 95, 7; ii. 35, 14; iv. 18, 5; v. 55, 6; 74, 5; vi. 29, 3; viii. 41, 7; ix. 101, 14; 107, 13; Sa1maveda, ii. 1193. when the expressions ‘put on’ (vya1 or prati mun5c) or ‘put off’ (mun5c) are used of it, and when it is said to be ‘woven’ (vyuta) 3) Rv. i. 122, 2. or ‘wellfitting’ (surabhi). 4) Rv. vi. 29, 3; x. 123, 7. On the other hand, Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 193-204. denies that this sense occurs, and otherwise explains the passages. He takes the term to mean ‘axe’ in four places. 6) Rv. v. 55, 6; vi. 33, 3; x. 49, 3; 99, 9. Cf. Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 94, n. 1.

अत्क
2. Atka. --In two passages of the Rigveda 1) x. 49, 3; 99, 9. this word is regarded as a proper name by Roth, Grassmann, and Ludwig. But Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 262, 297. explains it in these passages as the ‘armour of a warrior as a whole,’ and Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 195. thinks that in both cases an ‘axe’ is meant.

अत्यंहसारुणि
अत्य्-अंहस् आरुणि
 --According to the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (iii. 10, 9, 3-5), this teacher sent a pupil to question Plaks2a Dayya1m2pati as to the Sa1vitra (a form of Agni). For this impertinence his pupil was severely rebuked.

अत्यरातिजानंतपि
अत्य्-अराति जानं-तपि,
 though not a prince, was taught the Ra1jasu1ya by Va1sis2t2ha Satyahavya, and thereupon conquered the earth. When Va1sis2t2ha reminded him of his indebtedness, and claimed a great reward, the warrior replied irascibly that he intended to conquer the Uttara Kurus, and that Va1sis2t2ha would then become King of the Earth, Atyara1ti himself being his general (sena1-pati). Va1sis2t2ha replied that as no mortal man could conquer the Uttara Kurus he was cheated of his reward. He consequently procured Atyara1ti's defeat and death at the hands of Amitratapana S4us2min2a S4aibya. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 23. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 214.

अत्रि
अत्रि
 --Neither Atri himself nor the Atris can claim any historical reality, 1) For Atri in the Rigveda, see Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 145. Cf. also Av. ii. 32, 3; iv. 29, 3; Mantra Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 1; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iv. 36, etc.; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 2, 4. beyond the fact that Man2d2ala V. of the Rigveda is attributed, no doubt correctly, to the family of the Atris. 2) Cf. Rv. v. 39, 5; 67, 5; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 3; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii, 2, 1. The Atris as a family probably stood in close relations with the Priyamedhas 3) Cf. Rv. i. 45, 3; 139, 9; viii. 5, 25; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 22. and Kan2vas, 4) Cf. Rv. i. 118, 7; v. 41, 4; x. 150, 5. perhaps also with the Gotamas 5) Cf. Rv. i. 183, 5. and Ka1ks2i1vatas. 6) Cf. Rv. x. 143, 1. The mention of both the Parus2n2i1 and the Yamuna1 in one hymn 7) Rv. v. 52, 9, 17. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 128, 142; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 469; Oldenber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212215; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 310. of the fifth Man2d2ala seems to justify the presumption that the family was spread over a wide extent of territory.

अथरी
अथरी
 --This word occurs only in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 6, 8. and the sense is doubtful. Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. followed by most interpreters, renders it ‘point of a lance,’ but Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 99. thinks that it means ‘an elephant.’

अथर्वन्
अथर्वन्
 --The name in the singular denotes the head of a semi-divine family of mythical priests, 1) See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 141. In the Vam2s4a of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 6, 3, Atharvan Daiva is characteristically the pupil of Mr2tyu. of whom nothing historical can be said. In the plural the family as a whole is meant. In a few places an actual family seems to be referred to. Thus, for instance, they are mentioned as recipients of gifts in the Da1nastuti 2) Rv. vi. 47, 24. (‘Praise of Gifts’), of As4vattha's generosity; their use of milk mingled with honey in the ritual is referred to; 3) Rv. ix. 11, 2. and a cow that miscarries (ava-toka1) from accident is dedicated to the Atharvans, according to the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 4) iii. 4, 11, 1. Cf. Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 15. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxxv. et seq., who (p. xxxviii) takes avatoka1 as a woman, and the Atharvans as the hymns; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 174 et seq.

अथर्वाणः
अथर्वाणः
 --This expression 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 12, 9, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 10, 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 3, 5 et seq. is used with An3girasah2, to denote the Atharvaveda. The compound Atharva1n3girasah2 is employed in the same sense.

अथर्वाङ्गिरसः
अथर्वाङ्गिरसः
 --This is the collective name of the Atharvaveda in several passages 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 12, 8, 2; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 9; 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 6, 7; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 4, 1. 2; Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, ii. 3, 1. of the later Bra1hman2as. It occurs once in the Atharvaveda itself, 2) x. 7, 20. while the term Atharvaveda is not found before the Su1tra period. 3) S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xvi. 2, 9, etc. The compound seems, according to Bloomfield, 4) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, 387 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xviii. et seq. to denote the two elements which make up the Atharvaveda. The former part refers to the auspicious practices of the Veda (bhes2aja1ni); 5) Av. xi. 6, 14. the latter to its hostile witchcraft, the ya1tu 6) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 5, 2, 20. or abhi-ca1ra. 7) Kaus4ika Su1tra, 3, 19. This theory is supported by the names of the two mythic personages Ghora A1n3girasa and Bhis2aj A1tharvan2a, as well as by the connection of Atharva1n2ah2 and A1tharvan2a1ni with healing (bhes2aja) in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 8) xii. 9, 10; xvi. 10, 10. Moreover, the term bhesaja1 (‘remedies’) designates in the Atharvaveda 9) x. 6, 14. that Veda itself, while in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 10) x. 5, 2, 20. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 177. ya1tu (‘sorcery’) conveys the same meaning. The evidence, however, being by no means convincing, it remains probable that there existed no clear differentiation between the two sages as responsible for the Atharvaveda as a whole. 

अदृष्ट
अ-दृष्ट
 --‘The unseen’ is a term used in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 191, 4 = Av. vi. 52, 2. and the Atharvaveda 2) vi. 52, 3. to designate a species of vermin. The sun is also described as ‘the slayer of the unseen’ (adr2s2t2a-han), 3) Rv. i. 191, 9 = Av. vi. 52, 1; Av. v. 23, 6. and as a counterpart a ‘seen’ (dr2s2t2a) is mentioned. 4) Av. ii. 31, 2; viii. 8, 15. In one passage 5) Av. v. 23, 6. 7. the epithets ‘seen’ and ‘unseen’ are applied to the worm (Kr2mi), their use being no doubt due to the widespread theory of diseases being due to worms, whether discernable by examination or not. 6) Kuhn, Zeitschrift fu7r vergleichende Sprachforschung, 13, 135 et seq.; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 313315; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

अद्मसद्
अद्म-सद्
 --This expression (lit. ‘sitting at the meal’), found several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 124, 4; vi. 30, 3; vii. 83, 7; viii. 44, 29; adma-sadvan, vi. 4, 4. is usually rendered ‘guest at the feast,’ but Geldner 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 179, 180; but of Oldenberg, Vedaforschung, 90. adduces reasons to show that it means ‘a fly,’ so called because of its settling on food.

अद्रि
अद्रि
 --Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 301. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. deduces from the use of this word (‘rock,’ ‘stone’) in a passage of the Rigveda, 2) i. 51, 3. that sling-stones were used in Vedic fighting. But the passage is mythical, referring to Indra's aid, and cannot be used with any certainty as evidence for human war. More probably it merely denotes Indra's bolt. See also As4ani.

अधिदेवन
अधि-देवन
 --The place where the dice were thrown is thus designated in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 31, 6; vi. 70, 1. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) v. 4, 4, 20. 22, 23. according to Lu7ders. 3) Das Wu7rfelspiel im alten Indien, 11-13. Roth, 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. followed by Whitney, takes it to mean ‘gambling-board.’ See Aks2a.

अधिराज
अधि-राज
 --The word occurs fairly often throughout the early literature, 1) Rv. x. 128, 9 Av. vi. 98, 1; ix. 10, 24; Taituri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 14, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita, iv. 12, 3; Ka1thaka Sam2hita1, viii. 17; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 2, 9 (adhira1jan); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 2, 2; Nirukta, viii. 2. denoting ‘overlord’ among kings or princes. In no passage is it clear that a real over-king is meant, as the word ra1jan may mean king or merely prince, a person of royal blood. On the whole it seems most probable that the word connotes no more than ‘king’ as opposed to ‘prince.’

अधिषवण

 --The two Adhis2avan2as 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 21; Av. v. 20, 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 4, 1; 5, 3, 22 (adhis2avan2e phalake); Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 32 (adhis2avan2am2 carma, ‘the skin upon which the pressing takes place’; adhis2avan2e phalake, ‘the boards on which the pressing takes place,’ etc.). are usually understood, as by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 277. to designate the two boards between which the Soma was pressed. Hillebrandt, 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 148 et seq. however, shows from the ritual that the boards were not placed one over the other, but were placed one behind the other, the two serving as a foundation upon which the Soma was pressed by a stone. This theory seems to account best for the etymological sense of the name ‘over-press,’ as well as for the use of the word as an adjective (‘used for pressing upon’). But according to the procedure as witnessed by Haug 5) See Haug, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 2, p. 488, n. 10. in the Deccan, the shoots of the plant are first placed on the skin, one of the boards being then laid over them and pounded with a stone. The shoots are then taken out and placed upon the board, the second board being then laid over them.

अधीवास
अधी¤-वास
 --This word 1) Rv. i. 140, 9; 162, 16; x. 5, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 5, 22 (pratimun5c, ‘put on’); 4, 4, 3 (a1-str2, ‘spread out’), etc. denotes the ‘upper garment’ of the Vedic Indian. Its exact nature is not described, but as the king in the ritual set forth in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) v. 3, 5, 19 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 268. puts on first an undergarment, then a garment, and finally an upper garment, it presumably denotes some sort of cloak or mantle.

अध्याण्डा
अध्याण्डा
 --This is a plant mentioned with many others in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xiii. 8, 1, 16). 

अध्रिगु
अध्रि-गु
 --This is the name of a man twice referred to in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 20; viii. 12, 2. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90. as a prote4ge4 of the As4vins and of Indra respectively.

अध्वर्यु
अध्वर्यु
 --In one passage of the Rigveda 1) iii. 7, 7. Hillebrandt 2) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 423. thinks that the five Adhvaryus who are mentioned do not designate actual priests, but refer to the five planets which move about in the heavens like the Adhvaryu priests on the sacrificial ground. See also Graha.

अनग्निदग्ध
अन्-अग्नि-दग्ध,
 ‘not burnt with fire.’ See Agni-dagdha, ‘burnt with fire.’

अनड्वाह्
अनड्-वाह्
 (lit. ‘cart-drawer’).--This is the common 1) Rv. x. 59, 10; 85, 10; iii. 53, 18; Av. iii. 11, 5; iv. 11, 1, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 14; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 4, 17, etc. name of oxen as employed for drawing carts (Anas). Such oxen were normally castrated, 2) Cf. Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 1, 5 (anad2va1n sa1n2d2ah2). though not always. Female draft cattle were also used (anad2uhi1), but rarely. 3) Av. iv. 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v, 3, 4, 11. 13. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 151, n.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 226. See also Go1.

अनस्
अनस्
 --This is the term 1) Rv. iv. 30, 10; x. 85, 10; 86, 18, etc.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 5, etc.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vii. 15, 1; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 8, etc. used to designate the draft wagon, as opposed to the chariot (ratha) for war or sport, with which it is sometimes expressly contrasted, 2) Rv. iii. 33, 9. though Indra is once said to be ‘seated in a wagon’ (anar-vis4) 3) Rv. i. 121, 7. instead of on a chariot. Though Us2as, Goddess of Dawn, sometimes rides on a chariot (ratha), the wagon is her characteristic vehicle. 4) Rv. ii. 15, 6; iv. 30, 11; viii. 91, 7; x. 73, 6; 138, 5. Of its construction we know little. The bridal wagon on which Su1rya1, the daughter of the Sun, was borne in the marriage hymn in the Rigveda had a covering (Chadis). 5) Rv. x. 85, 10. The axle-box (Kha) is also mentioned. 6) Rv. viii. 91, 7; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 3. In the Atharvaveda 7) xv. 2, 1. Vipatha appears to denote a rough vehicle used for bad tracks. The wagon was usually drawn by oxen (Anad2va1h), as in wedding processions. 8) Rv. x. 85, 11 The wagon of Dawn is described as drawn by ruddy cows or bulls. 9) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 47. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 246; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 4.

अनितभा
अनितभा
 in the Rigveda 1) v. 53. 9. is taken by Max Mu7ller 2) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 323; but of. Rasa1. to denote some river.

अनु
अनु, आनव
 --Grassmann and Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary. see in these words designations of people foreign to the Aryans. But it is clear 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 125. that they denote a special people, the Anus, who are mentioned with the Yadus, Turvas4as, Druhyus, and Pu1rus, 3) Rv. i. 108, 8. with the Druhyus, 4) Rv. vii. 18, 14. and with the Turvas4as, Yadus, and Druhyus. 5) viii. 10, 5. It is also a fair conclusion from their mention in a passage of the Rigveda 6) Rv. viii. 74. 15, compared with vii. 18, 14. that they dwelt on the Parus2n2i1. The inference that the Bhr2gus were connected with this tribe is much more doubtful, 7) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 221, n. 1. for it rests solely on the fact that in one place 8) Rv. vii. 18, 4. the Bhr2gus and Druhyus are mentioned together, and not Anus and Druhyus. A1nava is used as an epithet of Agni, 9) Rv. viii. 74, 4. Cf. Rv. v. 31, 4, where the Anus prepare the chariot of the As4vins. but also in the sense of ‘Anu prince,’ 10) Rv. vii. 18, 13. in one case in conjunction with Turvas4a. 11) viii. 4, 1. Apparently as prince also in vi. 62, 9. Cf. Kurun3ga. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 205; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 153; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 154.

अनुक्षत्तृ
अनु-क्षत्तृ
 --This word occurs in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha, 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 11; 73; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 9, 1. and means, according to Mahi1dhara, 2) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. ‘an attendant on the door-keeper,’ and, according to Sa1yan2a, ‘an attendant on the charioteer’ (sa1rathi). See also Ks2attr2. 3) On Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. 

अनुचर
अनु-चर
 --This is a general expression 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 13; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 7, 1. for an ‘attendant’ (the feminine being Anucari1), 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 27 (apparently slave girls are meant, 400 being enumerated). but it is not often used.

अनुवक्तृसत्यसात्यकीर्त
अनु-वक्तृ सत्य सात्य-कीर्त
 is mentioned as a teacher in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a Upanis2ad (i. 5, 4).

अनुव्याख्यान
अनुव्या-ख्यान
 is a species of writing referred to in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11. S4an3kara interprets it as ‘explanation of the Mantras.’ As the term, in the plural, follows Su1tras, this interpretation is reasonable. Sieg, 2) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 34. however, equates the word with Anva1khya1na, ‘supplementary narrative.’

अनुशासन
अनु-शासन
 in the plural denotes in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xi. 5, 6, 8) some form of literature; according to Sa1yan2a, the Veda1n3gas.

अनुशिख
अनु-शिख
 is the name of the Potr2 at the snake festival in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

अन्तेवासिन्
अन्ते-वासिन्,
 ‘dwelling near,’ is the epithet of the Brahmaca1rin who lives in the house of his teacher. The expression does not occur before the late Bra1hman2a period. 1) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 5, 17; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 7; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 11, 5; iv. 10, 1; Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, i. 3, 3; 11, 1. Secrecy is often enjoined on others than Anteva1sins. 2) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 6; Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii, 11.

अन्ध्र
अन्ध्र
 is the name of a people, and is mentioned with the Pun2d2ras, S4abaras, Pulindas, and Mu1tibas, as being the outcasts resulting from the refusal of the fifty eldest sons of Vis4va1mitra to accept his adoption of S4unah2s4epa. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 18; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 26, where instead of uda1ntyah2 (‘beyond the borders’) the reading is udan5cah2 (‘northern’), but the former is obviously correct. The Sa1n3kha1yana omits the Pulindas, and has Mu1ci1pas. It may fairly be deduced from this statement that these people were recognized as nonAryan, as the Andhras certainly seem to have been. 2) Vincent Smith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 56, 657 et seq., who places them originally in Eastern India between the Kr2s2n2a1 and Goda1vari1 rivers; cf. Rapson, Catalogue of Indian Coins, xv., xvi.; Bhandarkar, Bombay Gazetteer, 1. ii. 138.

अन्यतःप्लक्षा
अन्यतः-प्लक्षा
 (‘with wave-leafed fig-trees on one side only’) is the name of a lake in Kuruks2etra according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) xi. 5, 1, 4. where it occurs in the story of Puru1ravas and Urvas4i1. Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 217. places it somewhere in Sirmor.

अन्यवाप
अन्य-वाप
 (‘sowing for others’).--The cuckoo is so called 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 37; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 18. from its habit of depositing its eggs in the nests of other birds

अन्वाख्यान
अन्वा-ख्यान
 --From the literal translation (‘after-story’) the meaning of ‘supplementary narrative’ seems to follow. In two 1) vi. 5, 2, 22; 6, 4, 7 (the reference is to vi. 6, 4, 8). of its three occurrences in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a this sense is hardly felt, the expression being used to indicate a subsequent portion of the book itself. But in the third 2) xi. 1, 6, 9. Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 34. passage it is distinguished from the Itiha1sa (‘story’) proper, and there must mean ‘supplementary narrative.’ Cf. Anuvya1khya1na.

अपचित्
अप-चित्
 --This word occurs several times in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 25, 1; 83, 1; vii. 75, 1; 77, 1. It is held by Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 97. So also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, {??} 342, 500. and others to denote an insect whose sting produced swellings, etc. (glau). But Bloomfield 4) American Journal of Philology, 11, 320 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 503, 504. Cf. Jolly, Medicin, 89; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 343. shows that the disease, scrofulous swellings, is what is really meant, as is shown by the rendering (gan2d2a-ma1la1, ‘inflammation of the glands of the neck’) of Kes4ava and Sa1yan2a, and by the parallelism of the later disease, apaci1, the derivation being from apa and ci, ‘to pick off.’ 

अपश्रय
अप-श्रय
 See Upas4raya.

अपस्कम्भ
अप-स्कम्भ
 --The word occurs only in one passage of the Atharvaveda, where the tip of it is mentioned as poisoned. Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The passage is Av. iv. 6, 4. suggests that the fastening of the arrow-point to the shaft is meant. Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 153. inclines to this version, but suggests corruption of text. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 300. follows Roth. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 512. renders the word by ‘barb.’ Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 375. thinks it means ‘tearing (arrow),’ a sense deduced from the etymology.

अपाच्यस्
अपाच्यस्
 --The kings of the ‘Westerners’ are referred to in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 14) in connection with those of the Ni1cyas.

अपान
अपान
 --The word appears repeatedly in the Atharvaveda, 1) Av. ii. 28, 3; v. 30, 12, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 19; 24, etc. and later as one of the vital breaths (Pra1n2a), usually with Pra1n2a, and often with one or more of the other three. Its original sense 2) See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, lv. 261; 56, 556-558, correcting Ewing, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 22, 249 et seq. appears to have been ‘inspiration.’ Its connection with the lower part of the body (na1bhi, ‘navel’), which is found already in the Aitareya Upanis2ad, 3) Aitareya Upanis2ad, i. 4, etc. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 263 et seq. is not unnatural.

अपामार्ग
अपा-मार्ग
 --A plant (Achyranthes aspera) used frequently 1) Atharvaveda, iv. 17, 6; 18, 7; 19, 4; vii. 65, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxv. 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 1, 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 4, 14; xiii. 8, 4, 4. in witchcraft practices, and for medical purposes, especially against Ks2etriya. It is described in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 17, 2. as ‘revertive’ (punah2-sara), either, as Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 67. think, because of its having reverted leaves (a view also accepted by Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 180. ), or because, as Bloomfield 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 394. Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 160, 161; Weber Indische Studien, 18, 94. holds, it wards off a spell by causing it to recoil on its user.

अपलम्ब
अप-लम्ब
 --By this word 1) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 13. Cf. Caland and Henry, L'Agnis2t2oma, 50; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 79. is denoted a brake or drag, let down (from lamb, ‘hang down’) to check the speed of a wagon.

अपाष्ठ
अपाष्ठ
 --This word occurs twice in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 6, 5; v. 18, 7 (s4ata1pa1s2t2ha, ‘hun3dred-barbed’). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 300; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 375. denoting the barb of an arrow.

अपिशर्वर

अपी
अपी
 --Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158, 159. finds an Api1 whose sons are described as not performing sacrifice (a-yajn5a-sa1c) and as breakers of the law of Mitra-Varun2a in the Rigveda. 2) vi. 67, 9. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., apya. and Grassmann take the expression used (apyah2 putra1h2) as referring to the sons of the waters.

अपूप
अपूप
 is the general word from the Rigveda 1) iii. 52, 7. onwards for a cake, which might be mixed with ghee (ghr2tavant), 2) Rv. x. 45, 9. or be made of rice (vri1hi), 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 3, 12, 13. or of barley (yava). 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 2, 5, 19. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 5) iii. 1, 1. there is a difference of interpretation. Max Mu7ller renders it as ‘hive,’ Bo7htlingk as ‘honeycomb,’ Little 6) Grammatical Index, s.v. as ‘cake.’

अप्नवान
अप्नवान
 appears only twice in the Rigveda 1) iv. 7, 1; viii. 91, 4. as an ancient sage, coupled with the Bhr2gus, to whose family Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 128. conjectures him to have belonged. 

अप्रतिरथ
अ-प्रति-रथ
 (‘he who has no match in fight’) is the name of an obviously invented R2s2i, to whom is ascribed by the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) viii. 10. and S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) ix. 2, 3, 1. 5. the composition of a Rigveda hymn 3) x. 103. celebrating Indra as the invincible warrior.

अप्वा
अप्वा
 --A disease affecting the stomach, 1) Av. ix. 8, 9. possibly dysentery, as suggested by Zimmer, 2) Altindisches Leben, 389. on the ground that the disease is invoked to confound the enemy. 3) Rv. x. 103, 12 = Av. iii. 2, 5 = Sa1maveda, ii. 1211 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 44. Weber 4) Indische Studien, 9, 482; 17, 184. considers that it is diarrhœa induced by fear, as often in the Epic. 5) Indische Studien, 17, 184. This view is supported by Bloomfield, 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 327. and was apparently that of Ya1ska. 7) Nirukta, ix. 33. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 86, 87.

अप्सस्
अप्सस्
 --This word usually refers to the body, meaning ‘front part.’ 1) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 308-313; 2, 245, 246. In one passage of the Rigveda, 2) i. 122, 15. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, the adjective ‘with a long front part’ (di1rgha1psas) is applied to the chariot (Ratha).

अभिक्रोशक
अभि-क्रोशक
 designates one of the victims in the Purus2amedha, meaning, perhaps, ‘herald.’ The commentator Mahi1dhara 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 20. Cf. Anukros4aka, Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 15, 1. renders it as ‘reviler’ (nindaka).

अभिजित्
अभि-जित्
 See Naks2atra.

अभिपित्व
अभि-पित्व
 See Ahan.

अभिप्रतारिन्काक्षसेनि
अभि-प्रतारिन् काक्ष-सेनि
 is mentioned in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, 1) i. 59, 1; iii. 1, 21; 2, 2. 13. the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 2) iv. 3, 5. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 3) x. 5, 7; xiv. 1, 12. 15. as engaged in discussions on philosophy. The Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a 4) iii. 156 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 61). further reports that his sons divided the property amongst themselves while he was yet alive. He was a Kuru and a prince. 

अभिप्रश्निन्
अभि-प्रश्निन्
 --This term occurs after Pras4nin, and followed by Pras4naviva1ka in the list of victims for the Purus2amedha given in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 4, 6, 1. and the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 2) xxx. 10. The commentators, Sa1yan2a and Mahi1dhara, see in it merely a reference to an inquisitive man. But there can be little doubt that the term must have had a legal reference of some sort-perhaps indicating the defendant as opposed to plaintiff and judge.

अभिश्री
अभि-श्री
 (‘admixture’).--This word 1) Rv. ix. 79, 5; 86, 27. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, i. 211. designates the milk used to mingle with the Soma juice before it was offered.

अभिषवणी
अभि-षवणी
 --Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 277. renders the expression in the Atharvaveda 2) ix. 6, 16. as a pressing instrument, but it appears to be merely an adjective, (waters) ‘used in pressing.’ 3) Cf. Whitney's Translation of Av. ix. 6, 16.

अभिषेक
अभि-षेक
 (‘besprinkling’).--The Vedic king was consecrated after his election with an elaborate ritual, which is fully described in the Taittiri1ya, 1) i. 7, 5. Pan5cavim2s4a, 2) xviii. 8 et seq. S4atapatha, 3) v. 3, 3 et seq. and Aitareya Bra1hman2as, 4) viii. 5 et seq. and for which the Mantras are given in the Sam2hita1s. 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 11; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 6; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 1-4. The consecration took place by sprinkling with water (abhis2ecani1ya1 a1pah2). 6) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 5, 10-15, Only kings could be consecrated, the people not being worthy of it (anabhis2ecani1ya1h2). 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 2, 17. The sprinkler (abhis2ektr2) is mentioned in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha. 8) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 12; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 8, 1. The Abhis2eka is an essential part of the Ra1jasu1ya, or sacrifice of royal inauguration, being the second of its component members. 9 Cf. Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 143-147; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, xxvi; Weber, U7ber den Ra1jasu1ya. 

अभीशु
अभीशु
 is a common Vedic word 1) Rv. i. 38, 12; v. 44, 4; vi. 75, 6; viii. 33, 11; Av. vi. 137, 2; viii. 8, 22; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 3, 14 (where it = ras4mayah2, ‘reins’), etc. denoting the ‘reins’ or ‘bridle’ of the chariot horses. The use of the plural is due to the fact that two or four horses, possibly five (das4a1bhi1s4u ‘tenbridled’), 2) Rv. x. 94, 7. were yoked to the car.

अभ्यग्निऐतशायन
अभ्य्-अग्नि ऐतशायन
 --This man was, according to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) vi. 33. unfortunate enough to quarrel with his father, Aitas4a. The result was that he and his progeny were called the worst of the Aurvas. In the version of the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, 2) xxx. 5. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 173. the Aitas4a1yana A1ja1neyas take the place of the Abhyagnis and the Bhr2gus of the Aurvas, the latter being probably a branch of the former family.

अभ्यावर्तिन्चायमान
अभ्या-वर्तिन् चायमान
 appears in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda, 1) vi. 27, 8. 5. and as conqueror of the Vr2ci1vants under the leader Varas4ikha. It is probable though not absolutely certain, that he is identical with the Sr2n5jaya Daivava1ta, mentioned in the same hymn 2) vi. 27, 7. as having the Turvas4as and Vr2ci1vants defeated for him by Indra. In this case he would be prince (samra1j) of the Sr2n5jayas. Daivava1ta is mentioned elsewhere 3) iv. 15, 4. as a worshipper of Agni. Abhya1vartin is also referred to as a Pa1rthava. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198 et seq. and Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105; 3, 268, n. 1. Cf. Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 604 et seq. maintained that he is thus a Parthian, the latter using the evidence of the two places mentioned in the description 6) Rv. vi. 27, 5. 6. of Daivava1ta's victories, Hariyu1pi1ya1 and Yavya1vati1, as proofs for the western position of Abhya1vartin's people in Arachosia, in Iran. But Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 133 et seq., 433; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 362. is probably right in holding that the name Pa1rthava merely means ‘a descendant of Pr2thu,’ and that its similarity to the Iranian Parthians is only on a par with the numerous other points of identity between the Indian and Iranian cultures. 

अभ्रातरः
अ-भ्रातरः
 (‘brotherless’).--The lot of girls without brothers is referred to in the Rigveda 1) i. 124, 7; iv. 5, 5. Cf. Av. i. 17, 1. as unsatisfactory--apparently they became prostitutes. The Nirukta 2) iii. 5 (abhra1tri1). Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 259; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 328. expressly forbids marriage with a brotherless maiden, probably because of the risk of her being made a putrika1 (‘adoptive daughter’) by her father--that is, any son of hers being counted as belonging to her father's, instead of to her husband's, family. See Ayogu1.

अभ्रि
अभ्रि
 (‘spade’) is a Vedic word 1) Av. iv. 7, 5. 6 (abhri-kha1te is ‘dug out with a spade,’ not ‘prepared ground’ with Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.); x. 4, 14; hiran2yayi1bhir abhribhih2, ‘with golden spades’); Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, v. 22; xi. 10; xxxvii. 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 2, 15, etc. of frequent occurrence. Various possible materials and forms are enumerated in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 2) vi. 3, 1, 30 et seq. It may be made of bamboo or of the wood of Vikan3kata or Udumbara. It may be a span or a cubit in size. It is hollow, and either one or both edges are sharp. From this it would appear that the handle was made of some wood, but the head of some metal.

अमत्र
अमत्र
 was a vessel into which the Soma, after being pressed, was poured, 1) Rv. ii. 14, 1; v. 51, 4; vi. 42, 2, etc. and out of which the libation to the god was made. 2) Rv. x. 29, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 278; Oldenberg, R2gveda Noten, 1, 61.

अमला
अमला
 --This plant 1) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 38, 6. is probably the Emblica officinalis, or Myrobalan tree; also called A1malaka, or A1malaka1. 2) The reading in Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vii. 3, 1, is va1malake, which may give a¤° or a1°.

अमाजुर्
अमा-जुर्
 is an epithet 1) Rv. ii. 17, 7; viii. 21, 15; x. 37, 3. denoting maidens ‘who grow old at home’ without finding husbands, or, as they are elsewhere called, ‘who sit with their father’ (pitr2-s2ad). A well-known example of such was Ghos2a1. 2) Rv. i. 117, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 305. 

अमावास्यशाण्दिल्यायन
अमा-वास्य शाण्दिल्यायन
 is mentioned in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) Indische Studien, iv. 373. as the teacher of Am2s4u Dha1nam2jayya.

अमित्रतपनशुष्मिणशैब्य
अमित्र-तपन शुष्मिण शैब्य
 is the name of him who killed Atyara1ti Ja1nam2tapi, according to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 23).

अमूला
अ-मूला
 (‘without root’) is the name in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 314. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 286; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 279, accepts ‘rootless (plant).’ of a plant (Methonica superba), which was used for poisoning arrows. Bloomfield, 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 457. however, renders it as ‘movable property.’

अम्बरीष
अम्बरीष
 is mentioned as a Va1rs2a1gira in the Rigveda 1) i. 100, 17. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 140. along with R2jra1s4va, Sahadeva, Sura1dhas, and Bhayama1na.

अयस्
अयस्
 --The exact metal denoted by this word when used by itself, as always in the Rigveda, 1) Rv. i. 57, 3; 163, 9; iv. 2, 17; vi. 3, 5. is uncertain. As favouring the sense of ‘bronze’ rather than that of ‘iron’ may perhaps be cited with Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 52. the fact that Agni is called ayo-dam2s2t2ra, ‘with teeth of Ayas,’ 3) Rv. i. 88, 5; x. 87, 2. with reference to the colour of his flames, and that the car-seat of Mitra and Varun2a is called ayah2-sthu1n2a, 4) Rv. v. 62, 8 (cf. 7). ‘with pillars of Ayas’ at the setting of the sun. 5) But this is not convincing, as in the same verse it is said to be ‘of golden appearance at the flush of dawn.’ Moreover, in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 6) xviii. 13. Ayas is enumerated in a list of six metals: gold (hiran2ya), Ayas, S4ya1ma, Loha, lead (si1sa), tin (trapu). Here s4ya1ma (‘swarthy’) and loha (‘red’) must mean ‘iron’ and ‘copper’ respectively; ayas would therefore seem to mean ‘bronze.’ In many passages in the Atharvaveda 7) xi. 3, 1. 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 9. and other books, the Ayas is divided into two species--the s4ya1ma (‘iron’) and the lohita (‘copper’ or ‘bronze’). In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 8) v. 4, 1, 2. a distinction is drawn between Ayas and loha1yasa, which may either be a distinction between iron and copper as understood by Eggeling, 9) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 90 or between copper and bronze as held by Schrader. 10) Prehistoric Antiquities, 189. In one passage of the Atharvaveda, 11) v. 28, 1. the sense of iron seems certain. Possibly, too, the arrow of the Rigveda, 12) vi. 75, 15. which had a tip of Ayas (yasya1 ayo mukham), was pointed with iron. Copper, however, is conceivable, and bronze quite likely. Iron is called s4ya1ma ayas or s4ya1ma alone. 13) Av. ix. 5, 4. See also Ka1rs2n2a1yasa. Copper is Loha1yasa or Lohita1yasa. The smelting (dhma1 ‘to blow’) of the metal is frequently referred to. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 14) vi. 1, 3, 5. Cf. vi. 1, 1, 13; v. 1, 2, 14; xii. 7, 1, 7; 2, 10, etc. states that if ‘well smelted’ (bahu-dhma1tam) it is like gold, referring evidently to bronze. A heater of Ayas is mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 15) xxx. 14; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 10, 1. and bowls of Ayas are also spoken of. 16) Av. viii. 10, 22; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 13.

अयस्थूण
अय-स्थूण
 --He was Gr2hapati (‘householder,’ the sacrificer at sacrificial sessions) of those whose Adhvaryu was S4aulva1yana, and taught the latter the proper mode of using certain spoons. 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 4, 2, 17 et seq.

अयास्यआङ्गिरस
अयास्य आङ्गिरस
 --This sage appears to be mentioned in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) x. 67, 1; 108, 8. Perhaps x. 92. 15 also refers to him, but not i. 62, 7; x. 138, 4. and the Anukraman2i1 ascribes to him several hymns of the Rigveda (ix. 44-46; x. 67; 68). In the Bra1hman2a tradition he was Udga1tr2 at the Ra1jasu1ya or Royal Inauguration Sacrifice, at which S4unah2s4epa was to have been slain, and his Udgi1tha (Sa1maveda chant) is referred to elsewhere. 3) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 2. 6; 8, 3. Cf. Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 2, 12. He is also referred to several times as a ritual 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 16. authority. 4) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 3, 22; xvi. 12, 4; xi. 8, 10; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 3, 8. 19. 24; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 6. In the Vam2s4as, or Genealogies of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 5) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 (in both recensions). Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 136; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 159; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 255, n.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 3, 204. he is named as the pupil of A1bhu1ti Tva1s2t2ra.

अयोगू
अयोगू
 is a word of quite doubtful meaning, found in the list of victims in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 1) xxx. 5; Taithri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 1. It may, like the late a1yogava, denote a member of a mixed caste (theoretically a descendant of a S4u1dra by a Vais4ya wife). 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Weber 3) Indische Streifen, 1, 76, n. b. In the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 18, 277, he thought it referred to dicing (ayas). Risley, Peoples of India, 250, regards the A1yogavas as a functional caste of carpenters (cf. Manu, x. 48). rendered it as ‘unchaste woman.’ 4) Altindisches Leben, 328. Zimmer thinks it denotes a brotherless maiden who is exposed to the dangers of prostitution (cf. a1yogava).

अरटु

 --A plant 1) Av. xx. 131, 17. (Colosanthes Indica) from the wood of which the axle of a chariot was sometimes made. 2) Rv. viii. 46, 27. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62, 247.

अरण्य
अरण्य
 --This term denotes the uncultivated land--not necessarily forest land--beyond the village. It is contrasted with home (ama1), 1) Rv. vi. 24, 10. and with the plough land (kr2s2i), 2) Av. ii. 4, 5. being spoken of as apart (tiras) from men. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 6, 2, 20. It is also contrasted with the Gra1ma, 4) Av. xii. 1, 56; Rv. i. 163, 11; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 45; xx. 17. and it is the place where thieves live. 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 3, 5; xiii. 2, 4, 4. The character of the forest is described in a hymn of the Rigveda 6) x. 146. to the forest spirit (Aran2ya1ni1). The dead are carried there for burial, 7) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, v. 11. and hermits live there. 8) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 5, 3. Forest fires were common. 9) Rv. i. 65, 4; 94, 10. 11; ii. 14, 2; x. 92, 1; 142, 4; Av. vii. 50, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 48, 142. 

अरत्नि
अरत्नि
 --This word, which primarily means ‘elbow,’ occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) Rv. viii. 80, 8; Av. xix. 57, 6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 3, 1, 33, etc. For Rv. viii. 80, 8, see also A1ji. onwards as denoting a measure of length (‘ell’ or ‘cubit’), the distance from the elbow to the tip of the hand. The exact length nowhere appears from the early texts.

अराजानः
अ-राजानः,
 ‘not princes,’ is a term used to describe persons in two passages of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) iii. 4, 1, 7. 8; xiii. 4, 2, 17. and in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 2) viii. 23. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 17, 199. also finds them mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 4) iii. 5, 7, where he emends ra1ja1nah2 to a-ra1ja1nah2 (see Whitney's note on the passage). Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaved2a, 333; Weber, U7ber den Ra1jasu1ya, 22 et seq. and thinks that they--Su1tas (‘charioteers’) and Gra1man2i1s (‘troop-leaders’) there referred to--were called thus because, while not themselves princes, they assisted in the consecration of princes.

अराटकी
अराटकी
 is a plant mentioned once in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 37, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 408. and apparently identical with the Ajas4r2n3gi1. Cf. also Arat2u.

अरित्र
अरित्र
 denotes the ‘oar’ by which boats were propelled. The Rigveda 1) i. 116, 5. and the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 2) xxi. 7. speak of a vessel with a hundred oars, and a boat (nau) is said to be ‘propelled by oars’ (aritra-paran2a). 3) Rv. x. 101, 2. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 2, 5, 10. In two passages of the Rigveda 4) i. 46, 8; das4a1ritra, ii. 18, 1. the term, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, denotes a part of a chariot. The rower of a boat is called aritr2. 5) Rv. ii. 42, 1; ix. 95, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 256. See Nau.

 is the full style 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 9, 2; 4, 5, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 10; iii. 6, 4. 6; 7, 4; 8, 6; 10, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvi. 10. of a teacher, who is repeatedly referred to in the later Sam2hita1s 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 5, 11; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 2, 20; xi. 4, 1, 4; 5, 3, 2. and Bra1hman2as, 3) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 5, 3 (in both recensions). and whose son was the famous Udda1laka A1run2i. He was a pupil of Upaves4a, 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 1, 2. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 146, n.^4 and a contemporary of the prince As4vapati, by whom he was instructed. Cf. A1run2a.

अरुन्धती
1. Arundhati1 is the name of a plant celebrated in several passages of the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 12, 1; v. 5, 5. 9; vi. 59, 1. 2; viii. 7, 6; xix. 38, 1. as possessing healing properties in case of wounds, as a febrifuge, and as inducing cows to give milk. The plant was a climber which attached itself to trees like the Plaks2a, As4vattha, Nyagrodha, and Parn2a. 2) Av. v. 5, 5. It was of golden colour (hiran2ya-varn2a1), and had a hairy stem (lomas4avaks2an2a1). 3) Av. v. 5, 7; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 174; Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 574. It was also called Sila1ci1, and the La1ks2a1 appears to have been a product of it. 4) Cf. Whitney's note on Av. iv. 12; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61.

अरुन्धती
2. Arundhati1, as the name of a star, is often referred to in the Su1tra literature, but only once in a late A1ran2yaka. 1) Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iii. 9, 2. 

अर्क
अर्क,
 as the name of the tree Colotropis gigantea, is perhaps found in one obscure passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 72, 1, where see Whitney's note. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

अर्गल
अर्गल
 --The word which is usual later to denote the wooden pin of a door is found in the S4a1n2kha1yana A1ran2yaka (ii. 16) in the compound argales2i1ke to denote the pin and bar of the door of a cow-pen. Cf. Is2i1ka1.

अर्गलकाहोडि
अर्गल-काहोडि
 is mentioned in the Ka1t2haka Samhita1 (xxv. 7) as a teacher. The name may, however, be Aryala, as suggested in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and as read by v. Schroeder in his edition. The Kapis2t2hala (xxxix. 5) has Ayala. See below.

अर्चन्त्
अर्चन्त्
 is possibly, as Ludwig 1) Translation of the R2igveda, 3, 133. thinks, the name of the author of a hymn of the Rigveda 2) x. 149, 5. ; but the word may be merely the ordinary participle ‘praising.’

अर्चनानस्
अर्चनानस्
 --In one passage of the Rigveda 1) v. 64, 7. the gods MitraVarun2a are besought to protect Arcana1nas. He is also invoked with S4ya1va1s4va and several other ancestors enumerated in the Atharvaveda. 2) xviii. 3, 15. He appears as father of S4ya1va1s4va in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) viii. 5, 9. The later tradition makes him play a part in the legend of his son's wedding, which Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 50 et seq. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 127; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 354. endeavours to show is known to the Rigveda.

अर्चा

अर्जुनी
अर्जुनी
 is, in the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 13. the name of the Naks2atra (‘lunar mansion’), elsewhere 2) Av. xiv. 1, 13. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 11, 2. called Phalguni1. It occurs in the marriage hymn, with Agha1 for Magha1, and, like that word, is apparently a deliberate modification. 

अर्बुद
अर्बुद
 is mentioned as Gra1vastut priest at the snake festival described in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15. He is obviously the same mythical figure as Arbuda Ka1draveya, a seer spoken of in the Aitareya 2) vi. 1. and Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2as 3) xxix. 1. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 3, 9. as a maker of Mantras.

अर्य
अर्य
 --This word is not common in the older literature, in places where the quantity of the first vowel is fixed as short, except in a mere adjectival sense. Geldner, 1) Vedische Studien, 3, 96. indeed, contends that no other sense is anywhere needed; but Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 214, 215. agree in thinking that in several passages of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 4) xiv. 30; xx. 17; xxiii. 21; xxvi. 2. Cf. also Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxviii. 5; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 19, 3. In Atharvaveda, xix. 32, 8, an analogous form occurs, as contrasted with bra1hman2a, ra1janya, and s4u1dra; but even there Whitney renders it as ‘A1ryan.’ Cf. xix. 62, 1; Rv. viii. 94, 3; Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 40, 125. the word has the same sense as A1rya, and this appears probable. Whether it is necessary to ascribe this sense to the word in the compound arya-patni1 5) Rv. vii. 6, 5; x. 43, 8. applied to the waters set free by Indra, is more doubtful. The commentator, Mahi1dhara, 6) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 30. suggests that the word means a Vais4ya, not an A1rya generally. This view is supported by the explanation in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 7) xiii. 2, 9, 8. Contrast S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xvi. 4, 4 et seq., where Arya appears to be taken in the wider sense. of one of the passages of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 8) xxiii. 30. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 212; Weber, Indische Studien, x. 6; Oldenberg, R2gvedaNoten, 1, 126, 363. But though the use of Arya to denote a Vais4ya became common later, it is not clear that it was original.

अर्यम्णःपन्था
अर्यम्णः पन्था,
 ‘Aryaman's Way,’ an expression which occurs in the Bra1hman2as, 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 6, 6; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 12, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 2. denotes, according to Weber, 2) U7ber den Ra1jasu1ya, 48, 2. ‘the milky way,’ but, according to Hillebrandt, 3) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 79, 80. ‘the ecliptic.’ 

अर्यल

 is the name of a disease mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xii. 98. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 398; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. with consumption and other ailments. It appears to designate ‘hæmorrhoids,’ as in the later medical literature.

अलज
अलज
 designates some kind of bird--one of the victims in the As4vamedha, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 4, 11, 1; 5, 20, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 18; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxi. 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 34. or Horse Sacrifice.

अलजि
अलजि
 is the name of a disease in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 8, 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 390; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The later alaji1 denotes an eye-disease--a discharge at the junction of the cornea and the sclerotica.

 --This is the reading in the text of the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 31, 2. of the name of a species of worm. Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 315. shows reason to adopt the reading Algan2d2u as the correct form of the word.

अलाबु
अलाबु
 --The bottle-gourd (Lagenaria vulgaris). Vessels made of it are referred to in the Atharvaveda. 1) viii. 10, 29. 30; xx. 132, 1. 2. Cf. ala1pu in Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 13.

अलाय्य
अलाय्य
 is a word occurring in an obscure verse of the Rigveda, 1) ix. 67, 20. and appearing to be a proper name. Hillebrandt, 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 418. however, amends the text so as to remove the name. The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that it refers to Indra. Pischel 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 701. holds that it is the name of a person whose axe was stolen, and for whom the hymn was written as a spell for the recovery of the axe.

अलिक्लव
अलिक्लव
 is a kind of carrion bird mentioned in the Atharvaveda. 1) xi. 2, 2; 9, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 88.

अलिन
अलिन
 is the name of a people mentioned once only in the Rigveda. 1) vii. 18, 7. Roth 2) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. thought that the Alinas were allies--possibly a subdivision--of the Tr2tsus. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 207. more probably thinks that they were defeated by Suda1s, together with the Pakthas, Bhala1nas, S4ivas, and Vis2a1n2ins, with whom they are mentioned, at the Parus2n2i1; and Zimmer 4) Op. cit., 431. The land is mentioned by Hiouen Thsang. suggests that they lived to the north-east of Kafiristan.

 is an aquatic plant (Blyxa octandra) frequently referred to in the Atharvaveda as well as in the later Sam2hita1s 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 1, 1; v. 4, 2, 1; 4, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 4; xxv. 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 10, 1. and Bra1hman2as. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 5, 1, 11; viii. 3, 2, 5; ix. 1, 2, 20. 22; xiii. 8, 3, 13. The Gandharvas are said to eat it. 4) Av. iv. 37, 8. Its later name is s4aivala, and it is identical with the S4i1pa1la. 1) viii. 7, 9; 37, 8-10. 5) With which it is glossed in A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, ii. 8; iv. 4. Cf.

अवत
अवत,
 a word occurring several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 55, 8; 85, 10. 11; 116, 9, 22; 130, 2; iv. 17, 16; 50, 3; viii. 49, 6; 62, 6; 72, 10, 12; x. 25, 4; 101, 5. 7. Cf. Nirukta, v. 26. denotes a well, artificially made (khan ‘to dig’) in contrast with a spring (utsa), though the latter expression is also applied to an artificial well. Such wells were covered by the makers, 2) Rv. i. 55, 8. and are described as unfailing (a-ks2ita) and full of water. 3) Rv. x. 101, 6, etc. The water was raised by a wheel (cakra) of stone, to which was fastened a strap (varatra1), with a pail (kos4a) 4) Am2satra-kos4am, Rv. x. 101, 7, is best thus rendered. For the stone wheel (as4ma-cakra) which was above (ucca1cakra), see Rv. x. 101, 7; viii. 72, 10. For the varatra1, see Rv. x. 101, 6. Perhaps ku1-cakra in Rv. x. 102, 11, is another name for the wheel, but cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. attached to it. When raised it was poured (sin5c) into buckets (a1ha1va) of wood. 5) Rv. x. 101, 6. 7. Sometimes those wells appear to have been used for irrigation purposes, the water being led off into broad channels (sa1rmi1 sus2ira1). 6) Rv. viii. 69, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 156, 157; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 14.

 is mentioned as a seer in the Rigveda, 1) v. 44. 10. as a priest in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 2) ii. 24. and as Pra1sravan2a (or Pra1s4ravan2a), son of Prasravan2a, in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a. 3) xiii. 3. A hymn of the Rigveda 4) ix. 58. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 188; 2, 315; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 62, et seq. is incorrectly ascribed to him in the Anukraman2i1.

 --‘Sheep’ are repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda, and later, often in conjunction with goats (aja). The wolf (vr2ka) was their great enemy, 1) Av. v. 8, 4; Rv. viii. 34, 3; 66, 8. and they were tended by shepherds. 2) Avi-pa1la, Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 2; avi-pa, Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 9, 1. Sheep as well as kine were captured from the enemy. 3) Rv. viii. 86, 2. The Soma sieve was made of sheep's wool, and is repeatedly referred to (avi, mes2i1, avya, avyaya). 4) Rv. ix. 109, 16; 36, 4, etc. See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 203. Considerable herds must have existed, as R2jra1s4va is said 5) Rv. i. 116, 17. to have slain one hundred rams, and in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) 6) Rv. viii. 67, 3. a hundred sheep are mentioned as a gift. The (mes2a, 7) Rv. i. 43, 6; 116, 16, etc. vr2s2n2i 8) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 7, 4, etc. ) ram was sometimes castrated (petva). 9) Rv. vii. 18, 17; Av. iv. 4, 8; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 22, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxix. 58; 59. The main use of sheep was their wool; hence the expression ‘woolly’ (u1rn2a1vati1) 10) Rv. viii. 67, 3. Cf. x. 75, 8; so ura1, x. 95, 3. is employed to designate a sheep. In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 11) xiii. 50. the ram is described as ‘woolly,’ and as ‘the skin of beasts, quadruped and biped,’ with reference to the use of its wool as clothing for men and shelter for animals. Pu1s2an is said 12) Rv. x. 26, 6. to weave raiment from the wool of sheep. Normally the sheep stayed out at pasture; in an obscure passage of the Rigveda 13) x. 106, 5. reference appears to be made to rams in stall. Gandha1ra 14) Rv. i. 126, 7. ewes were famous for their wool. Pischel 15) Vedische Studien, 2, 210. considers that the Parus2n2i1 16) Rv. iv. 22, 2; v. 52, 9. was named from its richness in sheep, parus 17) Rv. ix. 15, 6; parvan, iv. 22, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 229, 230; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 348. denoting the ‘flocks’ of wool.

अशनि
अशनि
 --Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 301. cites this word from the Rigveda 2) vi. 6, 5. Cf. 1, 121, 9. as denoting a sling stone, and compares a similar use of Adri. 3) i. 51, 3. In either case, however, the weapons are mythical, being used in descriptions of Indra's deeds. Schrader 4) Prehistoric Antiquities, 221. also cites as4an in this sense, but no Vedic passage requires this sense.

अश्मगन्धा
अश्म-गन्धा
 (‘rock-smell’) is a plant mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) xiii. 8, 1, 16, with Eggeling's note in the Sacred Books of the East, 44, 427. probably identical with the late as4vagandha1, ‘horse-smell’ (Physalis flexuosa). 

अश्व
अश्व
 is the commonest word for ‘horse’ in the Vedic literature. The horse is also called ‘the runner’ (atya), ‘the swift’ (arvant), ‘the strong,’ for pulling (va1jin), ‘the runner’ (sapti), and ‘the speeding’ (haya). The mare is termed as4va1, atya1, arvati1, vad2ava1, etc. Horses of various colour were known, dun (harita, hari), ruddy (arun2a, arus2a, pis4an3ga, rohita), dark brown (s4ya1va), white (s4veta), etc. A white horse with black ears is mentioned in the Atharvaveda as of special value. 1) Av. v. 17, 15. Horses were highly prized, 2) Rv. i. 83, 1; iv. 32, 17; v. 4, 11; viii. 78, 2, etc. and were not rare, as Roth 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 35, 686. thought, for as many as four hundred mares are mentioned in one Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’). 4) Rv. viii. 55, 3. Cf. v. 33, 8; vi. 47, 22-24; 63, 10; viii. 6, 47; 46, 22, and Hopkins, American Journal of Philology, 15, 157. They were on occasion ornamented with pearls and gold. 5) Rv. x. 68, 11. Mares were preferred for drawing chariots because of their swiftness and sureness. 6) Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 35, 712714; Vedische Studien, 1, 10, 305. Cf. ratho vadhu1ma1n, Rv. i. 126, 3; vii. 18, 22, va1jini1va1n, vii. 69, 1. They were also used for drawing carts, but were not ordinarily so employed. 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 35. No mention is made of riding in battle, but for other purposes it was not unknown. 8) The As4vins ride, Rv. v. 61, 1-3. An as4va-sa1da is referred to in Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 13; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 7, 1; and riding is meant in Rv. i. 162, 17; 163, 9. Av. xi. 10, 24. is doubtful. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 262; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 221. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 230, denies the use; but see p. 295, where it is admitted for ordinary purposes. Horses were often kept in stalls, 9) Cf. the epithet of richness, ‘filling the stalls with horses’ (as4va-pastya), in Rv. ix. 86, 41, and see Av. vi. 77, 1; xix. 55, 1. and fed there. 10) Av. loc. cit. But they were also allowed to go out to grass, 11) Zimmer, op. cit., 232, denies this, but it is the natural sense of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 41. and were then hobbled. 12) The expression for this is pad2bi1s4a, Rv. i. 162, 14. 16; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 2, 13; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 1, 12; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, ix. 7. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 234-236. They were watered to cool them after racing. 13) Rv. ii. 13, 5; 34, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 11, 6; Pischel, op. cit., 1, 189, 190. Their attendants are frequently referred to (as4va-pa1la, 14) S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xvi. 4, 5. as4va-pa, 15) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 9, 1. as4va-pati). 16) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 24; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13. Stallions were frequently castrated (vadhri). 17) Rv. viii. 46, 30. Besides reins (ras4mayah2), reference is made to halters (as4va1bhidha1ni1), 18) Av. iv. 36, 10; v. 14, 6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 35; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 3, 1, 26; xiii. 1, 2, 1. and whips (as4va1jani). 19) Rv. v. 62, 7; vi. 75, 13; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxix. 50. See also Ratha. Horses from the Indus were of special value, 20) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 2, 13; Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, ix. 7; va1jini1vati1 as epithet of Sindhu, Rv. x. 75, 8, of Sarasvati1, i. 3, 10; ii. 41, 18; vi. 61, 3. 4; vii. 96, 3; Pischel, op. cit., i. 10. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 230-232. as also horses from the Sarasvati1.

अश्वतर
अश्व-तर, अश्व-तरी
 are respectively the masculine and feminine name of ‘mule.’ These animals are mentioned frequently from the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 4, 8; viii. 8, 22; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 47; iv. 9; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 4, 1, 10, etc.; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 4. onwards. They were known not to be fruitful, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 1, 2. 3. Cf. Adbhuta Bra1hman2a in Indische Studien, 1, 40. and were probably considered inferior to horses, 3) As were asses, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 2, 2; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 4, 4, 7. but a mule-car was quite common. 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 9; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 2, 1 (in both passages as4vatari1-ratha). Cf. Oertel, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 175.

अश्वत्थ
1. As4va-ttha (‘horse-stand’) is one of India's greatest trees, the Ficus religiosa, later called pippala 1) The word pippala as a neuter occurs once in the Rv. (i. 164, 20) designating the berry of the Peepal-tree. (now Peepal). Vessels made of the wood of the As4vattha are mentioned in the Rigveda, 2) i. 135, 8; x. 97, 5. and the tree itself is constantly referred to later. 3) Atharvaveda, iii. 6, 1; iv. 37, 4, etc. Its hard wood formed the upper of the two pieces of wood used for kindling fire, the lower being of S4ami1. 4) Av. vi. 11, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 1, 13. It planted its roots in shoots of other trees, especially the Khadira, and destroyed them; 5) Av. iii. 6. hence it is called ‘the destroyer’ (vaiba1dha). Its berries are referred to as sweet, and as eaten by birds. 6) Rv. i. 164, 20. 22. The gods are said to sit under it in the third heaven. 7) Av. v. 4, 3. Cf. Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 5, 3; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 3. It and Nyagrodha are styled the ‘crested ones’ (s4ikhan2d2in). 8) Av. iv. 37, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 57, 58.

अश्वत्थ
2. As4va-ttha. --This prince is celebrated in a Da1nastuti 1) Rv. vi. 47, 24. as having given gifts to Pa1yu. He is identified with Divoda1sa by Griffith, 2) Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 611. The name is spelt As4vatha in the text, but that is merely the usual shortened spelling of the group tth. but it is impossible to be certain of this identification.

अश्वदावन्
अश्व-दावन्
 --Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 274. finds a prince of this name in a passage of the Rigveda, 2) v. 18, 3. where a gift of fifty horses is mentioned, but the word appears to be an epithet of Indra (‘bestower of horses’).

अश्वपति
अश्व-पति
 (‘lord of horses’) is a name of a prince of the Kekayas, who instructed Pra1ci1nas4a1la and other Brahmins. 1) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 11, 4; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 1, 2.

अष्टकर्णी
अष्ट-कर्णी
 is an expression which occurs in one passage of the R2igveda, 1) x. 62, 7. and which Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. was at first inclined to interpret as a proper name. There can, however, be no doubt that it means a cow, not a man, as suggested by Grassmann. The exact reason why a cow should be so described is uncertain. Roth 3) Cf. Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. was later inclined to see in it the sense ‘having pierced ears,’ similar epithets being at a later period known to Pa1n2ini 4) vi. 3, 115. (bhinna-karn2a, chinna-karn2a). Grassmann's more obvious rendering, ‘having the sign for (the number) 8 marked on the ear,’ is supported by the similar epithets, ‘having the mark of a lute on the ear’ (karkari-karn2yah2), ‘having the mark of a sickle on the ear’ (da1tra-karn2yah2), ‘having the mark of a stake on the ear’ (sthu1n2a1karn2yah2), ‘having the ears bored’ (chidra-karn2yah2), and vis2tyakarn2yah2, given in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1. 5) iv. 2, 9. The simple meaning, ‘with marked ears,’ is, however, supported by the same passage of the Maitra1yan2i1, where the verb aks2 occurs in the sense ‘to mark.’ In the Atharvaveda the mark used is the Mithuna, no doubt as a magical device to secure fertility. The marking of ears was apparently a regular practice. It is twice referred to in the Atharvaveda. 6) vi. 141, 1. 2; xii. 4, 6. The mark is termed laks2man, 7) Av. vi. 141, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, loc. cit. and was made with a copper-knife 8) Av., loc. cit. (lohita). The Maitrayan2i1 Sam2hita1 9) Loc. cit. Cf.

It appears to be based on a misreading of the Rigveda, 2) x. 60, 2. 5; Av. vi. 79, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 499; Max Mu7ller, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1866, 426-465; Bo7htlingk's Dictionary, s.v.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 48, n. 1. where asama1ti is merely an adjective. The later story is that the king was induced to abandon his family priests by two Asuras, Kira1ta and A1kuli, who by their magic compassed the death of Subandhu, one of the brother priests, and that the others revived him by the use of the hymns (Rigveda, x. 57-60).

 ‘the science of the Asuras,’ the term used in the S4a1n3kha1yana and A1s4vala1yana 1) x. 7. S4rauta Su1tras as the equivalent of the term ma1ya1 employed in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) xiii. 4, 3, 11. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 61, 2. 21. clearly means ‘magic,’ as it is rendered by Professor Eggeling. 3) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 368.

अस्तृ
अस्तृ,
 ‘shooter,’ is a term frequently used in the Rigveda 1) i. 8, 4; 64, 10; ii. 42, 2, etc. and Atharvaveda 2) vi. 93, 1. 2; xi. 2, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296. for the archer who fought from the chariot.

अहन्
अहन्,
 ‘day.’ Like other peoples, the Indians used night as a general expression of time as well as day, but by no means predominantly. 1) Rv. iv. 16, 19; viii. 26, 3; i. 70, 4. Cf. Av. x. 7, 42. Night is also termed the dark (kr2s2n2a), as opposed to the light (arjuna), day. 2) Rv. vi. 9. 1. Aho-ra1tra 3) Rv. x. 190, 2; Av. xiii. 3, 8, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 41, etc. is a regular term for ‘day and night’ combined. The day itself is variously divided. In the Atharvaveda 4) ix. 6, 45. a division into ‘the rising sun’ (udyan su1ryah2), ‘the coming together of the cows’ (sam2-gava), ‘midday’ (madhyam2-dina), ‘afternoon’ (apara1hn2a), and ‘sunset’ (astam2-yan) is found. In the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 5) i. 5, 3, 1; 4, 9, 2. the same series appears with ‘early’ (pra1tar) and ‘evening’ (sa1ya1hna) substituted for the first and last members, while a shorter list gives pra1tar, sam2gava, sa1yam. In the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 6) iv. 2, 11. there is the series ‘dawn’ (us2as), sam2gava, madhyam2dina, and apara1hn2a. The morning is also, according to Zimmer, called api-s4arvara, 7) Rv. iii. 9, 7; cf. Oldenberg, R2gvedaNoten, 1, 230. as the time when the dark is just past. It is named svasara, 8) Rv. ii. 34, 8; ix. 94, 2. as the time when the cows are feeding, before the first milking at the sam2gava, or when the birds are awakening. 9) Rv. ii. 19, 2; 34, 5. It is also called pra-pitva, 10) Rv. vii. 41, 4; viii. 1, 29. Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 127 et seq., interprets paritakmya1ya1m (Rv. i. 116, 15) similarly. according to Zimmer. 11) Altindisches Leben. 362. But Geldner 12) Vedische Studien, 2, 155-179. points out that that term refers to the late midday, which also is called api-s4arvara, as bordering on the coming night, being the time when day is hastening to its close, as in a race. From another point of view, evening is called abhi-pitva, 13) Rv. i. 126, 3; iv. 34, 5. the time when all come to rest. Or again, morning and evening are denoted as the dawning of the sun (udita1 su1ryasya), or its setting (ni-mruc). The midday is regularly madhyam ahna1m, 14) Rv. vii. 41, 4. madhye, 15) Rv. viii. 27, 20. or madhyam2dina. Sam2gava 16) Cf. Rv. v. 76, 3 (sam2gave, pra1tar ahno, madhyam2dine); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 1, 3; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 12, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 18, 14; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 112, 113. Zimmer, op. cit., 362, places it too early--before the cows are driven out. is the forenoon, between the early morning (pra1tar) and midday (madhyam2dina). The divisions of time less than the day are seldom precisely given. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 17) xii. 3, 2, 5. Cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 1, 1 et seq. however, a day and night make up 30 muhu1rtas; 1 muhu1rta = 15 ks2ipra; 1 ks2ipra = 15 etarhi; 1 etarhi = 15 ida1ni; 1 ida1ni = 15 breathings; 1 breathing = 1 spiration; 1 spiration = 1 twinkling (nimes2a), etc. In the Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 18) vii. 20. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xiv. 78 et seq.; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 92-95. the series is dhvam2sayo, nimes2a1h2, ka1s2t2ha1h2, kala1h2, ks2ana1, muhu1rta1, ahora1tra1h2. A thirtyfold division of day as well as of night is seen in one passage of the Rigveda 19) Rv. i. 123, 8. by Zimmer, who compares the Babylonian sixtyfold division of the day and night. But the expression used-thirty Yojanas--is too vague and obscure--Bergaigne 20) Religion Ve4dique. 3, 283 et seq. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. kratu. refers it to the firmament--to build any theory upon with safety. The longer divisions of time are regularly ‘half month’ (ardha-ma1sa), ‘month’ (ma1sa), ‘season’ (r2tu), and ‘year’ (sam2vatsara), which often 21) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 15; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 12, 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 28; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, vii. 20; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. iii. 8, 9, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 361-363. occur in this sequence after ahora1tra1n2i (‘days and nights’).

अहल्यामैत्रेयी
अहल्या मैत्रेयी
 is practically a mythical name, the existence of the lady whose story is alluded to in several Bra1hman2as 1) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 18; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 79; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, i. 1. being derived from the epithet of Indra, ‘lover of Ahalya1’ (ahalya1yai ja1ra).

 --This word occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) vii. 104, 7, etc. The word sarpa, which is usual in the Atharvaveda, occurs only once (x. 16, 6) in the Rv. onwards to denote ‘snake.’ Reference is several times 2) Rv. ix. 86, 44; Av. i. 27; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 2, 6, 13; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 4, 10; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 9. ii. 139; Ka1t2haka Upanis2ad, ii. 6; 17. made to its casting its slough. Mention is also made of the serpent's peculiar movement, 3) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 1, 4. which earns for it the designation 4) Av. iv. 3, 2. of ‘the toothed rope’ (datvati1 rajjuh2). The poisonous character of its bite is spoken of, 5) Rv. vii. 104. 7; Av. x. 4, 4 et seq.; 6, 56. as well as the torpidity of the reptile in winter, when it creeps into the earth. 6) Av. xii. 1, 46. The cast skin is used as an amulet against highwaymen. 7) Av. i. 27. Mention is made of a mythical horse, Paidva, which the As4vins gave to Pedu as a protection against snakes, 8) Rv. i. 117-119 and which is invoked as a destroyer of serpents. 9) Av. x. 4, 6. 10. The ichneumon (nakula) is regarded as their deadly enemy, and as immune against their poison through the use of a healing plant, 10) Av. vi. 139, 5; viii. 7, 23. while men kill them with sticks 11) Av. x. 4, 9. or strike off their heads. 12) Av. vi. 67, 2. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94, 95. Many species of snakes are mentioned: see Agha1s4va, Ajagara, Asita, Kan3kaparvan, Karikrata, Kalma1s2agri1va, Kasarn2i1la, Kumbhi1nasa, Tiras4cara1ji, Taima1ta, Darvi, Das4onasi, Pus2karasa1da, Pr2da1ku, Lohita1hi, S4arkot2a, S4vitra, Sarpa.

 --The exact sense of this word is uncertain. Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 84, 85, followed by Bloomfield. Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 142. renders it ‘mole,’ while Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., followed by Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 317, 318. prefers ‘mouse’ or ‘rat.’ It is frequently mentioned in the later Sam2hita1s, 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14. 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 57; xxiv. 26; 28; Av. vi. 50, 1. and is known to the Rigveda, 4) ix. 67, 30. where, however, the word is regarded by Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 246; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 701. as having acquired the secondary sense of ‘thief.’ This is denied by Hillebrandt. 6) Zeitschrift, 48, 418; Vedainterpretation, 7.

The series of stories 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. xiii. 4, 3, 2. 15. used at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) during the year while the sacrificial horse is allowed to wander at its will is called the ‘cyclic’ (pari-plavam).

 is constantly used in the Rigveda 1) v. 37, 7; vi. 24, 6, etc. and the later literature to express the sense of ‘a race,’ and only seldom denotes ‘a battle.’ Horse-racing was one of the favourite amusements of the Vedic Indian, 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 291; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 120; 2. 1 seq. the other being dicing (Aks2a). The racecourse, called Ka1s2t2ha1 3) Rv. viii. 80, 8; Av. ii. 14, 6. or A1ji 4) Rv. iv. 24, 8; Av. xiii. 2, 4. itself, appears from the Atharvaveda 5) ii. 14, 6; xiii. 2, 4. to have been a quasi-circular one to a mark (ka1rs2man 6) Rv. ix. 36, 1; 74, 8. ) and back again. In the Rigveda the course is described as broad (urvi1) and the distance as measured out (apa1vr2kta1 aratnayah2). 7) The sense is doubtful in Rv. viii. 80, 8. Zimmer suggests that it may mean ‘the course is straight,’ without twistings, for which idea cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 160, quoting the comparison of the courser's race with a bowstring (Rv. iii. 53, 24). It is also rendered ‘the barriers are removed.’ Prizes (dhana) were offered (dha1), 8) Rv. i. 81, 3; 116, 15; vi. 45, 1 et seq.; viii. 80, 8; ix. 53, 2; 109, 10. According to Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 120, n. 2, dhana is from dhan, ‘start.’ Cf. Pischel, ibid., 171. Cf. dhanasa1, Rv. i. 112, 7. 10; ii. 10, 6; viii. 3, 15, etc. and eagerly competed for. Other words for victory and the prize are ka1ra 9) Rv. v. 29, 8; ix. 14, 1. and bhara; 10) Rv. v. 29, 8; ix. 16, 5, etc. and to ‘run a race’ is described by the expressions a1jim aj, i, dha1v, sr2. 11) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 25; iv. 27; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 3, 4; v. 1, 1, 3; 4, 1; vi. 1, 2, 12; vii. 1, 2, 1, etc. The person who instituted a race is referred to as a1ji-sr2t, 12) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 5, 10. 28; xi. 1, 2, 13. and Indra is called a1ji-kr2t 13) Rv. viii. 53, 6. (‘race-maker’), and a1ji-pati 14) Ibid., 14. (‘lord of the race’). The swift steeds (va1jin, atya) used for the races were often washed and adorned. 15) Rv. ii. 34, 3; ix. 109, 10; x. 68, 11. According to Pischel 16) Vedische Studien, 1, 171-173. Cf. Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 127 et seq. the name of one swift mare is preserved--viz., Vis4pala1, 17) Rv. i. 116, 15. Pischel finds here a race in honour of Vivasvant, but his equation of Khela and Vivasvant is denied even by Sieg, who accepts his theory of Vis4pala1. whose broken leg was replaced by the As4vins in a race; but the interpretation is very doubtful. Geldner 18) Vedische Studien, 2, 1 et seq. has also found a comic picture of a horse-chariot race in the Mudgala hymn in the Rigveda, but Bloomfield 19) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 541 et seq. Von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus im Rigveda, 346 et seq., follows Geldner. Cf. Winternitz. Vienna Oriental Journal, 23, 137. has shown that that interpretation is unsound. Pischel 20) Vedische Studien, 1, 172. also seeks to show that races were run in honour of gods, but the evidence for the theory is inadequate. 21) Sieg, op. cit., 128. A formal race, however, is a feature of the ritual of the Ra1jasu1ya or royal consecration. 22) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 15; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 19 et seq.; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 2; 3.

See Keith's edition, pp. 266, 267, and Va1ni1. appears to be best taken with Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 247. as denoting the part of the axle of the chariot which is inserted into the nave of the wheel. Sa1yan2a renders it as lynch-pin, and this sense is accepted by Leumann, 5) Etymologisches Wo7rterbuch, 30. being apparently also found in the Nirukta. 6) vi. 32.

आनूक
आनूक
 --Geldner 1) Vedische Studien, 3, 94. thinks that in its solitary occurrence in the Rigveda 2) v. 33, 9. this word means an ornament. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary. s.v. takes it adverbially, and so do Ludwig and Oldenberg.

आपया
आपया
 is the name of a river mentioned once only in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 23, 4. when it occurs between the Dr2s2advati1 and the Sarasvati1. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. But cf. ibid., 4, 304. was inclined to identify it with the A1paga1 as a name for the Ganges, but Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 18. correctly places it near the Sarasvati1, either as the small tributary which flows past Tha1nesar or the modern Indramati1 farther west, while Pischel 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 218. assigns it to Kuruks2etra, of which the A1paya1 is mentioned as a famous river in the Maha1bha1rata. 5) Maha1bha1rata, iii. 83, 68. 

आबयु
आबयु
 is apparently the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda; 1) vi. 16, 1. the mustard plant 2) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 465, following the indication of the use of the hymn in the Kaus4ika Su1tra. may have been meant, but the sense is quite uncertain. 3) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292; Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 72.

आभिप्रतारिण
आभि-प्रतारिण
 --Patronymic of Vr2ddhadyumna.

आभूतित्वाष्ट्र
आ भूति त्वाष्ट्र
 is mentioned in two Vam2s4as, or Genealogies, of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 (in both recensions). as a pupil of Vis4varu1pa Tva1s2t2ra, both teachers being no doubt equally mythical.

आमलक
आमलक
 (neuter), a common word later, is found in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (vii. 3, 1), denoting the Myrobalan fruit. Cf. Amala1.

आमिक्षा
आमिक्षा
 designates a mess of clotted curds. It is not known to the Rigveda, but occurs in all the later Sam2hita1s, 1) Av. x. 9, 13; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 5, 4; iii. 3, 9, 2; vi. 2, 5, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 21; 23, etc. Bra1hman2as, 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 1, 7. 9; iii. 3, 3, 2, etc.; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 8, 8; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 438 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 99, 101); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 8, 5, etc. etc., and is associated with the Vais4ya in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 3) Loc. cit. Cf. Ma1nava Srauta Su1tra, ii. 2, 40.

आम्ब
आम्ब
 denotes in the Taittiri1ya 1) i. 8, 10, 1. and Ka1t2haka 2) xv. 5. Sam2hita1s a grain, called Na1mba in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) v. 3, 3, 8.

आम्बष्ठ्य
आम्बष्ठ्य
 is mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 21) as a king, whose priest for the Ra1jasu1ya, or royal inauguration, was Na1rada. Presumably the name is local, meaning ‘King of the Ambas2t2has,’ as interpreted in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Later the term Ambas2t2ha denotes ‘a man of mingled Bra1hman2a and Vais4ya parentage by father and mother’ respectively.

आयतन
आ-यतन
 --The general sense of ‘abode’ or ‘home’ appears to be limited in one passage of the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (vii. 24, 2) to the sense of ‘holy place,’ ‘sanctuary,’ which is found in the epic.

आयवस
आयवस
 is mentioned apparently as a king in a corrupt and unintelligible verse of the Rigveda. 1) i. 122, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 206; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

आयु
आयु
 appears in the Rigveda 1) i. 53, 10; ii. 14, 7; vi. 18, 3; viii. 53, 2; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 1, 60. with Kutsa and Atithigva as having been defeated, with Indra's aid, by Tu1rvaya1n2a, who is believed by Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 71-75. to have been King of the Pakthas. Possibly he is elsewhere 3) Rv. x. 49, 5; but the word is possibly not a proper name. referred to as victorious, by Indra's aid, over Ves4a. Elsewhere he is quite mythical. 4) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 100, 135, 140.

आयुत

आयुध
आ-युध,
 ‘weapon,’ in its widest sense covers the whole of a Ks2atriya's warlike equipment, which in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 19, 2. is summed up as horse-chariot (as4va-ratha), bow and arrows (is2u-dhanva), and corselet (kavaca). As the bow and arrow (is2u, dhanvan) were essential as the main weapons of the Vedic fighter, they are probably meant when A1yudha is used specifically of weapons, as often from the Rigveda 2) i. 39, 2; 61. 13; 92, 1; ii. 30, 9. etc.; Av. vi. 133, 2, etc. onwards. The battle hymn in the Rigveda 3) vi. 75. confirms this view, as it presents to us the warrior armed with bow and arrow on his chariot, and clad in armour (Varman), with a guard (Hastaghna) on the left arm to avoid the friction of the bow-string. The corselet was not a single solid piece of metal, but consisted of many pieces fitted together (syu1ta); 4) Rv. i. 31, 15. it may have been made either of metal plates or, as is more likely, of some stiff material plated with metal. In addition the warrior wore a helmet (S4ipra1). There is no trace of the use of a shield, nor is there any clear record of the employment of greaves or other guard for the feet. 5) Grassmann saw greaves in vat2u1rin2a1 pada1 in Rv. i. 133, 2, but this is most improbable. Skill in the use of weapons is referred to in the Rigveda. 6) i. 92, 1. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 183; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 295. It is doubtful whether sling stones (Adri, As4ani) were in ordinary use. The hook (an3kus4a) 7) Rv. viii. 17, 10; x. 44, 9; 134, 6; Av. vi. 83, 3. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts. 5, 87. also is merely a divine weapon, and the axe (svadhiti, 8) Rv. v. 32, 10; ix. 67, 30; x. 43, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 298301; Muir, Sanskrit Texts. 5, 469-472; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 281 et seq. va1s4i1, paras4u) does not occur in mortal combats. For the use of the spear see R2s2t2i, Rambhin2i1, S4akti, S4aru; of the sword, Asi, Kr2ti. Neither weapon can be considered ordinary in warfare, nor was the club (Vajra) used. For the modes of warfare see Sam2gra1ma.

आयोगव
आयोगव।--मरुत्त आवि-क्षित,
 the A1yogava king, is mentioned as a sacrificer in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) xiii. 5. 4, 6. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xvi. 9, 14-16. where also a Ga1tha1 (‘stanza’) celebrating his sacrifice is cited. Cf. Ayogu1.

आरङ्गर
आरङ्गर
 is one of the names of the bee found in the Rigveda. 1) x. 106, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97. Other names are Sarah and Bhr2n3ga1.

आरा
आरा,
 a word later 1) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 365. n. 1. known as an ‘awl’ or ‘gimlet,’ occurs in the Rigveda 2) vi. 53. 8. only to designate a weapon of Pu1s2an, with whose pastoral character its later use for piercing leather is consistent. Cf. Va1s4i1.

आराढि
आराढि
 --Patronymic of Sauja1ta. Cf. Ara1d2a. 

आरुणऔपवेशि
आरुण औप-वेशि
 --So the manuscripts let us read the former word in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, but this is doubtless an error for Arun2a.

आरुणि
आरुणि
 is the patronymic normally referring to Udda1laka, son of Arun2a Aupaves4i. Udda1laka is probably also meant by A1run2i Yas4asvin, who occurs as a teacher of the Subrahman2ya1 (a kind of recitation) in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a. 1) ii. 80. A1run2is are referred to both in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 2) ii. 5, 1. Cf. Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 204. and in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 3) xiii. 12. as well as in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka. 4) ii. 4. 1.

आरुणेय
आरुणेय
 --An epithet of S4vetaketu, indicating his descent from Udda1laka A1run2i and Arun2a Aupaves4i. It is apparently confined to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) x. 3, 4, 1; xi. 2, 7, 12; 5, 4, 18; 6, 2, 1; xii. 2, 1, 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 2, 1. and Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 2) v. 3, 1; vi. 1, 1. in which S4vetaketu plays a great part.

आर्क्ष

 --Patronymic of S4rutarvan and of A1s4vamedha.

आर्जीक
आर्जीक
 1) Singular: Rv. viii. 7, 29; ix. 113, 2. Plural: ix. 65, 23. and A1rji1ki1ya 2) Rv. viii. 64, 11. (masc.), A1rji1ki1ya1 3) Rv. x. 75, 5. (fem.).--The two masculine forms probably denote the people or land, while the feminine word designates the river of the land. Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 126-137. locates the country in or near Kas4mir, as Arrian 5) Anabasis, v. 29, 4. mentions Arsaces, brother of Abhisares, who presumably took his name from his people, and Abhisa1ra bordered on Kas4mir. Pischel 6) Vedische Studien, 2, 209, 217. accepts A1rji1ka as designating a country, which he, however, thinks cannot be identified. But neither Roth 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary. nor Zimmer 8) Altindisches Leben. 12-14. recognizes the word as a proper name. On the other hand, all authorities agree in regarding A1rji1ki1ya1 as the name of a river. Roth 9) Op. cit., s.v. sus2oma1. does so in one passage 10) Rv. x. 75, 5. only, elsewhere seeing references to Soma vessels; but it seems necessary to treat the word alike in all passages containing it. Zimmer does not locate the river, and Pischel denies the possibility of its identification. Hillebrandt thinks it may have been the Upper Indus, or the Vitasta1 (the Jhelum), or some other stream. Grassmann follows Ya1ska 11) Nirukta, ix. 26. in identifying it with the the Vipa1s4 (Bea7s), but this is rendered improbable by the position of the name in the hymn in praise of rivers (nadi1stuti). 12) Rv. x. 75. Brunnhofer 13) Iran und Turan, 52. Cf. Max Mu1ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 398; 399. identifies it with the Arghesan, a tributary of the Arghanab.

आर्जुनेय
आर्जुनेय
 --In the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 23; iv. 26, 1; vii. 19, 2; viii. 1, 11. this name occurs as the patronymic of Kautsa.

आर्तभागीपुत्र
आर्तभागी-पुत्र
 is mentioned as a pupil of S4aun3gi1-putra in a Vam2s4a or Genealogy in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) vi. 5, 2 (also in the Ma1dhyandina version). A1rtabha1ga is a patronymic of Jaratka1rava in the same Upanis2ad. 2) iii. 2, 1, 13.

आर्तव
आर्तव
 --This expression denotes a portion of the year consisting of more seasons than one. But it does not bear the exact sense of ‘half-year,’ as suggested by Zimmer. 1) Altindisches Leben. 374. This is shown by the fact that it occurs regularly in the plural, not in the dual. In the Atharvaveda it occurs between seasons and years (ha1yana), 2) iii. 10, 9. but also in the combinations, ‘seasons, A1rtavas, months, years,; 3) iii. 10, 10. ‘half-months, months, A1rtavas, seasons’; 4) xi. 7, 20. Cf. xv. 6, 6; 17, 6. ‘seasons, A1rtavas, months, half-months, days and nights, day’; 5) xvi. 8, 18. and in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 ‘months, seasons, A1rtavas, the year,’ 6) xxii. 28. or simply with the seasons. 7) Av. v. 28, 2. 13; x. 6, 18; 7, 5; xi. 3, 17; 6, 17; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 2, 6, 1, 3. Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i, 3. cited in this sense in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, is not so to be understood, as the word there is merely adjectival.

आर्त्नी
आर्त्नी
 denotes the end of the bow to which the bow-string (jya1) was attached. 1) Rv. vi. 75, 4; Av. i. 1, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 11; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 9, etc. The string was not normally kept fastened to both ends of the bow, but when an arrow was to be shot it was strung taut. 2) Rv. x. 166, 3. Cf. Av. vi. 42, 1. On the other hand, the legend of the death of Vis2n2u, told in the later Sam2hita1s 3) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 5. 9. and Bra1hman2as, 4) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vii. 5. 6; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 1, 7 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 297, 298; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 270. expressly contemplates his leaning on his strung bow, which cleaves his head by the sudden springing apart of the two ends when the bow-string is gnawed through.

आर्य
आर्य
 is the normal designation in the Vedic literature from the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 51, 8; 130, 8; 156, 5, etc. onwards of an A1ryan, a member of the three upper classes, Bra1hman2a, Ks2atriya, or Vais4ya, as the formal division is given in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 2) iv. 1, 6 (Ka1n2va recension). The A1rya stands in opposition to the Da1sa, 3) Rv. i. 51, 8. 9; 103, 3; vi. 20, 10; 25, 2, 3, etc. (opposed to Da1sa); Av. iv. 20, 4. 8; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 30, etc. (opposed to Su1dra). but also to the S4u1dra. Sometimes 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 205, 215, finds this use--understanding A1rya as meant--in Atharvaveda, xix. 32, 8, and 62, 1, as well as in passages where S4u1dra1ryau is found. Lanman, in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 948, 1003, quotes his view with approval; but Whitney's version leaves no doubt that he read and understood the text as A1rya, the A1ryan, not the Vais4ya. For Whitney's view, Av. iv. 20, 4. 8 may be cited; and so Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., takes the passages. In Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 10, 8, S4u1dra1ryau must mean Su1dra and Vais4ya; but the Padapa1t2ha takes it as Arya, and so does Zimmer. the expression is restricted to the Vais4ya caste, the Bra1hman2a and the Ks2atriya receiving special designations; but this use is not common, and it is often uncertain also whether Arya is not meant. The phrase S4u1dra1ryau 5) See Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 9, 3, with Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiii. 3, 7. 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 17; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 6, 7; La1t2ya1yana Su1tra, iv. 2, 5; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvii. 6, 2; Anupada Su1tra, vii. 10. is especially ambiguous, but appears to have denoted originally the S4u1dra and the A1ryan, for in the Maha1vrata ceremony the fight between a S4u1dra and an A1rya is represented in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a as one between a Bra1hman2a and a S4u1dra, though the Su1tra treats it as a fight between a Vais4ya and a S4u1dra. The word A1rya (fem. A1rya1 or A1ri1) also occurs frequently used as an adjective to describe the A1ryan classes (vis4ah2), 6) Rv. i. 77, 3; 96, 31; x. 11, 4; 43, 4, etc. or name (na1man), 7) Rv. x; 49, 3. or caste (varn2a), 8) Rv. iii. 34, 9. Cf. Varn2a. or dwellings (dha1man); 9) Rv. ix. 63, 14. or again reference is made to the A1ryan supremacy (vrata) 10) Rv. x. 65, 11. So Agni and Indra are styled A1ryan, as supporters of the A1ryan people (Rv. vi. 60, 6). being extended over the land. A1ryan foes (vr2tra) 11) Rv. vi. 33, 3; vii. 83, 1; x. 69, 6. are referred to beside Da1sa foes, and there are many 12) Rv. i. 102, 5; iii. 32, 14; vi. 22, 10; 25, 2. 3; viii. 2, 4. 27; x. 38, 3; 83, 1; 102, 3, etc. references to war of A1ryan versus A1ryan, as well as to war of A1ryan against Da1sa. From this it can be fairly deduced that even by the time of the Rigveda the A1ryan communities had advanced far beyond the stage of simple conquest of the aborigines. In the later Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as the wars alluded to seem mainly A1ryan wars, no doubt in consequence of the fusion of A1rya and Da1sa into one community. Weber 13) Indische Studien, 17, 288. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. kr2s2t2i, and Pan5ca Jana1sah2. considers that the five peoples known to the Rigveda were the A1ryans and the four peoples of the quarters (dis4) of the earth, but this is doubtful. A1ryan speech (va1c) 14) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 5; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 9. Cf. Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 196, 255; and Va1c. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 207 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 214 et seq. is specially referred to in the Aitareya and S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yakas.

आल
आल
 appears to mean ‘weed’ in the Atharvaveda, 1) Av. vi. 16, 3. But Whitney takes the word as a verb, comparing v. 22, 6. and to form part of three other words, 2) Av. vi. 16, 4. denoting, according to Sa1yan2a, grass-creepers (sasya-valli1)--viz., Alasa1la1, Silan5ja1la1, 3) Sa1yan2a reads S4ala1n5ja1la1, and the manuscripts of the Kaus4ika Su1tra (vi. 16), have S4ila1n5ja1la1. But cf. Sila1ci1. and Ni1la1galasa1la. Whitney, 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292, 293. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 466. however, does not think that the words can be given any determinate sense.

आलम्बायनीपुत्र
आलम्बायनी-पुत्र
 is mentioned in a Vam2s4a or Genealogy of the Ka1n2va recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 5, 2) as a pupil of A1lambi1-putra. In the Ma1dhyandina recension (vi. 4, 32) the relation is reversed, for there he is teacher of A1lambi1-putra and pupil of Ja1yanti1-putra.

आलम्बीपुत्र
आलम्बी-पुत्र
 is a pupil of Ja1yanti1-putra according to a Vam2s4a in the Ka1n2va recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 5, 2), but of A1lamba1yani1-putra according to the Ma1dhyandina (vi. 4, 32).

आलिगी
आलिगी
 is the name of a kind of serpent in the Atharvaveda (v. 13, 7). Cf. Viligi1.

आवसथ
आ-वसथ
 (‘dwelling’).--The precise sense 1) Av. ix. 6, 5 (a hymn in praise of entertaining Bra1hman2as); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 10, 6; iii. 7, 4, 6; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 4, 4, 6 (where Eggeling renders the word as if meaning ‘house’ merely); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 1, etc. Details are given in the Su1tras--e.g., A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, v. 9, 3; Dharma Su1tra, ii. 9, 25, 4. of this term appears to be a place for the reception of guests, especially Bra1hman2as and others on the occasion of feasts and sacrifices (somewhat like the modern meaning of Dharma-s4a1la1 as a resthouse for pilgrims), a use derived from the more general sense of ‘abode.’ 2) E.g., Aitareya Upanis2ad, iii. 12. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 120, n. 1. 

आविक
आविक
 (‘coming from the sheep,’ avi) is a term for ‘wool,’ which occurs first in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (ii. 3, 6). Cf. Avi.

अविक्षित
अवि-क्षित
 --Patronymic of Marutta, 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 21; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 6. the A1yogava.

आशरीक
आ-शरीक
 appears to denote a disease in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) xix. 34, 10. celebrating the powers of the Jan3gida plant. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 65, 391. thinks that it merely denotes the pain in the limbs accompanying fever. Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 953. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 673. suggests taking the word as merely an epithet.

आशिर्
आ-शिर्
 (‘admixture’) denotes the mixing, and more especially the milk mixed with the juice, of the Soma before it was offered to the gods. In this sense it is not rare from the Rigveda 1) i. 134, 6; iii. 53, 14; viii. 2, 10. 11, etc.; Av. ii. 29, 1, etc.; Nirukta, vi. 8; 32. onwards. Not milk alone was employed for this purpose. The epithet ‘having three admixtures’ applied to Soma 2) Rv. v. 27, 5; cf. viii. 2, 7. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 209 et seq. is explained by the other epithets, ‘mixed with milk’ (gava1s4ir), ‘mixed with curds’ (dadhy-a1s4ir), and ‘mixed with grain’ (yava1s4ir)--all referring to Soma.

आशीविष
आशी-विष,
 occurring only in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) vi. 1. is understood by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. It is a common word in the Epic and later. as designating a particular kind of snake, and perhaps means ‘having poison (vis2a) in its fangs’ (a1s4i1).

 the ‘swift,’ is frequently used without As4va to denote the chariot steed from the Rigveda 1) ii. 16, 3; 31, 2; 38, 3, etc.; Av. ii. 14, 6; iv. 27, 1; xiii. 2, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 10; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 3, 3, etc. onwards. 

आशुंग
आशुं-ग
 in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 14, 3. seems to denote some sort of animal. It is qualified by the word ‘young’ (s4is4uka), and Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. suggests that it may mean a bird (‘swift-flying’), or that the expression denotes ‘a foal going to its dam’ (a1s4u-ga). Sa1yan2a, however, reads the accompanying word as s4us4uka, which he assumes to denote an animal. Bloomfield 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 464. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 291. renders the two words ‘a swift (a1s4um2ga) foal (s4is4uka),’ thus agreeing with one of Roth's suggestions in sense, though not in the explanation of As4um2ga.

आश्रम
आ-श्रम
 (‘resting-place’) does not occur in any Upanis2ad which can be regarded as pre-Buddhistic. Its earliest use as denoting the stages of a Hindu's life is found in the S4veta1s4vatara Upanis2ad. 1) Atya1s4ramin, S4veta1s4vatara Upanis2ad, vi. 21; Maitra1yan2i1 Upanis2ad, iv. 3, etc. In one passage 2) viii. 5. of the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad reference is made only to the Brahmaca1rin and householder, to whom, as a reward for study, the procreation of children, the practice of Yoga, abstention from injury to living creatures, and sacrifices, freedom from transmigration are promised. In another place 3) ii. 23, 1. three states are contemplated, but not as consecutive. The Brahmaca1rin may either become a householder or become an anchorite, or remain in his teacher's house all his life. Similarly, reference 4) v. 10. is made to the death of the anchorite in the forest, or the sacrifice in the village. In contrast with all three 5) ii. 23, 1. is the man who stands fast in Brahman (Brahmasam2stha). In the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 6) iv. 2, 22. Cf. iii. 5. the knower of the A1tman is contrasted with those who (1) study, or (2) sacrifice and give alms, or (3) are anchorites, and in another place 7) iii. 8, 10. with those who sacrifice and make benefactions, and those who practice asceticism. This position of superiority to, and distinction from, the A1s4ramas became later a fourth 8) Ja1ba1la Upanis2ad, 4. Cf. Mun2d2aka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 7. A1s4rama, the Gr2hastha, or householder, who was in the second stage, being required to pass not only into the stage of Va1naprastha, but also that of the Sannya1sin (Bhiks2u, Parivra1jaka). The first stage, that of the Brahmaca1rin, was still obligatory, but was no longer allowed to remain a permanent one, as was originally possible. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 60, 367 et seq.

आश्रेषा

 See Naks2atra.

आश्वघ्न
आश्व-घ्न
 --This name occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 61, 21. in a very obscure hymn, where it appears to denote a prince who had made offerings to Indra, and who may, as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. thinks, have been called Vitaran2a.

अश्वतरआश्वि
अश्वतर आश्वि,
 or A1s4vatara1s4vi.--These two expressions are used 1) The first is found in Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 30; the second in Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 6, 1, 9; x. 6, 1, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 15, 8; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 11, 1; 16, 1. as patronymics of Bud2ila, denoting, according to Sa1yan2a, 2) On Aitareya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. that he was son of As4va, and descendant of As4vatara.

अश्वत्थ्य
अश्व-त्थ्य
 --Patronymic of Ahi1na1. 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 9, 10. Possibly to be read A1s4vathya.

अश्वमेध
अश्व-मेध
 is the patronymic of an unnamed prince, who occurs in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda (viii. 68, 15. 16).

आश्ववाल
आश्व-वाल
 --From this adjective (‘made of horse-tail grass’), applied to a strew (prastara) in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (iii. 4, 1, 17; 6, 3, 10), follows the existence of the As4vava1la grass (Saccharum spontaneum).

आश्वसूक्ति
आश्व-सूक्ति
 is mentioned in Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xix. 4, 2, et seq.) as an author of Sa1mans (Soma chants) along with Gausu1kti. 

आश्विन
आश्विन,
 or A1s4vi1na, designates, in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 131, 3. and two Bra1hman2as, 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 17; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a in Indische Studien, 1, 34. the length of journey made in a day by a horseman (as4vin). The exact distance is not defined. In the Atharva it appears to exceed five leagues, being mentioned immediately after a distance of three or five Yojanas; in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a the heavenly world is placed at a distance of a thousand A1s4vinas.

आषाधिसौश्रोमतेय
आषाधि सौश्रोमतेय
 --According to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) vi. 2, 1, 37. Eggeling has As2a1d2hi, but as it is a patronymic of As2a1d2ha, the form A1s2a1d2hi seems correct. he was ruined because the heads were put on at the Agniciti in a certain manner, and not correctly.

आष्ट्रा
आष्ट्रा
 seems in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 (xxxvii. 1) to denote the ploughman's goad.

आष्ट्री
आष्ट्री
 --In the Rigveda 1) x. 165, 3. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 347. the word seems to denote a fireplace. The evil bird is entreated not to settle there on the hearth.

आसङ्गप्लायोगि
आसङ्ग प्लायोगि
 is a king who appears in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda 1) viii. 1, 32. 33. as a generous patron. Owing, however, to the addition of a curious phallic verse to the hymn, and its early misunderstanding, 2) viii. 1, 34. See Hopkins, Religions of India, 150, n. 1; Br2haddevata1, ii. 83; vi. 41, with Macdonell's notes. Dya1dvi. eda gives the tale at length in Vedic words taken from the Nighan2t2u, a curious jeu d'esprit. See the extract from the Ni1timan5jari1 given by Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 40, 41. a legend was invented that he lost his manhood and became a woman, but by the intercession of Medhya1tithi was transformed into a man, much to the delight of his wife, S4as4vati1, whose existence is based on a misunderstanding of the phrase ‘every woman’ (s4as4vati1 na1ri1) in the added verse. 3) viii. 1, 34. Another misunderstanding of the Da1nastuti 4) viii. 1, 31. 32. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 89; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 106, 107; Oldenberg. R2gveda-Noten, 1, 354. gives him a son Svanad-ratha, really a mere epithet, and makes him a descendant of Yadu.

आसन्दी
आ-सन्दी
 --This is a generic term for a seat of some sort, occurring frequently in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Av. xiv. 2, 65; xv. 3, 2 et seq.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 8, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 56; xix. 16; 86, etc. and Bra1hman2as. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 5; 6; 12; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 26; v. 2, 1, 22; 4, 4, 1, etc. but not in the Rigveda. In the Atharvaveda 3) xv. 3, 2 et seq. the settle brought for the Vra1tya is described at length. It had two feet, lengths wise and cross-pieces, forward and cross-cords, showing that it was made of wood and also cording. It was also covered with a cushion (A1staran2a) and a pillow (Upabarhan2a), had a seat (A1sa1da) and a support (Upas4raya). Similar seats are described in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 4) i. 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 397; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana Aranyaka, 19. and the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a. 5) ii. 24. The seat for the king at the royal consecration is described in very similar terms in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 6) viii. 5; 6; 12. where the height of the feet is placed at a span, and the lengthwise and cross-pieces are each to be a cubit, while the interwoven part (vivayana) is to be of Mun5ja grass, and the seat of Udumbara wood. In another passage of the Atharvaveda 7) xiv. 2, 65. See his note in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 765. Lanman seems to take the seat meant as a ‘long reclining chair.’ There also a cushion (Upadha1na) and coverlet (Upava1sana) are mentioned. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a repeatedly describes the A1sandi1 in terms showing that it was an elaborate seat. In one place 8) v. 4, 4, 1. it is said to be made of Khadira wood, perforated (vi-tr2n2n2a1), and joined with straps (vardhra-yuta1) like that of the Bha1ratas. At the Sautra1man2i1 rite 9) xii. 8, 3, 4 et seq. (an Indra sacrifice) the seat is of Udumbara wood, is knee-high, and of unlimited width and depth, and is covered with plaited reed-work. The imperial seat 10) xiv. 1, 3, 8 et seq. is to be shoulder-high, of Udumbara wood, and wound all over with cords of Balvaja grass (Eleusina indica). Elsewhere 11) vi. 7, 1, 12 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. the seat is a span high, a cubit in width and depth, of Udumbara wood, and covered with reed-grass cords, and daubed with clay.

आसन्दीवन्त्
आसन्दी-वन्त्,
 ‘possessing the throne,’ is the title of the royal city of Janamejaya Pa1riks2ita, in which the horse, for his famous As4vamedha, was bound. The authorities both cite a Ga1tha1 for the fact, but they differ as to the priest who celebrated the rite. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 5, 4, 2. he is stated to have been Indrota Daiva1pa S4aunaka, but in the Aitareya 2) viii. 21. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 9, 1. Pa1n2ini, viii. 2, 12, knows the name. Tura Ka1vas2eya.

आसाद
आ-साद,
 ‘seat,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) xv. 3, 8. as a description of part of the settle (A1sandi1) of the Vra1tya. It seems best to regard it with Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 771. as the seat proper; Aufrecht, 3) Indische Studien, 1, 131. Zimmer, 4) Altindisches Leben, 155. and Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. render it as the ‘cushion for the seat,’ but that is sufficiently described by the word A1staran2a.

आसुरायण
आसुरायण
 is mentioned as a pupil of Traivan2i in the first two Vam2s4as 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3. (lists of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad in both recensions, but as a pupil of A1suri in the third Vam2s4a. 2) vi. 5, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 434, n.

आसुरि
आसुरि
 occurs in the first two Vam2s4as 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3. (lists of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad as a pupil of Bha1radva1ja and teacher of Aupajandhani, but in the third 2) vi. 5, 2. as a pupil of Ya1jn5avalkya and teacher of A1sura1yan2a. He appears as a ritual authority in the first four books of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) i. 6, 3, 26; ii. 1, 4, 27; 3, 1, 9; 4, 1, 2; 6, 1, 25. 33; 3, 17; iv. 5, 8, 14. and as an authority on dogmatic, specially noted for his insistence on truth, in the last book. 4) xiv. 1, 1, 33, and notes 1, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 430 et seq., whose suggestion of the identity of this teacher and the founder of the Sa1m2khya system is not, however, acceptable. See Garbe, Sa1m2khya Philosophie, 29, 30.

आसुरिवासिन्
आसुरि-वासिन्
 is a name of Pra1s4ni1-putra in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 5, 2, in both recensions).

आसेचन
आ-सेचन
 designates a vessel to hold liquids, such as meat juice (yu1s2an) 1) Rv. i. 162, 13. or ghee. 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 9, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271. Of its shape and make we know nothing.

आस्तरण
आ-स्तरण
 denotes the coverlet of the settle (A1sandi1) of the Vra1tya. 1) Av. xv. 3, 7. A tiger's skin serves as the coverlet of the king's seat in the royal consecration (Ra1jasu1ya). 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 5. In the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 3) i. 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. the word used is Upastaran2a.

आस्त्रबुध्न
आस्त्र-बुध्न
 is the name of a man whom Indra is said in the Rigveda 1) x. 171, 3. to have assisted. It is not clear whether Venya, who is mentioned in the same line, was his friend 2) So Grassmann and Griffith in their translations. or his enemy, 3) So Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 167. whom Indra saved or defeated for him.

आस्थातृ
आ-स्थातृ
 --The warrior in the chariot is once thus designated (as ‘standing on the car’) in the Rigveda. 1) vi. 47, 26. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296. Normally he is named Rathin or Rathes2t2ha1. 

आस्राव
आ-स्राव
 (‘discharge’) denotes a disease, thrice referred to in the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 2, 4; ii. 3, 2; vi. 44, 2. the precise nature of which is uncertain. The Scholiast 2) On Av. i. 2, 4. Cf. on ii. 3, 2. in one place interprets it as painful urination (mu1tra1tisa1ra), while Lanman 3) In Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 3. suggests diabetes. Bloomfield 4) American Journal of Philology, 7, 467; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, cxiii; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 233, 234. takes it to be diarrhœa, and Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 392. argues that as the remedy is called ‘wound healer’ (arus-sra1n2a), the sense is ‘the flux from unhealed wounds.’ Whitney 6) Op. cit., 3, 41. renders it ‘flux,’ and questions Bloomfield's rendering. Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 507, 509. translates it vaguely by ‘sickness’ and ‘cold.’

आहनस्या
आहनस्या
 (‘unchaste’).--This word in the plural (‘lascivious verses’) denotes a section (xx. 136) of the Kunta1pa hymns of the Atharvaveda, which are of an obscene character. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 36; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 7. Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 99.

आहाव
आ-हाव
 denotes a pail or bucket, especially in conjunction with a well (Avata). 1) Rv. i. 34, 8; vi. 7, 2; x. 101, 5; 112, 6; Nirukta, v. 26.

आह्नेय
आह्नेय
 --Patronymic of Sauca (Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 12). I.

इक्षु
इक्षु,
 the generic name for the sugar-cane, is first found in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 34, 5. and the later Sam2hita1s. 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 7, 9; iv. 2, 9 (iks2u-ka1n2d2a). In Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxv. 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hit2a1, vii. 3, 16, 1; Ka1t2haka As4vamedha, in. 8, ‘eyelash’ is meant. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Whether it grew wild, or was cultivated, does not appear from the references. 

इक्ष्वाकु
इक्ष्वाकु
 --In the Rigveda this name occurs but once, 1) x. 60, 4. and in a doubtful context. It is clear, however, that it denotes a prince; later interpretations make Asama1ti, whose name is read into the hymn, an Iks2va1ku prince. 2) Cf. Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 167; Sa1t2ya1yanaka in Max Mu7ller, Rigveda, 4, c-cvii, 167; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 42; Br2haddevata1, vii. 85 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. In the Atharvaveda 3) xiv. 39, 9. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 680; Whitney Translation of the Atharvaveda, 961. also the name is found in only one passage, where it is uncertain whether a descendant of Iks2va1ku, or Iks2va1ku himself, is referred to; in either case he seems to be regarded as an ancient hero. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 4) xiii. 3, 12. mention is made of Tryarun2a Traidha1tva Aiks2va1ka, who is identical with the Tryarun2a Traivr2s2n2a of the Br2haddevata1, 5) v. 14 et seq. and with Tryarun2a Trasadasyu in the Rigveda. 6) v. 27, 3. Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 68-75; Macdonell, Br2haddevata1, 2, 170; Oldenberg, Vedic Hymns, 366 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133, 138; 4, 324. The connection of Trasadasyu with the Iks2va1kus is confirmed by the fact that Purukutsa was an Aiks2va1ka, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 7) xiii. 5, 4, 5. Thus the Iks2va1ku line was originally a line of princes of the Pu1rus. Zimmer 8) Altindisches Leben, 104, 130. places them on the upper Indus, but they may well have been somewhat further east. 9) Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218; Geldner, ibid., 3, 152. Later Iks2va1ku is connected with Ayodhya1

इट
1. It2a. --This word occurs twice in the Atharvaveda. in the first passage 1) vi. 14, 3. Cf. iv. 19, 1; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 464. it seems to denote a bulrush of the sort that dies in a year; in the second 2) ix. 3, 18. Cf. Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 35, 718. it refers to the reed work of the house.

इट
2. It2a appears as a R2s2i and a prote4ge4 of Indra in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) x. 171, 1. Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, thinks that the word is really part of a verb (it2) meaning ‘to err, wander’ (cp. at2), and that the name is a mere misunderstanding. It is already so regarded in the Anukraman2i1, but not apparently in the Br2haddevata1. 3) viii. 73. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133.

इटन्त्काव्य
इटन्त् काव्य
 is the name of a sage, contemporary with Kes4in Da1rbhya, in the Kaus2itaki Bra1hman2a. 1) vii. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 293; 2, 308. He is also mentioned as Id2hant in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 2) xiv. 9, 16.

इतिहास
इतिहास,
 as a kind of literature, is repeatedly mentioned along with Pura1n2a in the later texts of the Vedic period. The earliest reference to both occurs in the late fifteenth book of the Atharvaveda. 1) xv. 6, 4 et seq. Itiha1sa then appears in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) xiii. 4, 3, 12. 13, and as compounded in xi. 5, 6, 8; 7, 9. the Jaimini1ya, 3) i. 53. Br2hada1ran2yaka, 4) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; v. 11. and Cha1ndogya Upanis2ads. 5) iii. 4, 1. 2; vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. In the latter it is expressly declared with Pura1n2a to make up the fifth Veda, while the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 6) xvi. 2, 21. 27. makes the Itiha1sa a Veda and the Pura1n2a a Veda. The Itiha1sa-veda and the Pura1n2a-veda appear also in the Gopatha Bra1hman2a, 7) i. 10. while the S4atapatha 8) xiii. 4, 3, 12. 13. identifies the Itiha1sa as well as the Pura1n2a with the Veda. In one passage Anva1khya1na and Itiha1sa are distinguished 9) xi. 1, 6, 9. Cf. p. 24. as different classes of works, but the exact point of distinction is obscure; probably the former was supplementary. The Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 10) ii. 9. mentions Itiha1sas and Pura1n2as in the plural. There is nothing to show in the older literature what distinction there was, if any, between Itiha1sa and Pura1n2a; and the late literature, 11) See Sa1yan2a's Introduction to the Rigveda, p. 12 (ed. Max Mu7ller), and his commentary on Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 6, 8; S4am2kara on Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 4, 10. which has been elaborately examined by Sieg, 12) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 31 et seq. yields no consistent result. Geldner 13) Vedische Studien, 1, 290. Cf. Sieg, op. cit., 33. has conjectured that there existed a single work, the Itiha1sa-pura1n2a, a collection of the old legends of all sorts, heroic, cosmogonic, genealogical; but though a work called Itiha1sa, and another called Pura1n2a, were probably known to Patan5jali, 14) Va1rttika on Pa1n2ini, iv. 2, 60, and Maha1bha1s2ya (ed. Kielhorn), 2, 284. the inaccuracy of Geldner's view is proved by the fact that Ya1ska shows no sign of having known any such work. To him the Itiha1sa may be a part of the Mantra literature itself, 15) Nirukta, iv. 6. Aitiha1sikas being merely people who interpret the Rigveda by seeing in it legends where others see myths. 16) Ibid., ii. 16; xii. 1. The fact, however, that the use of the compound form is rare, and that Ya1ska regularly has Itiha1sa, 17) Ibid., ii. 10; 24; iv. 6; x. 26; xii. 10. not Itiha1sa-pura1n2a, is against the theory of there ever having been one work. The relation of Itiha1sa to A1khya1na is also uncertain. Sieg 18) Op. cit., 31 et seq. considers that the words Itiha1sa and Pura1n2a referred to the great body of mythology, legendary history, and cosmogonic legend available to the Vedic poets, and roughly classed as a fifth Veda, though not definitely and finally fixed. Thus, Anva1khya1nas, Anuvya1khya1nas, and Vya1khya1nas could arise, and separate A1khya1nas could still exist outside the cycle, while an A1khya1na could also be a part of the Itiha1sa-pura1n2a. He also suggests that the word A1khya1na has special reference to the form of the narrative. Oldenberg, 19) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 37, 54 et seq.; 39, 52 et seq. Cf. also Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1908, 67 et seq. following Windisch, 20) Verhandlungen der dreiunddreissigsten Versammlung deutcher Philologen und Sckulma7nner in Gera (1879), 15 et seq. and followed by Geldner, 21) Vedische Studien, 1, 284; 2, 1 et seq. Sieg, and others, has found in the A1khya1na form a mixture of prose and verse, alternating as the narrative was concerned with the mere accessory parts of the tale, or with the chief points, at which the poetic form was naturally produced to correspond with the stress of the emotion. This theory has been severely criticized by Hertel 22) Vienna Oriental Journal, 18, 59 et seq.; 23, 273 et seq. Cf. Winternitz, ibid., 23, 102 et seq. and von Schroeder. 23) Mystcrium und Mimus im Rigveda, 3 et seq. These scholars, in accordance with older suggestions of Max Mu7ller 24) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 183. and Le4vi, 25) Le The4a10tre indien, 303, 307. see in the so-called A1khya1na hymns of the Rigveda, in which Oldenberg finds actual specimens of the supposed literary genus, though the prose has been lost, actual remains of ritual dramas. Elsewhere 26) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 200 et seq. it has been suggested that the hymns in question are merely literary dialogues.

 is mentioned as a teacher who with others was unable to agree as to the nature of Agni Vais4va1nara, and who was instructed by As4vapati Kaikeya. 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 1, 1 et seq.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 11, 1 et seq. As Bha1llaveya he is cited several times in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) i. 6, 1, 19; xiii. 5, 3, 4. Cf. ii. 1, 4. 6. on ritual points.

 is mentioned as a pupil of Mitrabhu1 Ka1s4yapa in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 374.

इन्द्रोत
1. Indrota is twice mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 68, 10 et seq. in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Liberality’) as a giver of gifts. In the second passage he has the epithet A1tithigva, which shows conclusively that he was a son of Atithigva, as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. holds, and not of R2ks2a, as Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. states.

2. Indrota Daiva1pa S4aunaka is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 5, 3, 5; 4, 1; Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xvi. 7, 7; 8, 27. as the priest who officiated at the horse sacrifice of Janamejaya, although this honour is attributed in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 2) viii. 21. to Tura Ka1vas2eya. He also appears in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 3) iii. 40, 1. as a pupil of S4ruta, and is mentioned in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 4) Indische Studien, 4, 384, 385. He cannot be connected in any way with Deva1pi, who occurs in the Rigveda. 5) x. 98. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 240.

इभ
1. Ibha is a word of somewhat doubtful sense and interpretation. It is found only in the Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 2, 14, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 9. and especially in the Rigveda. 2) i. 84, 17; iv. 4, 1; ix. 57, 3, and perhaps vi. 20, 8. According to Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 246, 247. the sense is ‘retainer,’ and Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 167. thinks that it includes not only dependants and servants, but also the royal family and the youthful cadets of the chief families. In the opinion of Pischel and Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 1, xv, xvi. it denotes ‘elephant.’ This view is supported by the authority of the commentators Sa1yan2a 7) On Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, loc. cit. and Mahi1dhara; 8) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. the Nirukta, 9) vi. 12. It gives also the sense ‘retainer,’ and in As4oka's Edicts, No. 5, Bu7hler, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 37, 279, finds a Vais4ya denoted by its Pa1li form. too, gives ‘elephant’ as one of the senses of the word. Megasthenes 10) Apud Strabo, 704. and Nearchos 11) Ibid., 705. tell us that elephants were a royal prerogative, and the derivative word Ibhya may thus be naturally explained as denoting merely ‘rich’ (lit., ‘possessor of elephants’). 12) But it may equally well be explained as ‘rich’ from the other sense of the primary word: ‘possessor of (many) retainers.’

इभ
2. Ibha in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 8. Cf. Pischel and Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, xvi; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 380. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 167, treats it as ‘retinue,’ as does Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 246, 247. appears certainly to be intended as an abbreviation of the proper name Smadibha. 

इभ्य
इभ्य
 occurs once in the Rigveda 1) i. 65, 4. in the plural, when a king is said to devour his Ibhyas as the fire the forest; and twice in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 2) i. 10, 1. 2. in one passage as the first member of a compound, and in the other as either a proper name or an adjective. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Ludwig, 4) Translation of the Rigveda 3, 247. and Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 168. interpret the word as ‘retainers’ in the Rigveda, but in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad Roth thinks it means ‘rich.’ Pischel and Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 1, xvi. Cf. Sa1yan2a on Rigveda, loc. cit., dhaninah2, and S4am2kara on Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, loc. cit., i1s4varo hastya1roho va1; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 476. Cf. also Little, Grammatical Index, 35. accept the sense in all passages. Bo7htlingk in his translation of the Cha1ndogya treats the word as simply a proper name, ‘Ibhya's village’ (ibhya-gra1ma) and ‘Ibhya.’

इरिण
इरिण
 (neut.) occurs not rarely in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Av. iv. 15, 12; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 1, 3; iii. 4, 8, 5; v. 2, 4, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 16. and Bra1hman2as 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 3, 2; vii. 2, 1, 8. in the sense of ‘a cleft in the ground,’ usually natural (sva-kr2ta). The same meaning is also, as Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 222-225. shows, to be ascribed to it in three passages of the Rigveda, 4) i. 186, 9; viii. 4, 3; 87, 1. 4. in one 5) viii. 4, 3. of which the hole is referred to as ‘made by water’ (apa1 kr2tam). In another passage of the Rigveda 6) x. 34, 1. 9. the word refers to the place on which the dice are thrown. Hence Pischel 7) Op. cit., 2, 225. concludes that the dicing-board must have been so called because it contained holes into which the dice had to be thrown if possible. Lu7ders, 8) Das Wu7rfelspiel im alben Indian, 14. however, points out that this assumption is not necessary; the dice (Aks2a) were merely thrown on a space dug out, which could be called Irin2a, as being a hole in the ground, though not a natural one. This view is supported by the commentary of Sa1yan2a, 9) On Rv., loc. cit. (a1-sphu1ra). as well as by Durga in his note on the Nirukta. 10) ix. 8 (a1sphuraka-stha1na). 

इषश्यावाश्वि
इष श्यावाश्वि
 is mentioned in a Vam2s4a (‘list of teachers’) of the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iv. 16, 1) as a pupil of Agastya.

इषीका
इषीका,
 ‘a stalk of reed grass,’ occurs frequently from the Atharvaveda 1) Av. vii. 56, 4; xii. 2, 54; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 4, 16, etc.; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 9; ii. 134; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 24, 3; Ka1t2haka Upanis2ad, ii. 6, 17, etc.; Nirukta, ix. 8. onwards, often as an emblem of fragility. In the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 2) ii. 16 (v. l. ºike). it seems to denote the pin fixed in the bar of a pen to keep cattle in (argales2i1ke, ‘bolt and pin’). A basket (s4u1rpa) of Is2i1ka1 is referred to in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 3) i. 1, 4, 19. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71; Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 122, n. 3.

इषु
इषु
 is the usual name for ‘arrow’ from the Rigveda 1) ii. 24, 8; viii. 7, 4, etc.; Av. i. 13, 4, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 3, etc.; Nirukta, ix. 18. onwards. Other names are S4arya, S4a1ri1, and Ba1n2a. In the hymn of the Rigveda, 2) vi. 75, 15. which gives a catalogue of armour, two kinds of arrows are distinctly referred to: the one is poisoned (a1la1kta1), and has a head of horn (ruru-s4i1rs2n2i1); the other is copper-, bronze-, or iron-headed (ayo-mukham). Poisoned (digdha1) arrows are also referred to in the Atharvaveda. 3) iv. 6, 7; v. 18, 8. 15; 31, 4. The arrows were feathered. 4) Rv. x. 18, 14; vi. 75, 11; Av. v. 25, 1. The parts of an arrow are enumerated in the Atharvaveda 5) iv. 6. as the shaft (s4alya), the feather-socket (parn2a-dhi), the point (s4r2n3ga), the neck of the point in which the shaft is fixed (kulmala), and the Apaskambha and Apa1s2t2ha, which are of more doubtful significance. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 6) i. 25. the parts of an arrow are given as the point (ani1ka), the s4alya, tejana, and the feathers (parn2a1ni), where s4alya and tejana must apparently mean the upper and lower parts of the shaft, since it is reasonable to suppose that the arrow is described as a whole consecutively. So in the Atharvaveda 7) Av. iii. 25, 2. the arrow of Ka1ma is described as having feathers, a shaft (s4alya), and a firm fastening (kulmala). 8) See also Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 8, 1. 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 1. The arrow was shot from the ear, and so is described in the Rigveda 9) Rv. vi. 75, 3; ii. 24, 8 (karn2ayoni). as ‘having the ear for its place of birth.’ As a measure of length, the Is2u was five spans, say three feet. 10) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 5, 2, 10. A regular profession of arrow-making existed (is2u-kr2t, 11) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 46, Cf. Rv. i. 184, 3. is2u-ka1ra). 12) Ibid., xxx. 7; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 3, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 300; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 29, 286; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 275 et seq.; 25, 337.

इषुत्रिकाण्डा
इषु त्रि-काण्डा
 is the name given in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 33. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 205, n. to some constellation, perhaps Orion's girdle. It is mentioned with Mr2ga, Mr2gavya1dha, and Rohin2i1.

इषुधि
इषु-धि
 (‘arrow-holder’) is the name of the quiver which was carried by every bowman. The word is common from the Rigveda 1) i. 33, 3; vi. 75, 5; x. 95, 3; Av. ii. 33, 2; iv. 10, 6, etc.; Nirukta, ix. 13. onwards. No trace is to be found in Vedic literature of the later practice of carrying two quivers. 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 274. Each quiver held from ten to twenty arrows. According to Pischel, 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 17. But see Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 182. the curious expression is2u-kr2t in the Rigveda 4) i. 184, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 300. means quiver. I1.

ईषा
ईषा
 denotes the ‘pole of a chariot.’ Normally the chariot had one pole (ekes2ah2), 1) Rv. x. 135, 3; iii. 53, 17; viii. 5, 29; Av. viii. 8, 23. but sometimes two poles are referred to. 2) Cf. Av. ii. 8, 4; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 12 (i1s2a1-yuga1ni, but in iii. 9, 4, 3 dual); Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vii. 9, 14, etc. The word is often 3) Av., loc. cit., etc. compounded with Yuga, ‘yoke,’ into which it was fastened (see Kha), and tied with ropes. 4) Rv. x. 60, 8. Cf. iii. 6, 6. Exactly how it was attached to the chariot we do not know. 5) Va1n2i1 in Rv. i. 119, 5 is taken by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249, to refer to the front part of the chariot, but it seems simply to be ‘voice.’ See also Ratha. U.

उक्षण्यायन

 is mentioned in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda 1) viii. 25, 22. along with Haraya1n2a and Sus2a1man. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162, 270. thinks that all three are identical. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. finds a reference to Uks2an himself in the verb uks2an2yati 4) Rv. viii. 26, 9. and in the adjective uks2an2yu. 5) Rv. viii. 23, 16.

उक्ष्णोरन्ध्रकाव्य
उक्ष्णो-रन्ध्र काव्य
 is mentioned as a seer in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiii. 9, 19). 1) Cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 397.

उखा
उखा
 is the regular word or a ‘cooking pot,’ usually mentioned in connexion with sacrifice, from the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 13. 15; iii. 53, 22; Av. xii. 3, 23; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 6, 3, etc. onwards. It was made of clay (mr2n2-mayi1). 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 59; Taitdri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 5, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 253, 271. See also Stha1li1.

उग्र
उग्र
 in one passage of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) iv. 3, 37. 38. seems to have a technical force, denoting ‘man in authority,’ or according to Max Mu7ller's rendering, ‘policeman.’ Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. compares a passage in the Rigveda, 3) vii. 38, 6. where, however, the word has simply the general sense of ‘mighty man.’ Bo7htlingk, 4) P. 66 (with pratyenasah2). in his rendering of the Upanis2ad, treats the word as merely adjectival.

उग्रदेव
उग्र-देव
 is mentioned with Turvas4a and Yadu in the Rigveda 1) i. 36, 18 (Ugra1deva). apparently as a powerful protector. The name occurs also in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11. and the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, 3) v. 4, 12. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., who suggests that in the Rv. passage the word should be taken adjectivally. where he is styled Ra1jani and called a leper (kila1sa). 

उग्रसेन
उग्र-सेन
 is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xiii. 5, 4, 3), and in a Ga1tha1 there cited as being, with Bhi1masena and S4rutasena, a Pa1riks2iti1ya and a brother of Janamejaya. The brothers were cleansed by the horse sacrifice from sin.

उच्चैःश्रवस्कौपयेय
उच्चैः-श्रवस् कौपयेय
 appears in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 29, 1-3) as a king of the Kurus and as maternal uncle of Kes4in. His connexion with the Kurus is borne out by the fact that Upamas4ravas was son of Kurus4ravan2a, the names being strikingly similar.

उच्छीर्षक
उच्-छीर्षक
 --This word, occurring in the description of the couch (paryan3ka) in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 403; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. (i. 5), apparently denotes a cushion for the head. See also A1sandi1.

उत्तरकुरु
उत्तर कुरु
 --The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) viii. 14. where they are located beyond the Hima1laya (paren2a Himavantam). In another passage, 2) viii. 23. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 165; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 101, 102; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 75, n. however, the country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Va1sis2t2ha Sa1tyahavya to be a land of the gods (deva-ks2etra), but Ja1nam2tapi Atyara1ti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the northern Kurus were settled in Kas4mi1r, especially as Kuruks2etra is the region where tribes advancing from Kas4mi1r might naturally be found. Cf. Udi1cyas.

उत्तरमद्र
उत्तर मद्र
 is the name of a tribe mentioned with the Uttara Kurus in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) viii. 14. as living beyond the Hima1laya. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 102. points out that in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 3) Indische Studien, 4, 371. Ka1mboja Aupamanyava is a pupil of Madraga1ra, and thence infers that Kambojas and Madras were not far distant in space. This conclusion is perfectly reasonable in view of the probable position of the Ka1mbojas. 4) See map in Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, p. 332. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 165.

उत्तानआङ्गिरस
उत्-तान आङ्गिरस
 is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 3, 2, 5. Cf. ii. 2, 5, 3. as a quasi-mythical person who received all good things, and yet was not harmed, as he was really a form of the earth, according to Sa1yan2a's 2) On Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 2, 5. explanation. His name occurs also in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 3) ix. 9. the Pancavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 4) i. 8, 11. and the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 5) iii. 10, 2. 3.

 --His views on Brahman, which he identified with the vital airs (pra1n2a), are mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (iv. 1, 3). He would thus have been a contemporary of Janaka of Videha. He is also mentioned in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (vii. 5, 4, 2) as holding that the Das4ara1tra ceremony was the prosperity or best part of the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’).

उदञ्चन
उद्-अञ्चन
 --This word, occurring only metaphorically in the Rigveda, 1) v. 44, 13 (dhiya1m udan5canah2, ‘a very well of prayers’). means a ‘pail’ or ‘bucket’ in the Bra1hman2as. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 32; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 5, 21.

उदल,
 a Vais4va1mitra, is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2sa Bra1hman2a (xiv. 11, 33) as the seer of a Sa1man. 

उदाज
उद्-आज
 is the word used in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 1) i. 10, 16; iv. 3, 1. to denote the share of the booty of war taken by the king after a victory (sam2gra1mam2 jitva1). This interpretation, which is that of Delbru7ck, 2) Festgruss an Bo7htlingk, 25. is clearly correct, as against the older version, ‘march out,’ given by von Schroeder 3) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 1, xv. and accepted by Bo7htlingk. 4) Dictionary, s.v. The Uda1ja thus corresponds precisely with the Homeric  This sense also suits Nira1ja, the variant of both the Ka1t2haka 5) xxviii. 3. and the Kapis2t2hala 6) xliv. 3. Sam2hita1s.

 is usually the fifth of the vital breaths (Pra1n2a) when five are enumerated. 1) E.g., Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 12, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, v. 4; 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 2, 2, 5; xi. 8, 3, 6 (in the order Pra1n2a, Vya1na, Apa1na, Uda1na, Sama1na); Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 5, 3; iii. 4, 1 (Sama1na is omitted); iii. 9, 26; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 13, 5; v. 23, 1. 2; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 3, 3, etc. Sometimes 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 20; vii. 27; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 4, 2, 10, etc. (with Vya1na); Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 2 (with Sama1na). it appears as the second, coming after Pra1n2a, and followed by Vya1na or Sama1na. Again, 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vi. 20; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 2, 2; ix. 2, 4, 5, etc. it is found simply opposed to Pra1n2a, or it simply follows Pra1n2a and Apa1na. 4) S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 8; xi. 1. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 5) xi. 2, 4, 5. it is treated as the breath that consumes food, a notion traceable in the later Upanis2ads, 6) Maitra1yan2i1 Upanis2ad, ii. 6. while it is also regarded as the wind that rises up by the throat, 7) Amr2tabindu Upanis2ad, 34. and leads the spirit forth at death. 8) Pras4na Upanis2ad, iii. 7. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanis2ads, 280.

 --The Bra1hman2as of the northern parts are referred to in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xi. 4, 1, 1. Cf. Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 6. as engaging, with Svaida1yana S4aunaka as their spokesman, in a dispute with the Kurupan5ca1la Bra1hman2a Udda1laka A1run2i, and as vanquishing him. Their relation to the Kurupan5ca1las appears also from the fact that in the same Bra1hman2a 2) iii. 2, 3, 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 191; Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 35. reference is made to the speech of the north being similar to that of the Kurupan5ca1las. The speech of the Northerners was also celebrated for purity; hence Bra1hman2as used to go to the north for purposes of study, according to the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, 3) vii. 6. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 1, 153; 2, 309. while in the Buddhist texts the school of Taks2as4ila1 (in Gandha1ra) is famous as a resort of students. 4) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 8, 28, 203. Possibly, too, Sanskrit was specially developed in Kas4mi1r, as suggested by Franke. 5) Cf. Pa1li und Sanskrit (1902), 88, 89. See also Kuru.

For ritual purposes of all kinds its wood was constantly used. The sacrificial post (yu1pa) 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 1, 6. and the sacrificial ladle 3) Ibid., v. 4, 7, 3. were made of it, and amulets of Udumbara are mentioned. 4) Atharvaveda, xix. 31, 1. Its wood, like that of other kinds of figtree-As4vattha, Nyagrodha, and Plaks2a--was considered suitable for employment at the sacrifice. 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 8, 4. The sweetness of its fruit is referred to in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 6) vii. 15. where it is put on the same level as Madhu. It is there also spoken of as ripening three times a year. 7) v. 24.

Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 6. This statement is confirmed by the fact that he was teacher of Proti Kausurubindi of Kaus4a1mbi1, 2) xii. 2, 2, 13. and that his son Svetaketu is found disputing among the Pan5ca1las. 3) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 1; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 3, 1. He was a pupil of Arun2a, his father, 4) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 33 (in both recensions). as well as of Patan5cala Ka1pya, 5) Ibid., iii. 7, 1. of Madra, while he was the teacher of the famous Ya1jn5avalkya 6) Ibid., vi. 3, 15; 4, 33. Va1jasaneya and of Kaus2i1taki, 7) S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xv. although the former is represented elsewhere 8) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 7, 31. as having silenced him. He overcame in argument Pra1ci1nayogya S4auceya, 9) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 3, 1 et seq. and apparently also Bhadrasena A1ja1tas4atrava, 10) v. 5, 5, 14. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 141, has A1ran2i. There is a chronological difficulty in taking A1run2i as meant, since A1ja1tas4atrava must presumably have been a descendant of Aja1tas4atru, a contemporary of Janaka (see Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 1), who again was a patron of Ya1jn5avalkya, a pupil of A1run2i. But this difficulty is not fatal. though the text here seems to read the name as A1ran2i. He was a Gautama, 11) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 3, 2; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 1. and is often alluded to as such. As an authority on questions of ritual and philosophy, he is repeatedly referred to by his patronymic name A1run2i in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 12) i. 1, 2, 11; ii. 2, 1, 34; iii. 3, 4, 19; iv. 4, 8, 9; xi. 2, 6, 12. the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 13) iii. 5, 1. the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 14) iii. 11, 4; v. 11, 2; 17, 1; vi. 8, 1. and occasionally in the Aitareya, 15) viii. 7. the Kaus2i1taki, 16) xxvi. 4. and the S2ad2vim2s4a 17) i. 6. Bra1hman2as, as well as the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad. 18) i. 1 et seq. In the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 he is not mentioned, according to Geldner, 19) Vedische Studien, 3, 146. but only his father Arun2a; his name does not occur, according to Weber, 20) Indian Literature, 69. But cf. xxiii. 1, 5. in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, but in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 21) vii. 8. Cf. viii. 6. he is, as A1run2i, known as a contemporary of Divoda1sa Bhaimaseni, and in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 22) i. 42, 1. he is mentioned as serving Va1sis2t2ha Caikita1neya. In the Taittiri1ya tradition he seldom appears. There is an allusion in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 23) vii. 2, 2, 1 (a late passage). to Kusurubinda Audda1laki, and according to the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 24) iii. 11, 8, 1 et seq. Naciketas was a son of Va1jas4ravasa Gautama, who is made out to be Udda1laka by Sa1yan2a. 25) On Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. Cf. Ka1t2haka Upanis2ad, i. 11. But the episode of Naciketas, being somewhat unreal, cannot be regarded as of historical value in proving relationship. Arun2a is known to the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. A real son of Udda1laka was the famous S4vetaketu, who is expressly reported by A1pastamba 26) See Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xxxviii; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 39. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170, n.; 2, 201, 202; Oldenberg, Buddha, 396, n.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xl., xli. to have been in his time an Avara or later authority, a statement of importance for the date of A1run2i.

उद्दालकायन
उद्दालकायन
 is mentioned as a pupil of Ja1ba1la1yana in the second Vam2s4a (list of teachers) contained in the Ka1n2va recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (iv. 6, 2).

उद्र
उद्र
 is the name of an animal occurring only in the list of sacrificial victims at the As4vamedha given in the Sam2hita1s of the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 20, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 18; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 37. According to Mahi1dhara 2) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. it was a crab; but as the commentary on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) Loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95, 96; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 247. Udrin occurs in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 5. calls it a watercat, there can be no doubt that it was an otter.

उद्धि
उद्धि
 1) Av. viii. 8, 22; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 2, 2, 2; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 3, 8. denotes some part of a chariot, probably the seat, 2) So Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 506; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 149. but, according to Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the frame resting on the axle.

उपकेतु
उप-केतु
 is the name of a man mentioned in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 (xiii. 1).

उपकोसलकामलायन
उप-कोसल कामलायन
 is mentioned as a teacher and a pupil of Satyaka1ma Ja1ba1la in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (iv. 10, 1; 14, 1). 

उपक्वस
उप-क्वस
 is the name in the Atharvaveda (vi. 50, 2) of a noxious insect injurious to seed. Sa1yan2a, however, reads the word as a plural adjective (a-pakvasah2 = a-dagda1h2), but the Paippala1da recension supports the form upakvasah2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 237; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 486; Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 318.

उपगुसौश्रवस
उप-गु सौश्रवस
 is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiv. 6, 8) as Purohita of Kutsa Aurava, by whom he was murdered because of his paying homage to Indra. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 268; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 57.

उपचित्
उप-चित्
 occurs in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xii. 97. as the name of a disease, which Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders as ‘swelling,’ and which Bloomfield 3) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1887, xviii. identifies with Apacit.

उपजिह्विका
उप-जिह्विका, उप-जीका, उप-दीका
 are all forms of one word denoting a species of ant. 1) Upajihvika1 is the form in Rv. viii. 102, 21; upaji1ka1 in Av. ii. 3, 4; vi. 100, 2; but upaci1ka1 in both passages in the Paippala1da recension; upadi1ka1 in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 3, 4; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, v. 1, 4; 10, 9; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 1, 8. To these ants is attributed in the Atharvaveda 2) vi. 100, 2. Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 7, 482 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 511; Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 41, 354; Bergaigne and Henry, Manuel Ve4dique, 153. the power of penetrating to water which possesses curative properties. They were accordingly used in all sorts of spells against poisoning. The belief in their healing qualities was no doubt due to the well-known properties of the earth of ant-heaps which contains their water.

उपधान
उप-धान
 denotes the ‘cushion’ of a seat (A1sandi1) in the Atharvaveda (xiv. 2, 65). It corresponds to the Upabarhan2a of other texts. 

उपधि
उप-धि
 occurs once each in the Rigveda 1) ii. 39, 4. and the Atharvaveda, 2) vi. 70, 3. in conjunction with Pradhi, denoting part of the wheel of a chariot. It is impossible to decide exactly what part is meant. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 248 (ignoring the Atharvaveda passage). and Bloomfield, 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 493. agree in thinking that the word denotes the spokes collectively. Whitney, 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 334. considering this improbable, prefers to see in it the designation of a solid wheel, Pradhi being presumably the rim and Upadhi the rest. Other possibilities 7) Bloomfield, loc. cit. are that the Upadhi is a rim beneath the felly, or the felly itself as compared with the tire (ordinarily Pavi).

उपनिषद्
उप-निषद्
 in the Bra1hman2as 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 3, 5, 12; 4, 5, 1; 5, 1, 1; xii. 2, 2, 23, etc.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 1, 10; 13, 4; viii. 8, 4. 5; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 20; iv. 2, 1; v. 5, 3; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 1, 6; 2, 5; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, ii. 1, etc. normally denotes the ‘secret sense’ of some word or text, sometimes the ‘secret rule’ of the mendicant. But in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 2) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11. it is already used in the plural as the designation of a class of writings, no doubt actually existing and similar to the Upanis2ads in the nature of their subject-matter and its treatment. Similarly the sections of the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad end with the words ity upanis2ad. The Aitareya A1ran2yaka 3) iii. 1, 1. commences its third part with the title ‘The Upanis2ad of the Sam2hita1,’ and the title occurs also in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka. 4) vii. 2. Cf. Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, i. 3, 1. The exact primary sense of the expression is doubtful. The natural derivation, adopted by Max Mu7ller 5) Sacred Books of the East, 1, xxxiii et seq. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 204. and usual ever since, makes the word mean firstly a session of pupils, hence secret doctrine, and secondly the title of a work on secret doctrine. Oldenberg, 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 50, 457; 54, 70; Die Literatur des alten Indien, 72. however, traces the use of the word to the earlier sense of ‘worship’ (cf. upa1sana). Deussen 7) Philosophy of the Upanis2ads, 16 et seq. considers the original sense to have been ‘secret word,’ next ‘secret text,’ and then ‘secret import,’ but this order of meaning is improbable. Hopkins 8) Religions of India, 218. suggests that Upanis2ad denotes a subsidiary treatise, but this sense does not account naturally for the common use as ‘secret meaning,’ which is far more frequent than any other.

उपपति
उप-पति,
 ‘the gallant,’ is mentioned with the Ja1ra, ‘lover,’ in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xxx. 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 4, 1. as a victim in the human sacrifice (purus2amedha).

उपबर्हण
उप-बर्हण
 denotes a ‘pillow’ or ‘cushion,’ especially of a seat (a1sandi1), occurring in the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 7. the Atharvaveda, 2) ix. 5, 28; xii. 2, 19. 20; xv. 3, 7. and the Bra1hman2as. 3) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 12; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 8, 4, 10; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 6, 10; 6, 8, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 4, etc. The feminine Upabarhan2i1 is found in the Rigveda with the same sense, but used metaphorically of the earth.

उपमन्थनी
उप-मन्थनी
 is used in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) vi. 3, 13. to denote ‘churning sticks.’ In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 2) xxx. 12; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 8, 1. the ‘churner’ (upamanthitr2) is included in the list of victims at the human sacrifice (purus2amedha), and the verb upa-manth is often used of churning or mixing fluids. 3) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 8, 4. 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 1, 6; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 2, 4.

उपमन्यु
उप-मन्यु
 is, according to Ludwig, 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 113. the name of a person in the Rigveda, 2) i. 102. 9. but is more probably explained by Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. as a mere epithet. 

उपमश्रवस्
उपम-श्रवस्
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 33, 6. 7. as a son of Kurus4ravan2a, and grandson of Medha1tithi. The exact force of the reference to him in however, uncertain. According to the Br2haddevata1, 2) vii. 35. 36, with Macdonell's notes. followed by Ludwig, 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. and by Lanman, 4) Sanskrit reader, 386, 389. the poet in the hymn consoles Upamas4ravas for the death of his grandfather, Medha1tithi. Geldner, 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 150, n. on the other hand, thinks that the poet, who was Kavas2a Ailu1s2a, was ill-treated by his patron's son, Upamas4ravas, and cast into a ditch or well, where he uttered his complaint and appeal for mercy. But of this there is no adequate evidence, and the tradition of the Br2haddevata1 seems sound.

उपमित्
उप-मित्
 occurs twice in the Rigveda, 1) i. 59, 1; iv. 5, 1. and once in the Atharvaveda, 2) ix. 3, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 596; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 525. as the designation of some part of a house. The passages in the Rigveda leave little doubt that the word means an upright pillar. As it is, in the Atharvaveda, coupled with Parimit and Pratimit, the conclusion is natural that the latter word denotes the beams supporting the Upamit, presumably by leaning against it at an angle, while Parimit denotes the beams connecting the Upamits horizontally. These interpretations, however, can only be conjectural. See also Gr2ha.

उपर
उपर,
 which, according to Pischel, 1) Vedische Studien, 1, 109. This is the sense of the form upala (Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxv. 8, etc.). means ‘stone’ in general, is the technical name of the stone on which the Soma plant was laid in order to be pounded for the extraction of the juice by other stones (adri, gra1van). The word is rare, occurring only thrice in the Rigveda, 2) i. 79, 3; x. 94, 5; 175, 3. and once in the Atharvaveda. 3) vi. 49, 3. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 154; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 317; Von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 414. 

उपलप्रक्षिणी
उपल-प्रक्षिणी
 occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) ix. 112, 3. where it designates the occupation of a woman, as opposed to that of her son, who is a poet (ka1ru), and to that of his father, who is a physician (bhis2aj). Ya1ska 2) Nirukta, vi. 5. renders the word by ‘maker of groats’ (saktu-ka1rika1), and Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Grassmann, 4) Ibid., s.v., ‘fitting the upper (to the lower) millstone.’ Zimmer, 5) Altindisches Leben, 269. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedaschrestomathie, s.v., who, taking pr2c in the sense of ‘fill,’ explains the compound as ‘filling the upper millstone,’ an interpretation which as it stands is unintelligible. as well as others, connect it with the operation of grinding corn. Pischel, 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 308-310. however, who points out that corn was not ground between two stones, but beaten on a stone with a pestle (dr2s2ad), considers that Upala-praks2in2i1 denotes a woman that assisted at the crushing of Soma (cf. Upara). Von Schroeder, 7) Mysterium und Mimus, 412 et seq. Von Schroeder does not accept the view that the mother of the singer is alluded to; but it seems impossible to draw any other conclusion from the language of the passage, and his own explanation of the word as referring to a corn-mother is very improbable; cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 204. who more correctly points out that there is no objection to regarding upala as the mortar in which the corn was placed and then beaten with the pestle, renders the word literally as ‘one who fills the (lower) stone (with corn).’

उपला
उपला
 in the Bra1hman2as 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 1, 22; ii. 1, 14, 17; ii. 2, 2, 1, etc. Cf. Von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 413, n. 3. may denote the upper and smaller ‘stone,’ which was used as a pestle with the Dr2s2ad as the mortar, whereas Upara in the Sam2hita1s denotes rather the mortar, and Dr2s2ad the pestle. But see Dr2s2ad.

उपवाक
उप-वाक
 occurs in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xix. 22; 90; xxi. 30 (as ‘healing’). and the Bra1hman2as 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 7, 1, 3; 2, 9, etc. as a description of a species of grain, the Wrightia antidysenterica, known later as Indra-yava. The commentator Mahi1dhara 3) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 22. simply glosses it with the more general term Yava. According to the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, it formed the essential element of gruel (karambha), and Upava1ka groats (saktavah2) are mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 4) xii. 9, 1, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 240, 270.

उपवेशि
उप-वेशि
 is mentioned as a pupil of Kus4ri in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 5, 3, in both recensions). See also Aupaves4i.

उपश्री
उप-श्री, उप-श्रय,
 are two readings of the same term. The former is found in one recension of the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, 1) i. 5. while the latter is probably the reading of the other recension of the Upanis2ad, 2) See Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 20, n. 3. and certainly the reading in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 3) xv. 3, 8. Cf. Whitney's note in his Translation. though the text has apas4rayah2, which is accepted as possible by Roth. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and still followed by Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. In both cases the term clearly means something connected with a couch (A1sandi1 in the Atharvaveda, Paryan3ka in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad). Aufrecht, 5) Indische Studien, 1, 131. Roth, 6) S.v. apas4raya. and Max Mu7ller 7) Sacred Books af the East, 1, 278. render it as ‘coverlet’ or ‘cushion,’ but Whitney 8) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 777. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 402; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. seems evidently right in holding that it must mean a ‘support’ or something similar.

उपस्तरण
उप-स्तरण
 denotes in the description of the couch (Paryan3ka) in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 1) i. 5. a ‘coverlet,’ and has this sense, used metaphorically, in the Rigveda 2) ix. 69, 5. also. In the Atharvaveda 3) v. 19, 12. it seems to have the same meaning. Whitney, 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 254. however, renders it ‘couch,’ though he translates 5) Ibid., 776. the parallel word A1staran2a in another passage 6) xv. 3, 7. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 403; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. by ‘cushion.’ 

उपस्ति
उप-स्ति
 denotes both in the Rigveda 1) x. 97, 23 (= Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 101; Av. vi. 15, 1). and the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 5, 6. a ‘dependent,’ just as later in the Epic 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 92. the subordination of the Vais4ya to the two superior castes is expressed by the verb upa-stha1, ‘stand under,’ ‘support.’ The word also appears, with the same sense, in the form of Sti, but only in the Rigveda. 4) vii. 19, 11; x. 148, 4; sti-pa, vii. 66, 3; x. 69, 4. The exact nature of the dependence connoted by the term is quite uncertain. Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 184, 185. conjectures that the ‘dependents’ were the members of defeated Aryan tribes who became clients of the king, as among the Greeks, Romans, and Germans, the term possibly including persons who had lost their freedom through dicing. 6) Rv. x. 34. The evidence of the Atharvaveda 7) Av. iii. 5, 6. 7. shows that among the Upastis were included the chariot-makers (ratha-ka1ra), the smiths (taks2an), and the charioteers (su1ta), and troop-leaders (gra1ma-n2i1), while the Rigveda passages negative the possibility of the ‘subjects’ (sti) being the whole people. It is therefore fair to assume that they were the clients proper of the king, not servile, but attached in a special relation to him as opposed to the ordinary population. They may well have included among them not only the classes suggested by Zimmer, but also higher elements, such as refugees from other clans, as well as ambitious men who sought advancement in the royal service. Indeed, the Su1ta and the Gra1man2i1 were, as such, officers of the king's household--kingmakers, not themselves kings, as they are described in the Atharvaveda. 8) iii. 5, 7. The use of the word in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 9) vii. 2, 5, 4. Cf. vi. 5, 8, 2. the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 10) iii. 3, 5, 4. and the Ka1t2haka, 11) xxxi. 9. is purely metaphorical, as well as in the one passage of the Rigveda in which it occurs. In the Paippala1da recension of the Atharvaveda, 12) iii. 5, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 246; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 92; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 196 et seq. Vais4ya, S4u1dra, and A1rya are referred to as Upastis, perhaps in the general sense of ‘subject.’ 

उपस्तुत
उप-स्तुत
 is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 36, 10. 17; 112, 15; viii. 5, 25; x. 115, 8. always as a sage of old, and usually in connexion with Kan2va, who was aided or favoured by Agni, the As4vins, and other gods. The Upastutas, sons of Vr2s2t2ihavya, 2) x. 115, 9. are mentioned as singers 3) viii. 103, 8; x. 115, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 152, 153.

उपह्वर
उप-ह्वर
 denotes, in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 87, 2. according to Geldner, 2) Vedische Studien, 3, 40. the body of a chariot (upa-stha).

उपानस
उपानस
 is in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 14, 2. opposed to Aks2a, and must mean something like ‘the body of the wagon,’ though Sa1yan2a suggests that it signifies either a ‘granary’ or a ‘wagon full of grain.’ In the Rigveda, 2) x. 105, 4. where the word occurs only once, its sense is doubtful. Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 197. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 301; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 56. explains the form which occurs there not as an adjective, but as an infinitive.

उपानह्
उपा-नह्
 is the regular word for a ‘sandal’ or ‘shoe’ from the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 4, 4, 4; 6, 6, 1, etc. onwards. Boarskin is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) v. 4, 3, 19. as a material of which shoes were made. The combination ‘staff and sandals’ (dan2d2opa1naha) occurs as early as the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a. 3) iii. 3.

उपाविजानश्रुतेय
उपावि जान-श्रुतेय
 is mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (i. 25, 15) as an authority on the Upasads (a kind of Soma ceremony).

उपोदितिगौपालेय
उपोदिति गौपालेय
 is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xii. 13, 11) as a seer of Sa1mans.

उभयादन्त्
उभया-दन्त्,
 ‘having incisors in both jaws,’ is an expression employed to distinguish, among domestic animals, the horse, the ass, etc., from the goat, the sheep, and cattle. The distinction occurs in a late hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 90, 10. and is several times alluded to in the later Sam2hita1s 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 6, 3; v. 1, 2, 6; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 8, 1. and the Bra1hman2as. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 30 (ubhayato-dant). In one passage of the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 4) ii. 2, 6, 3. man is classed with the horse as ubhaya1-dant. The opposite is anyato-dant, ‘having incisors in one jaw only,’ a term regularly applied to cattle, 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 1, 5; v. 1, 2, 6; 5, 1, 3. the eight incisors of which are, in fact, limited to the lower jaw. The ass is styled ubhaya1-dant in the Atharvaveda. 6) v. 31, 3. In one passage of the Atharvaveda, 7) v. 19, 2. however, the epithet is applied to a ram; but the sense here is that a marvel occurs, just as in the Rigveda 8) viii. 18, 17. a ram destroys a lioness. Bloomfield 9) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 434. suggests in the Atharvaveda passage another reading which would mean ‘horse.’ A parallel division of animals is that of the Taittiri1ya 10) iv. 3, 10, 2. and Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1s 11) xiv. 30. into ‘whole-hoofed’ (eka-s4apha) and ‘small’ (ks2udra). Zimmer 12) Altindisches Leben, 74-76. seeks to show from the Greek  13) Aristotle, Hist. An., ii. 1, 8. and the Latin ambidens 14) Festus apud Paulum Diaconum Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 58. that the Indo-European was familiar with the division of the five sacrificial animals into the two classes of man and horse on the one hand, and cattle, sheep, and goats on the other. But this supposition is not necessary.

उरा
उरा
 as a name for ‘sheep’ is confined to the Rigveda. 1) viii. 34, 3. It is curious that in one of its two occurrences the wolf should be referred to as terrifying sheep, and that the epithet of the wolf, ura1-mathi, ‘killing sheep,’ should occur once in the Rigveda, 2) viii. 66, 8. Cf. Nirukta, v. 21. both references being in one book of the Sam2hita1, a fact which suggests a dialectical origin of the word ura1. See also Avi. 

उरुकक्ष
उरु-कक्ष
 occurs in only one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 45, 31. where the sense of the word is much disputed. The reading of the text is uruh2 kaks2o na ga1n3gyah2, which may refer to a man, Urukaks2a, ‘dwelling on the Ganges,’ 2) Grassmann; St. Petersburg Dictionary. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 291. or to a man, son of Gan3ga1, or to a wood so called, 3) Ludwig's translation (der wald Urukaks2a, or das weite dickicht). or may simply denote the ‘broad thicket on the Ganges.’ 4) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 28, n. 5; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 396.

उरुक्षय
उरु-क्षय
 --A family of Uruks2ayas, singers and worshippers of Agni, is referred to in one hymn of the Rigveda (x. 118, 8. 9). Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 167.

उरुञ्जिरा
उरुञ्जिरा
 is given in the Nirukta (ix. 26) as one of the names of the river Vipa1s4 (now Bea7s).

उर्वरा
उर्वरा
 is with Ks2etra the regular expression, from the Rigveda 1) i. 127, 6; iv. 41, 6; v. 33, 4; vi. 25, 4; x. 30, 3; 142, 3, etc.; Av. x. 6, 33; 10, 8; xiv. 2, 14, etc. onwards, denoting a piece of ‘ploughland’ (). Fertile (apnasvati1) fields 2) Rv. i. 127, 6. are spoken of as well as waste fields (a1rtana1). 3) Ibid. Intensive cultivation by means of irrigation is clearly referred to both in the Rigveda 4) vii. 49, 2. and in the Atharvaveda, 5) i. 6, 4; xix. 2, 2. while allusion is also made to the use of manure. 6) Av. iii. 14, 3, 4; xix. 31, 3. The fields (ks2etra) were carefully measured according to the Rigveda. 7) i. 110, 5. This fact points clearly to individual ownership in land for the plough, a conclusion supported by the reference of Apa1la1, in a hymn of the Rigveda, 8) viii. 91, 5. to her father's field (urvara1), which is put on the same level as his head of hair as a personal possession. Consistent with this are the epithets ‘winning fields’ (urvara1-sa1, urvara1-jit, ks2etra-sa1), 9) Rv. iv. 38, 1, and vi. 20, 1; ii. 21, 1; iv. 38, 1. while ‘lord of fields’ used of a god 10) viii. 21, 3. Cf. Ks2etra. is presumably a transfer of a human epithet (urvara1-pati). Moreover, fields are spoken of in the same connexion as children, 11) Rv. iv. 41, 6, etc. and the conquest of fields (ks2etra1n2i sam2-ji) is often referred to in the Sam2hita1s. 12) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 8, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, v. 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 12, 3. Very probably, as suggested by Pischel, 13) Vedische Studien, 2, 204-207. the ploughland was bounded by grass land (perhaps denoted by Khila, Khilya) which in all likelihood would be joint property on the analogy of property elsewhere. There is no trace in Vedic literature of communal property in the sense of ownership by a community of any sort, 14) Cf. Baden Powell, Indian Village Community (1899); Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; Mrs. Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, 860. nor is there mention of communal cultivation. Individual property in land seems also presumed later on. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 15) vii. 24, 2. the things given as examples of wealth include fields and houses (a1yatana1ni). The Greek evidence 16) Cf. Diodorus, ii. 40; Arrian, Indica, 11; Strabo, p. 703; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 87 et seq. Cf. ibid., 20, 22, 23. also points to individual ownership. The precise nature of the ownership is of course not determined by the expression ‘individual ownership.’ The legal relationship of the head of a family and its members is nowhere explained, and can only be conjectured (see Pitr2). Very often a family may have lived together with undivided shares in the land. The rules about the inheritance of landed property do not occur before the Su1tras. 17) Cf. Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xviii. 5 et seq.; Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, ii. 2, 3; A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, ii. 6, 14. Of course, the rules probably go back to the earlier period, but how far it is impossible to say. With the settlement of the country, however, inheritance of land and its partition must have become inevitable. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 18) xiii. 6, 2, 18; 7, 1, 13. 15. the giving of land as a fee to priests is mentioned, but with reproof: land was no doubt even then a very special kind of property, not lightly to be given away or parted with. 19) It is significant that in the famous episode (Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 9, 4) of Manu's division of his property, from which Na1bha1nedis2t2ha was excluded, this exclusion is made good by the son's obtaining cattle (pas4avah2). It is clear that cattle, not land, was the real foundation of wealth, just as in Ireland, Italy (cf. pecunia), Greece, etc. Cattle could be, and were, used individually, but land was not open to a man's free disposal; no doubt, at any rate, the consent of the family or the community might be required, but we are reduced to reliance on analogy in view of the silence of the texts. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 289; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 94-96; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 48 et seq. On the relation of the owners of land to the king and others see Gra1ma; on its cultivation see Kr2s2i.

उर्वारू
उर्वारू,
 f., Urva1ruka, n., ‘cucumber.’ The former 1) Av. vi. 14, 2. of these words denotes the plant, the latter 2) Rv. vii. 59, 12 = Av. xiv. 1, 17 = Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 4 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 6, 2 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 60. the fruit, but both are very rare. The passages all seem to refer to the fact that the stem of the plant becomes loosened when the fruit is ripe. 3) Sa1yan2a on Av. vi. 14, 2. The fruit is also called Urva1ru in a Bra1hman2a. 4) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 2. 19. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 242.

उल
उल
 is the name of some unknown wild animal, perhaps, as Whitney 1) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 669. suggests, the ‘jackal.’ It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 2) xii. 1, 49. and later Sam2hita1s, 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 12, 1 (as u1la); Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 13, 12; 14, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 31.

उलप
उलप
 1) x. 142, 3. is the name of a species of grass referred to in the Rigveda and the later Sam2hita1s. 2) Av. vii. 66, 1. Adjectives derived from the word are ulapya (Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 45, etc.) and upolapa (Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 7, 2).

उलुक्यजानश्रुतेय
उलुक्य जान-श्रुतेय
 is mentioned as a teacher in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (i. 6, 3). 

उलूक
उलूक
 is the ordinary word for ‘owl’ from the Rigveda 1) x. 165, 4. onwards. The bird was noted for its cry, 2) Rv. loc. cit. and was deemed the harbinger of ill-fortune (nairr2ta). 3) Av. vi. 19, 2: Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 18, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 38. Owls were offered at the horse sacrifice to the forest trees, 4) Va1jasaneyi Samhita1, xxiv. 23; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14. 4. no doubt because they roosted there.

उलूखल
उलूखल
 is the regular expression for ‘mortar’ from the Rigveda 1) i. 28, 6; Av. x. 9, 26; xi. 3, 3; xii. 3, 13: Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 8, 7; vii. 2, 1, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 6, etc. onwards, occurring frequently also in the compound 2) Av. ix. 6, 15; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 1, 22 Ulu1kala-musala, ‘mortar and pestle.’ The exact construction of the vessel is quite unkown till we reach the Su1tra period.

उल्का
उल्का
 regularly denotes a meteor from the Rigveda 1) iv. 4, 2; x. 68, 4; Av. xix. 9, 8, S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 8, etc. onwards. In the Bra1hman2as 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 19. it also signifies a ‘firebrand.’ The much rarer form Ulkus2i1 3) As ‘meteor,’ Av. v. 17, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 2, 7, 21; as ‘firebrand,’ ibid., iii. 9, 2, 9. has both senses.

उल्मुक
उल्मुक
 is the common word in the Bra1hman2as 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 11; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 2, 1; ii. 1, 4, 28, etc.; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 76 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 239) for ‘firebrand,’ from which a coal (an3ga1ra) 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 4, 3, 3; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 61, 1 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 342). could be taken.

उल्मुकवक्षयण
उल्मुकवक्षयण
 is an expression that occurs several times in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) iv. 6. 8, 7; v. 2, 4, 15; xi. 6, 3, 3; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 76. Cf. Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. signifying a ‘means of extinguishing (ava-ks2ayan2a) a firebrand,’ or possibly more precisely ‘tongs.’ Compare An3ga1ra1vaks2ayan2a. 

उशनस्काव्य
उशनस् काव्य
 is an ancient seer, already a half-mythical figure in the Rigveda, 1) i. 51, 10; 83. 5; 121, 12; iv. 16, 2; vi. 20, 11; viii. 23, 17; ix. 87, 3; 97, 7; x. 40, 7; probably also i. 130, 9; v. 31, 8; 34. 2; viii. 7, 26; x. 22, 6. Also in Av. iv. 29, 6. where he is often mentioned, especially as associated with Kutsa and Indra. Later on 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 8, 5: Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vii. 5, 20; S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xiv. 27, 1. he becomes the Purohita of the Asuras in their contests with the gods. A variant of his name is Kavi Us4anas. 3) Rv. iv. 26, 1. He appears in the Bra1hman2as as a teacher also. 4) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 12, 5; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. ii. 7. 2, 6. Cf.

उशना
उशना
 occurs in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (iii. 4, 3, 13; iv. 2, 5, 15) as the name of a plant from which Soma was prepared.

उशीनर
उशीनर
 --In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a1 1) viii. 14. the Kuru-Pan5ca1las are mentioned as dwelling together in the ‘Middle Country’ with the Vas4as and the Us4i1naras. In the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 2) iv. 1. See Keith S4a1n3kha1yana A1ranyaka, 36. also the Us4i1naras are associated with the Kuru-Pan5ca1las and Vas4as, but in the Gopatha Bra1hman2a 3) ii 9. the Us4i1naras and Vas4as are regarded as northerners. In the Rigveda 4) x. 59, 10. the people is alluded to in one passage by reference to their queen, Us4i1nara1n2i1. Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 130. thinks that the Us4i1naras earlier lived farther to the north-west, but for this there is no clear evidence. His theory is based merely on the fact that the Anukraman2i1 (Index) of the Rigveda ascribes one hymn 6) Rv. x. 179. to S4ibi Aus4i1nara, and that the S4ibis were known to Alexander's followers as , 7) Diodorus, xvii. 19. living between the Indus and the Akesines (Chenab). But this is in no way conclusive, as the S4ibis, at any rate in Epic times, 8) See Pargiter's map. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908. p. 322. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 213, 419; Hultzsch Indian Antiquary, 34, 179. occupied the land to the north of Kuruks2etra, and there is no reason whatever to show that in the Vedic period the Us4i1naras were farther west than the ‘Middle Country.’ 

उष
उष,
 ‘salt ground,’ occurs as a variant of U1s2a in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (i. 6, 3).

उषस्तचाक्रायण
उषस्त चाक्रायण
 is mentioned as a teacher in the Br2hada1ran2yaka (iii. 5, 1) and Cha1ndogya (i. 10, 1; 11, 1) Upanis2ads, the name in the latter work appearing as Us2asti.

उष्टि
उष्टि, उष्ट्र
 --Both of these words, of which the former is quite rare, 1) Perhaps in Rv. x. 106, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 21, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 2. must have the same sense. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Aufrecht 3) Cited in Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 468. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 224. hold that in the Rigveda 4) i. 138, 2; viii. 5, 37; 6, 48; 46, 22. 31; Av. xx. 127, 2; 132, 13; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 50. and the Bra1hman2as 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1, 2, 3, 9, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 8. the sense is ‘humped bull’ or ‘buffalo,’ but the former thinks that in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 6) xxiv. 28. 39. the sense is doubtful, and ‘camel’ may be meant. Hopkins 7) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 83. is decidedly of opinion that the sense in every case is ‘camel.’ The animal was used as a beast of burden yoked in fours. 8) Av. xx. 127, 2; Rv. viii. 6, 48.

उष्णीष
उष्णीष
 denotes the ‘turban’ worn by Vedic Indians, men and women 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 1; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 2, 3; iv. 5, 2, 7 (used at the sacrifice to wrap the embryo in); xiv. 2, 1, 8 (Indra1n2i1's Us2n2i1s2a), etc.; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 10. alike. The Vra1tya's turban is expressly referred to in the Atharvaveda 2) xv. 2, 1. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) xvii. 1, 14. Cf. xvi. 6, 13. A turban was also worn at the Va1japeya 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 5, 23. and the Ra1jasu1ya 5) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 3. ceremonies by the king as a token of his position.

उष्यल
उष्यल
 occurs once in the description of the couch or the bridal car in the Atharvaveda, 1) xiv. 1, 60. where it seems to mean the four ‘frame-pieces.’ The form is doubtful: us2pala is possible. 2) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 385. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155; Whitney, op. cit., 752. 

उस्र
उस्र,
 m.; Usra1, f.; Usrika, m.; Usriya, m.; Usriya1, f. All these words denote a ‘bull’ or a ‘cow,’ occurring frequently in the Rigveda, 1) Usra, Rv. vi. 12, 4; usra1, i. 3, 8; viii. 75, 8; 96, 8; ix. 58, 2, etc.; usrika, i. 190, 5; usriya, v. 58, 6 (with vr2s2abhah2); ix. 74. 3; usriya1, i. 153, 4; 180, 3; ii. 40, 2, etc. In ix. 70, 6, usriya is applied to a calf; and in ix. 68, 1; 93, 2, usriya1 means ‘milk.’ and sometimes later, 2 Usrau dhu1rs2a1hau, Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 33; usra1, Av. xii. 3, 37; usriya, Av. i. 12, 1; usriya1, Av. ix. 4, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxv. 2. 3. In Av. v. 20, 1; 28, 3, it means ‘cowhide,’ or perhaps in v. 28, 3, ‘milk.’ but usually with some reference to the morning light. In some passages the sense is doubtful. See Go. U1.

ऊर्जयन्तौपमन्यव
ऊर्जयन्त् औपमन्यव
 is mentioned in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. as a pupil of Bha1numant Aupamanyava.

ऊर्जयन्ती
ऊर्जयन्ती
 is regarded by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152. in one passage of the Rigveda 2) ii. 13, 8. as the name of a fort, the stronghold of Na1rmara. The verse is, however, quite unintelligible. 3) Sa1yan2a makes Urjayanti1 a Pis4a1ci1; Grassmann, the sun; Roth, s.v. u1rjay, takes it adjectivally. Cf. Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 199.

ऊर्जव्य
ऊर्जव्य,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) v. 41, 20. is taken by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155. to be the name of a sacrificer. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, regards the word as an adjective meaning ‘rich in strength,’ and this is the more probable interpretation.

ऊर्णनाभी
ऊर्ण-नाभी,
 1) U1rn2a-na1bhi (‘having wool in its navel’), Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 5; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 23; u1rn2a-va1bhi1 (‘wool-spinner’), Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 5, 1, 23; u1rn2a1-vant (‘possessing wool’), Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xix. 3 (in a Mantra). U1rn2a-va1bhi, U1rn2a1-vant are all names of the spider in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as in allusion to the insect's spinning threads of wool, as it were. 

ऊर्णा
ऊर्णा,
 ‘wool,’ is very frequently mentioned from the Rigveda 1) iv. 22, 2; v. 52, 9; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 5, 1, 13: 7, 2, 10, etc.; u1rn2a1yu, ‘woolly,’ Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 50; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xii. 11, 10. onwards. The Parus2n2i1 country was famous for its wool, 2) Rv., loc. cit.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 210. But cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 315. like Gandha1ra 3) Rv. i. 126, 7. for its sheep. The term for the separate tufts was parvan 4) Rv. iv. 22, 10. or parus. 5) Rv. ix. 15, 6. ‘Soft as wool’ (u1rn2a-mradas) 6) Rv. v. 5, 4; x. 18, 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 2: iv. 10; xxi. 33, etc. is not a rare epithet. The sheep is called ‘woolly’ (u1rn2a1vati1). 7) Rv. viii. 56, 3. ‘Woollen thread’ (u1rn2a1-su1tra) is repeatedly referred to in the later Sam2hita1s 8) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 9; Ka1t2haka Samhita1, xxxviii. 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 80, etc. Cf. u1rn2a1-stuka1, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 28; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 3. and the Bra1hman2as. 9) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 7, 2, 11, etc. The word u1rn2a1 was not restricted to the sense of sheep's wool, 10) Cf. anaid2aki1r u1rn2a1h2 (‘wool not coming from the ed2aha,’ a species of sheep) in S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5 2, 15. but might denote goat's hair also. 11) Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 83, n.

ऊर्णावती
ऊर्णा-वती
 --In the hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 75. 8. which celebrates the rivers Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3. 200. finds a reference to an affluent of the Indus called U1rn2a1vati1. This interpretation, however, seems certainly wrong. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders the word merely as ‘woolly,’ and Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben. 429. rejects Ludwig's explanation on the ground that it throws the structure of the hymn into confusion. Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 210. makes the word an epithet of the Indus, ‘rich in sheep.’

ऊर्दर
ऊर्दर
 --This word occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) ii. 14, 11. when reference is made to filling Indra with Soma as one fills an U1rdara with grain (Yava). Sa1yan2a renders it grana1ry, but Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 238. seem more correct in simply making it a measure for holding grain, or ‘garner.’

1. R2ks2a, ‘bear,’ is found only once in the Rigveda, 1) v. 56, 3. and seldom later, 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 17; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 36; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 184. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81. the animal having evidently been scarce in the regions occupied by the Vedic Indians. Not more frequent 3) Rv. i. 24, 10; Satapatha Bra1hman2a. ii. 1, 2, 4; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 11, 2. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 422. is the use of the word in the plural to denote the ‘seven bears,’ later called the ‘seven R2s2is,’ 4) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 144 (D). the constellation of the ‘Great Bear’ (, ursa).

ऋक्ष
2. R2ks2a is the name of a patron mentioned in one verse of a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 68, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. his son being referred to in the next verse as A1rks2a.

ऋक्षाका
ऋक्षाका
 is a word occurring once in an obscure passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) xviii. 2, 31. The sense is quite unknown. Weber 2) Festgruss an Roth, 138, n. 2; Berlin Catalogue, 2, 59, 11.; Proccedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 856. thinks it refers to the ‘milky way,’ but his view rests on no evidence. Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 840. despairs of the passage. 

ऋक्षीका
ऋक्षीका,
 a word found in the Atharvaveda, 1) xii. 1, 49. the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 2) xxx. 8. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) xiii. 2, 4, 2. 4. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 307. appears to denote a demon. Harisva1min, however, in his commentary on the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, connects the word with R2ks2a, as meaning ‘bear.’

ऋग्वेद
ऋग्-वेद,
 the formal name of the collection of R2cs, first appears in the Bra1hman2as, 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 32, and implied in Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 12, 9, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 5, 4, 6; 8, 3; xii. 3, 4, 9. and thereafter frequently in the A1ran2yakas 2) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 3. 5; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 3. 8. and Upanis2ads. 3) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 5, 12; ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6; 5, 11; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 3, 7; iii. 1, 2. 3; 15, 7; vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1.

ऋजिश्वन्
ऋजिश्वन्
 is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 51, 5; 53, 8; 101, 1; vi. 20, 7; viii. 49, 10; x. 99, 11; 138, 3. but always in a vague manner, as if very ancient. He assists Indra in fights against demoniac figures like Pipru and the dusky brood (kr2s2n2a-garbha1h2). According to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 143, 149. he was called Aus4ija's son, 3) Rv. x. 99, 11. Cf. Aus4ija. but this is doubtful. He is twice 4) Rv. iv. 16, 13; v. 29, 11. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 161 (C). clearly called Vaidathina, or descendant of Vidathin.

ऋजूनस्
ऋजूनस्
 is mentioned once only in the Rigveda 1) viii. 52, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. along with six other Soma sacrificers.

ऋज्राश्व
ऋज्राश्व
 appears in the Rigveda 1) i. 100, 16. 17. as one of the Va1rs2a1giras, along with Ambari1s2a, Sura1dhas, Sahadeva, and Bhayama1na, and as apparently victorious in a race. Elsewhere 2) i. 116, 17; 117, 16. 17. in the Rigveda he is celebrated as having been blinded by his father for slaying one hundred rams for a she-wolf, and as having been restored to sight by the As4vins, a legend of quite obscure meaning. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 52.

ऋण
ऋण,
 ‘debt,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda 1) ii. 27, 4, etc., usually in a metaphorical sense. onwards, having apparently been a normal condition among the Vedic Indians. Reference is often made 2) Rv. x. 34, 10; Av. vi. 119, 1. to debts contracted at dicing. To pay off a debt was called r2n2am2 sam2-ni1. 3) Rv. viii. 47, 17 = Av. vi. 46, 3. Allusion is made to debt contracted without intention of payment. 4) Av. vi. 119, 1. The result of non-payment of a debt might be very serious: the dicer might fall into slavery. 5) Rv. x. 34. Cf. Lu7ders, Das Wu1rfelspiel im alten Indien, 61. Debtors, like other malefactors, such as thieves, were frequently bound by their creditors to posts (dru-pada), 6) Rv. x. 34, 4, seems to refer rather to the binding and taking away as a slave, though Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 228, explains it as the binding of a debtor for non-payment, interpreting the obscure verse i. 169, 7, in the same way. But Av. vi. 115, 2, 3, may refer to debt, and if this is the meaning the allusion to binding to a post as a punishment is clear. See, however, Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 528, n. 1; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 364, who interprets the hymn as referring only to sin. Rv. i. 24, 13. 15; Av. vi. 63, 3 = 84, 4; 121, 1 et seq., are general; while Rv. vii. 86, 5; Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, refer to the binding of thieves in the stocks. Cf. Taskara. presumably as a means of putting pressure on them or their friends to pay up the debt. The amount of interest payable is impossible to make out. In one passage of the Rigveda and Atharvaveda 7) Rv. viii. 47, 17 = Av. vi. 46, 3. an eighth (s4apha) and a sixteenth (kala1) are mentioned as paid, but it is quite uncertain whether interest or an instalment of the principal is meant. Presumably the interest would be paid in kind. How far a debt was a heritable interest or obligation does not appear. The Kaus4ika Su1tra 8) xlvi. 36-40. See Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 154; Bloomfield, op. cit., 528. regards three hymns of the Atharvaveda 9) vi. 117-119. The name for unpaid debt is in Av. vi. 117, 1, apamityam aprati1tam. In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 8, 1, kusi1dam aprati1ttam; in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 14, 17, and Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 3, 1, 8, kusi1dam aprati1tam; in the Mantra Bra1hman2a, ii. 3. 20, apradattam. as applicable to the occasion of the payment of a debt after the creditor's decease. For the payment of a debt. by a relation of the debtor the evidence is still less clear. 10) Cf. Rv. iv. 3, 13 (a brother's sin or debt); Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 99, 100. Zimmer 11) Altindisches Leben, 181. This suggestion is ignored by Bloomfield, op. cit., 375, and Whitney, op. cit., 304. thinks that payments of debt were made in the presence of witnesses who could be appealed to in case of dispute. This conclusion is, however, very uncertain, resting solely on a vague verse in the Atharvaveda. 12) vi. 32, 3 = viii. 8, 21. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 14, and see Jn5a1tr2. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 181, 182; 259.

ऋणंचय
ऋणं-चय,
 a prince of the Rus4amas, is celebrated in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) of the Rigveda (v. 30, 12. 14) for his generosity to a poet named Babhru. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 129; Br2hadevata1, ed. Macdonell, 2, 169, 174.

ऋतु
ऋतु,
 ‘season,’ is a term repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda 1) i. 49, 3; 84, 18, etc. onwards, Three seasons of the year are often alluded to, 2) Cf. Rv. i. 164, 2 (tri-na1bhi), 48 (tri1n2i nabhya1ni); also perhaps the R2bhus as the genii of the three seasons and the three dawns. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 133; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 33 et seq.: S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 1, 28, and the ca1turma1sya1ni, or four-monthly sacrifices performed at the beginning of the seasons in the ritual (Weber, Naxatra, 2, 329 et seq.). but the names are not usually specified. In one passage of the Rigveda 3) x. 90, 6. Hillebrandt, op. cit., 2, 35, finds in Rv. v. 14, 4: ix. 91, 6, reference to three seasons in the triad ga1vah2 (? spring), a1pah2 (rains), svar (= gharma), and in the ritual literature (A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 4, 2) in the threefold division into r2ta, gharma, and os2adhi. spring (vasanta), summer (gri1s2ma), and autumn (s4arad) are given. The Rigveda knows also the rainy season (pra1-vr2s2) and the winter (hima1, hemanta). A more usual 4) Av. viii. 2, 22; 9, 15; xiii. 1, 18; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 2, 3; iv. 3, 3, 1. 2; v. 1, 10, 3; 3, 1, 2; 4. 12, 2; 6. 10, 1; 7, 2, 4; vii. 1, 18, 1. 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 7, 3; iii. 4, 8; 13, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, iv. 14; ix. 16; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 10-14; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 5, 11; vi. 2, 2, 3. etc.; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 4, 1; 11, 10, 4, etc. Cf. Rv. i, 164, 13. See also Weber, op. cit., 2, 352. division (not found in the Rigveda) is into five seasons, vasanta, gri1s2ma, vars2a1, s4arad, hemama-sis4ira, but occasionally the five are otherwise divided, vars2a1-s4arad being made one season. 5) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 6, 1, 10. 11. Sometimes six 6) Av. vi. 55, 2; xii. 1, 36; Taitti1ri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 5, 2; 7, 3; 2. 6, 1, etc.; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 7, 3; iii. 11, 12; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 23-28; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 2, 21; ii. 4, 2, 24; xii. 8, 2, 34; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 19, etc. Cf. also Rv. i. 23, 15, as interpreted by Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. indu. seasons are reckoned, hemanta and s4is4ira being divided, so that the six seasons can be made parallel to the twelve months of the year. A still more artificial arrangement 7) Av. vi. 61, 2; viii. 9, 18; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 5, 1, 15; ix. 1, 2, 31; 2, 3, 45; 3, 1, 19; 5, 2, 8; perhaps Av. iv. 11, 9, and of. Rv. i. 164. 1. makes the seasons seven, possibly by reckoning the intercalary month as a season, as Weber and Zimmer 8) Indische Studien, 18, 44; Altindisches Leben, 374. hold, or more probably because of the predilection for the number seven, as Roth 9) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. r2tu. Cf. Hopkins, Religions of India, 18, 33. suggests. Occasionally the word r2tu is applied to the months. 10) Av. xv. 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 11, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 25; xiv. 6. 15. 26. 27; xv. 57, etc. The last season, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 11) i. 5. 3. 13. is hemanta. The growth of the division of the seasons from three to five is rightly explained by Zimmer 12) Op. cit., 373. as indicating the advance of the Vedic Indians towards the east. It is not Rigvedic, but dominates the later Sam2hita1s. Traces of an earlier division of the year into winter and summer do not appear clearly in the Rigveda, where the appropriate words hima1 and sama1 are merely general appellations of the year, and where s4arad 13) Hopkins, American Journal of Philology, 15, 159, 160: Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 232; Bu7hler, Zcitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 41, 28. is commoner than either as a designation of the year, because it denotes the harvest, a time of overwhelming importance to a young agricultural people. The division of the year in one passage of the Atharvaveda 14) viii. 9, 17. Cf. Zimmer, 372. into two periods of six months is merely formal, and in no way an indication of old tradition.

ऋत्विज्
ऋत्व्-इज्
 is the regular term for ‘sacrificial priest,’ covering all the different kinds of priests employed at the sacrifice. It appears certain that all the priests were Bra1hman2as. 1) This is assumed throughout the Vedic texts, and is accompanied by the rule that no Ks2atriya can eat of the sacrificial offering (Cf. Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 26): no doubt because only the Bra1hman2as were sufficiently holy to receive the divine essence of the sacrifice into which, by partaking of it, the deity has entered in part. The number of priests officiating at a sacrifice with different functions was almost certainly seven. The oldest list, occurring in one passage of the Rigveda, 2) ii. 1, 2. Cf. Oldenberg. Rdigion des Veda, 383. enumerates their names as Hotr2, Potr2, Nes2t2r2, Agni1dh, Pras4a1str2, Adhvaryu, Brahman, besides the institutor of the sacrifice. The number of seven probably explains the phrase ‘seven Hotr2s’ occurring so frequently in the Rigveda, and is most likely connected with that of the mythical ‘seven R2s2is.’ It may be compared with the eight of Iran. 3) Darmesteter, Le Zend-Avesta, 1, lxx et seq. The chief of the seven priests was the Hotr2, who was the singer of the hymns, and in the early times their composer also. The Adhvaryu performed the practical work of the sacrifice, and accompanied his performance with muttered formulas of prayer and deprecation of evil. His chief assistance was derived from the Agni1dh, the two performing the smaller sacrifices without other help in practical matters. The Pras4a1str2, Upavaktr2, or Maitra1varun2a, as he was variously called, appeared only in the greater sacrifices as giving instructions to the Hotr2, and as entrusted with certain litanies. The Potr2, Nes2t2r2, and Brahman belonged to the ritual of the Soma sacrifice, the latter being later styled Bra1hman2a1ccham2sin to distinguish him from the priest who in the later ritual acted as supervisor. Other priests referred to in the Rigveda 4) Rv. viii. 81. 5. are the singers of Sa1mans or chants, the Udga1tr2 and his assistant the Prastotr2, while the Pratihartr2, another assistant, though not mentioned, may quite well have been known. Their functions undoubtedly represent a later stage of the ritual, the development of the elaborate series of sacrificial calls on the one hand, and on the other the use of long hymns addressed to the Soma plant. Other priests, such as the Acha1va1ka, 5) Cf., for the Acha1va1ka, Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxviii. 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 14, 8, etc.; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l'histoire de la liturgie ve4dique, 47; Oldenberg. Religion des Veda, 397, n. 2. The other three occur in the Aitareya and other Bra1hman2as. See St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the Gra1vastut, the Unnetr2, and the Subrahman2ya, were known later in the developed ritual of the Bra1hman2as, making in all sixteen priests, who were technically and artificially classed in four groups 6) A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 1, 4-6; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tras, xiii. 14, 1, etc. In the Rigveda Su1tra the order of the four sets is Hotr2, Brahman, Udga1tr2, and Adhvaryu. Sometimes a seventeenth priest is mentioned, but he was not usually approved, though the Kaus2i1takins maintained him as the Sadasya. See Satapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 4, 1, 19; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 348, n.; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 37; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 375. Hotr2, Maitra1varun2a, Acha1va1ka, and Gra1vastut; Udga1tr2, Prastotr2, Pratihartr2, and Subrahman2ya; Adhvaryu, Pratistha1tr2, Nes2t2r2, and Unnetr2; Brahman, Bra1hman2a1ccham2sin, Agni1dhra, and Petr2. Apart from all these priests was the Purohita, who was the spiritual adviser of the king in all his religious duties. Geldner 7) Vedische Studien, 2, 143 et seq. holds that, as a rule, when the Purohita actually took part in one of the great sacrifices he played the part of the Brahman, in the sense of the priest who superintended the whole conduct of the ritual. He sees evidence for this view in a considerable number of passages of the Rigveda 8) Rv. i. 44, 10; 94, 6; viii. 27, 1, etc. and the later literature, 9) Br2haspati is Purohita of the gods, Rv. ii. 24, 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 1, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 17, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 2; but Brahman in Rv. x. 141, 3; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, vi. 13; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 4, 21. Vasis2t2ha is Purohita, Rv. x. 150, 5, of Suda1s Paijavana, S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 11, 4; but Brahman of the Sunah2s4epa sacrifice, ibid, xv. 21. where Purohita and Brahman were combined or identified. Oldenberg, 10) Op. cit., 380 et seq. however, more correctly points out that in the earlier period this was not the case: the Purohita was then normally the Hotr2, the singer of the most important of the songs; it was only later that the Brahman, who in the capacity of overseer of the rite is not known to the Rigveda, acquired the function of general supervision hitherto exercised by the Purohita, who was ex officio skilled in the use of magic and in guarding the king by spells which could also be applied to guarding the sacrifice from evil demons. With this agrees the fact that Agni, pre-eminently 11) Agni as Hotr2 and Purohita occurs in Rv. i. 1, 1; iii. 3, 2; 11, 1; v. 11, 2. His Purohitaship is described in terms characteristic of the Hotr2's funcitons in Rv. viii. 27, 1; x. 1, 6. Deva1pi is Purohita and Hotr2. Rv. x. 98. the Purohita of men, is also a Hotr2, and that the two divine Hotr2s of the A1pri1 hymns are called 12) Rv. x. 66, 13; in x. 70, 7, purohita1v r2tvija1. the divine Purohitas. On the other hand, the rule is explicitly recognized in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 13) vii. 26. that a Ks2atriya should have a Brahman as a Purohita; and in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 14) iii. 5, 2, 1, etc. the Vasis2t2ha family have a special claim to the office of Brahman-Purohita, perhaps an indication that it was they who first as Purohitas exchanged the function of Hotr2s for that of Brahmans in the sacrificial ritual. The sacrifices were performed for an individual in the great majority of cases. The Sattra, 15) Oldenberg, 371. or prolonged sacrificial session, was, however, performed for the common benefit of the priests taking part in it, though its advantageous results could only be secured if all the members actually engaged were consecrated (di1ks2ita). Sacrifices for a people as such were unknown. The sacrifice for the king was, it is true, intended to bring about the prosperity of his people also; but it is characteristic that the prayer 16) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 22; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 18; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 12, 6; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, v. 5, 14, etc. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 141 et seq.; 376 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 97; Oldenberg, op. cit., 370397; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 224. for welfare includes by name only the priest and the king, referring to the people indirectly in connexion with the prosperity of their cattle and agriculture.

 ‘seer,’ is primarily a composer of hymns to the gods. In the Rigveda 1) i. 1, 2; 45, 3; viii. 43, 13, etc. reference is often made to previous singers and to contemporary poets. Old poems were inherited and refurbished by members of the composer's family, 2) i. 89, 3; 96, 2; iii. 39, 2; viii. 6. 11. 43; 76, 6, etc. but the great aim of the singers was to produce new and approved hymns. 3) i. 109, 2; ii. 18, 3; iii. 62, 7; vi. 50, 6; vii. 14, 4; 93, 1; viii. 23, 14, etc. It is not till the time of the Bra1hman2as that the composition of hymns appears to have fallen into disuse, 4) Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 151. though poetry was still produced, for example, in the form of Ga1tha1s, which the priests were required to compose themselves 5) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 2, 8; 3, 5. and sing to the accompaniment of the lute at the sacrifice. The R2s2i was the most exalted of Bra1hman2as, 6) Rv. ix. 96, 6, etc. Cf. Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 4, 4, 6, where preeminence is assigned to a Bra1hman2a descended from a R2s2i. and his skill, which is often compared with that of a carpenter, 7) Rv. i. 130, 6; v. 2, 11; 29, 15; 73, 10; x. 39, 14. So a poet is a Ka1ru(if from kr2, ‘make,’ but usually derived from kr2, ‘commemorate’), and makes (kr2, Rv. ii. 39. 8; viii. 62, 4) as well as creates (jan, Rv. vii. 15, 4; viii. 88, 4) hymns. was regarded as heaven-sent. 8) Rv. i. 37, 4; vii. 36. 1. 9; viii. 32, 27; 57. 6, etc. The Purohita, whether as Hotr2 or as Brahman (see R2tvij), was a singer. 9) Rv. i. 151, 7; Geldner, op. cit., 2, 153; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 380. No doubt the R2s2is were normally 10) Geldner, op. cit., 2, 154, cites the Da1nastutis as characteristic of princes in the tradition of the Br2haddevata1, etc. attached to the houses of the great, the petty kings of Vedic times, or the nobles of the royal household. Nor need it be doubted that occasionally 11) Ibid., 154. the princes themselves essayed poetry: a Ra1janyars2i, the prototype of the later Ra1jars2i or ‘royal seer,’ who appears in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 12) xii. 12, 6, etc. though he must be mythical as Oldenberg 13) Zeitschrift dev Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 45, 235. n. 3. points out, indicates that kings cultivated poetry 14) Later on it was deemed quite normal and natural. See the story of Rathavi1ti Da1rbhya, or Da1lbhya, himself a royal seer, and Taranta and Purumi1l2ha, seers and also kings, in Br2haddevata, v. 50 et seq. just as later they engaged in philosophic disputations. 15) Cf. Garbe, Philosophy of Ancient India, 73 et seq.; Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanis2ads, 16 et seq.; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 50. Normally, however, the poetical function is Brahminical, Vis4a1mitra and others not being kings, but merely Bra1hman2as, in the Rigveda. In the later literature the R2s2is are the poets of the hymns preserved in the Sam2hita1s. a R2s2i being regularly 16) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 25; viii. 26; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 4, 4; ii. 2, 3, 6; 5, 1, 4; vi, 1, 1, 1, etc.; Nirukta, vii. 3, etc. cited when a Vedic Sam2hita1 is quoted. Moreover, the R2s2is become the representatives of a sacred past, and are regarded as holy sages, whose deeds are narrated as if they were the deeds of gods or Asuras. 17) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 17; ii. 19; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 2, 7, etc. They are typified by a particular group of seven, 18) Cf. Indische Studien, 8, 167. mentioned four times in the Rigveda, 19) iv. 42, 8; x. 109, 4; 130, 7; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 144. several times in the later Sam2hita1s, 20) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 24; Av xi. 1, 1. 24; xii. 1, 39, etc. and enumerated in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 21) ii. 2, 6. as Gotama, Bharadva1ja, Vis4va1mitra, Jamadagni, Vasis2t2ha, Kas4yapa, and Atri. In the Rigveda itself Kutsa, 22) i. 106, 6. Atri, 23) i. 117, 3. Rebha, 24) i. 117, 4. Agastya, 25) i. 179, 6. the Kus4ikas, 26) iii. 53. 10. Vasis2t2ha, 27) vii. 33. 13. Vyas4va, 28) viii. 23, 16. and others appear as R2s2is; and the Atharvaveda 29) iv. 29. Cf. xviii. 3, 15. 16. contains a long list, including An3giras, Agasti1, Jamadagni, Atri, Kas4yapa, Vasis2t2ha, Bharadva1ja, Gavis2t2hira, Vis4va1mitra, Kutsa, Kaks2i1vant, Kan2va, Medha1tithi, Tris4oka, Us4ana1 Ka1vya, Gotama, and Mudgala. Competition among the bards appears to have been known. This is one of the sides of the riddle poetry (Brahmodya) that forms a distinctive feature 30) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 345, 346; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 172; Religion des Veda, 216 et seq. of the Vedic ritual of the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice. In the Upanis2ad period such competitions were quite frequent. The most famous was that of Ya1jn5avalkya, which was held at the court of Janaka of Videha, as detailed in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 31) iii. 1, 1 et seq. and which was a source of annoyance to Aja1tas4atru of Ka1s4i1. 32) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 1 et seq.; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 1 et seq. According to an analogous practice, a Bra1hman2a, like Udda1laka Arun2i, would go about disputing with all he came across, and compete with them for a prize of money. 33) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 4, 1, 1 et seq.; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3. 8 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 185, 344. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 340347; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 3, 120 et seq.

ऋषिस्
ऋषिस्
 --The term ‘Seven R2s2is’ denotes the ‘Great Bear’ (see 1. R2ks2a) in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 82, 2. and occasionally later. 2) Av vi. 40, 1 (where, however, Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 310. merely renders it as ‘seven seers,’ and appears not to take it in a technical sense); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 2, 4; xiii. 8, 1, 9; Nirukta, x. 26, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 422; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 144. This is probably a secondary use, instead of the seven R2ks2as, brought about by the frequent mention of the seven R2s2is.

ऋष्टि
ऋष्टि
 is a term frequently employed in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 37, 1; 64, 4. 8; 166, 4; v. 52, 6; 54, 11; 57, 6; viii. 20, 11. Indra has a R2s2t2i in Rv. i. 169, 3 (cf. Av. iv. 37. 8). Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 79. to designate a weapon held in the hands of the Maruts, and doubtless meant to indicate lightning. That it denotes a spear in mortal warfare, as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 301. thinks, is not shown by a single passage. 3) Rv. i. 167. 3; vii. 55. 2; viii. 28, 5; x. 87, 7. 24 are all mythological or contain similes. Cf. Schrader, Preshistoric Antiquities, 221.

ऋष्टिषेण
ऋष्टि-षेण
 is mentioned in the Nirukta 1) ii. 11. Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 130, 136. as an explanation of the patronymic A1rs2t2is2en2a, but nothing else is known of him.

ऋष्यशृङ्ग
ऋष्य-शृङ्ग
 appears as a teacher, pupil of Ka1s4yapa, and as bearing the patronymic Ka1s4yapa in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Brahman2a 1) iii. 40, 1 (in a Vam2s4a, or list of teachers). and in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 2) Indische Studien, 4, 374, 385. The more correct spelling of the name is R2s4ya-s4r2n3ga. 3) The later legend connected with the name may contain old elements (see Lu1ders, Die Sage von R2shyas4r2n3ga, 1897; Von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 292-301), but it is not known to any Vedic text. E.

एकद्यू
एक-द्यू
 is mentioned as a poet in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 80, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 112.

एकयवन्गांदम
एक-यवन् गां-दम
 is a man mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xxi. 14, 20. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 2) ii. 7, 11 (Ka1m2dama). Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, i. 32; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 69. 

एकराज्
एक-राज्,
 ‘sole ruler,’ ‘monarch,’ seems to mean no more than ‘king.’ In the Rigveda 1) viii. 37. 3. the term is used metaphorically only. But it is found with the literal sense in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 2) viii. 15. as well as in the Atharvaveda. 3) iii. 4, 1. Cf. Weber, Ra1jasu1ya, 141

एकायन
एकायन
 denotes some object of study in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 1) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. The St. Petersburg Dictionary renders it ‘doctrine (ayana) of unity’ (eka), ‘monotheism,’ while Max Mu7ller prefers ‘ethics,’ and Monier-Williams in his Dicitionary ‘worldly wisdom.’ 2) Max Mu7ller and Monier-Williams thus follow S4an3kara's interpretation as ni1ti-s4a1stra, ‘moral teaching.’ Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 267, 484; Little, Grammatical Index, 43.

एकाष्टका
एकाष्टका
 --That As2t2aka1 is the eighth day after the full moon appears clearly from the Atharvaveda. 1) xv. 16, 2. Cf. Satapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 2, 23; 4, 2, 10. Eka1s2t2aka1, or ‘sole As2t2aka1,’ must denote not merely any As2t2aka1, but some particular one. Sa1yan2a, in his commentary on the Atharvaveda, 2) iii. 10. in which a whole hymn celebrates the Eka1s2t2aka1, fixes the date meant by the term as the eighth day in the dark half of the month of Ma1gha (January--February). The Eka1s2t2aka1, is declared in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) vii. 4, 8 1. Cf. iii. 3, 8, 4; iv. 3, 11, 1; v. 7, 2, 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1l man2a, v. 9, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 305; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 341, 342. to be the time for the consecration (di1ks2a1) of those who are going to perform a year long sacrifice. See also Ma1sa.

एजत्क
एजत्क
 is the name of an insect in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 23, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindiches Leben, 98; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 262.

एडक
एडक
 appears to denote a ‘vicious ram’ in the S4atapatha 1) xii. 4, 1, 4; cf. ii. 5, 2, 15. and Jaimini1ya 2) i. 51, 4 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 332). Cf. Eggeling, Sacrea Books of the East, 44, 178. Bra1hman2as. 

एणी
एणी
 denotes the ‘female antelope’ in the later Sam2hita1s, 1) Av. v. 14, 11; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 15, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 17; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 36; Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82. perhaps as the feminine of Eta.

एत
एत
 in the plural (eta1h2) denotes the steeds of the Maruts, being a swift species of deer, which are mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 165. 2; 169, 6, 7; v. 54, 5; x. 77. 2. and the skins of which are also said to be worn by the Maruts on their shoulders. 2) Rv. i. 166, 10. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The epithet pr2thubudhna, once applied to them in the Rigveda, 3) i. 169. 6. and variously interpreted as ‘broad-hoofed,’ 4) By Grassman and Zimmer. ‘broad-chested,’ 5) Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 235. and ‘broad in the hinder part,’ 6) Monier-Williams, Dictionary, s.v. seems to indicate that they were not gazelles. 7) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83.

एतश
1. Etas4a is in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 62, 15; iv. 30. 6; v. 29. 5. according to Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the name of a prote4ge4 whom Indra helped against the sun-god Su1rya. But in all these passages Etas4a seems merely to designate the horse of the sun. 3) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 149. 150.

एतश
2. Etas4a is in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 1) xxx. 5. the name of a sage who is said to have cursed his children because they interrupted him in the midst of a rite; hence the Aitas4a1yanas (descendants of Etas4a) are declared to be the worst of the Bhr2gus. The same story appears in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a1 2) vi. 33. Cf. Hillebrandt. Vedische Mythologie, 2, 173. where, however, the sage's name is Aitas4a, and the Aitas4a1yanas are described as the worst of the Aurvas.

एदिधिषुःपति
एदिधिषुः-पति
 is a term occurring only in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 1) xxx. 9. where the commentator Mahi1dhara interprets it as meaning the ‘husband of a younger sister married before the elder sister.’ Though this sense is probably correct, the form is doubtless, as Delbru7ck 2) Die indogermanischen Verwandschaftsnamen, 569. n. 1. points out, corrupt. See Didhis2u1pati.

एरण्ड
एरण्ड,
 the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis), is first mentioned in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka (xii. 8).

एवावद
एवावद
 is regarded by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. in a very obscure passage of the Rigveda 2) v. 44, 10. as the name of a singer beside Ks2atra, Manasa, and Yajata. The commentator Sa1yan2a also interprets the word as a proper name. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, considers it to be an adjective meaning ‘truthful.’ AI.

ऐकादशाक्षमानुतन्तव्य
ऐकादशाक्ष मानु-तन्तव्य
 appears in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) v. 30. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 223. as a king who observed the rule of sacrificing when the sun had risen (udita-homin), and as a contemporary of Nagarin Ja1na-s4ruteya.

ऐक्ष्वाक
ऐक्ष्वाक,
 ‘descendant of Iks2va1ku,’ is the patronymic borne by Purukutsa in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) xiii. 5, 4, 5. Another Aiks2va1ka is Va1rs2n2i, a teacher mentioned in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 2) i. 5, 4. A king Haris4candra Vaidhasa Aiks2va1ka is known to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 3) vii. 13, 16. and Tryarun2a is an Aiks2va1ka in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 4) xiii. 3, 12.

ऐतरेय
ऐतरेय,
 perhaps a patronymic from Itara, though the commentator Sa1yan2a 1) Cited by Aufrecht, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 3. regards the word as a metronymic from Itara1, is an epithet of Mahida1sa in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 2) ii. 1, 8; 3. 7. and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 3) iii. 16, 7. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 389. The form Aitareyin occurs in the Anupada Su1tra, viii. 1; A1s4vala1yana Srauta Su1tra, i. 3, etc.; and a Mahaitareya in A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 4, 4, etc.

ऐतश
ऐतश, ऐतशायन
 See Etas4a, Etas4a1yana. The Aitas4aprala1pa, or ‘Discourse of Aitas4a,’ is a part of the Atharvaveda. 1) xx. 129-132. Cf. Br2haddevata1, viii. 101, with Macdonell's note.

ऐतिहासिक
ऐति-हासिक
 --This term was applied to the people who explained the Vedic hymns by treating them as legendary history (Itiha1sa), as Sieg 1) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 13 et seq. shows by the passages of the Nirukta, 2) ii. 16; xii. 1, etc. where their views are opposed to those of the Nairuktas, who relied rather on etymology. Sieg 3) Op. cit., 29. also seems right in finding them in the Naida1nas of the Nirukta: 4) vi. 9; vii. 6. it is possible that their textbook was called the Nida1na.

ऐभावत
ऐभावत,
 ‘descendant of Ibha1vant,’ is the patronymic of Prati1dars4a. 1) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 8, 2, 3.

ऐरावत
ऐरावत,
 ‘son of Ira1vant,’ is the patronymic of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, as a snake demon, 1) In the later literature Aira1vata is the elephant of Indra: perhaps connected with this Vedic snake demon. as na1ga means both ‘serpent’ and ‘elephant.’ in the Atharvaveda 2) viii. 10, 29. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) xxv. 15, 3.

ऐलूष
ऐलूष,
 ‘descendant of Ilu1s2a,’ is the patronymic of Kavas2a.

ऐषकृत
ऐष-कृत
 See S4itiba1hu. 

ऐषावीर
ऐषा-वीर
 --The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a once 1) xi. 2, 7, 32. refers to the Ais2a1-vi1ras as officiating at a sacrifice, with the implication that they were bad sacrificers. Sa1yan2a regards the word as a proper name (‘descendants of Es2avi1ra’), denoting the members of a despised family. But Roth may be right in explaining the word both in the passage mentioned above and elsewhere as meaning ‘weak’ 2) In the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or ‘insignificant man.’ 3) In Bo7htlingk's Dictionary, s.v. (‘one who wishes to be a man, but is not’). Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 5, 1, 16; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, i. 1, where, however, Lindner's edition reads sais2a1 vi1ra iva. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 228; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 45.

ऐषुमत
ऐषुमत,
 ‘descendant of Is2umant,’ is the patronymic of Tra1ta in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. O.

ओगण
ओगण
 is a word occurring only once, as a plural, in the Rigveda, 1) x. 89, 15 where it appears to indicate persons hostile to the seer of the hymn, and apparently opposed to the A1ryan religion. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 209. regards the terms as the proper name of a people, but Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 191, 192. thinks that it is merely an adjective meaning ‘weak’ (ogan2a = ava-gan2a), as in Pa1li.

ओतु
ओतु
 in Vedic literature 1) Rv. vi. 9, 2. 3; Av. xiv. 2, 51; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 1, 4, etc. denotes the ‘woof’ in weaving and corresponds to Tantu, ‘the warp,’ the roots va1, 2) Rv. vi. 9, 2. etc. ‘to weave,’ and tan, 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 80; Rv. x. 130, 2; Av. x. 7, 43, etc. to stretch,’ from which these two terms are derived, being used in parallel senses. In the process of weaving a shuttle (Tasara) was used. The ‘weaver’ is termed va1ya, 4) Rv. x. 26, 6, etc. and the ‘loom’ veman. 5) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 83. A wooden peg (Mayu1kha) was used to stretch the web on, while lead was employed as a weight to extend it. 6) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 80. The work of weaving was probably the special care of women. 7) Av. x. 7, 42; xiv. 2, 51. Cf. Rv. i. 92. 3. A metaphor in the Atharvaveda 8) x. 7, 42; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 5, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 254, 255; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 465. personifies Night and Day as two sisters weaving the web of the year, the nights serving as warp, the days as woof.

ओदन
ओदन
 is a common expression 1) Rv. viii. 69, 14, etc.; Av. iv. 14, 7, etc. denoting a mess, usually of grain cooked with milk (ks2i1ra-pa1kam odanam). 2) Rv. viii. 77, 10. Special varieties are mentioned, such as the ‘milk-mess’ (ks2i1raudana), 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 3, 4; xi. 5, 7, 5; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 13. the ‘curd-mess’ (dadhy-odana), 4) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 14. the ‘bean-mess’ (mudgaudana), 5) S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 8. the ‘sesame-mess’ (tilaudana), 6) Ibid.; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 15. the ‘water-mess’ (udaudana), 7) Ibid., vi. 4, 15. the ‘meat-mess’ (ma1m2saudana), 8) Ibid., vi. 4, 16; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 7, 5; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 8. the ‘ghee-mess’ (ghr2taudana), 9) S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 8. etc.

ओपश
ओपश
 is a word of somewhat doubtful sense, occurring in the Rigveda, 1) x. 85. 8, Cf. i. 173, 6; viii. 14, 5; ix. 71. 1. the Atharvaveda, 2) vi. 138, 1. 2; ix. 3, 8, where it is applied metaphorically in describing the roof of a house. and occasionally later. 3) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 1. It probably means a ‘plait’ as used in dressing the hair, especially of women, 4) Av. vi. 138. 1, 2. but apparently, in earlier times, 5) Rv. i. 173, 6; viii. 14, 5. of men also. The goddess Sini1va1li1 is called svaupas4a1, 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 5, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 56. The reading is uncertain. Bloomfield (see below) assumes sv-opas4a1 to be the correct form (‘having a fair opas4a’). an epithet of doubtful sense, from which Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 264. conjectures that the wearing of false plaits of hair was not unknown in Vedic times. What was the difference between the braic referred to in the epithets pr2thu s2t2uka, 8) Rv. x. 86, 8. ‘having broad braids,’ and vis2ita-s2t2uka, 9) Rv. i. 167, 5 (of Rodasi1). ‘having loosened braids,’ and the Opas4a cannot be made out from the evidence available. Geldner 10) Vedische Studien, 1, 131, quoting Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 3, where dvy-epas4a1h2 is used of cattle; but the sense may be figurative. thinks that the original sense was ‘horn,’ and that when the word applies to Indra 11) Rv. viii. 14, 5. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 538, 539; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 348. it means ‘diadem.’

ओषधि
ओषधि
 --Roughly speaking, the vegetable world is divided in Vedic literature 1) Rv. x. 97 and passim. Os2adhivanaspati is a frequent compound, from the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (vi. 1, 1, 12) onwards. The medicinal properties of plants account for the epithet ‘of manifold powers’ (na1na1-vi1rya1) applied to them in Av. xii. 1, 2. between Os2adhi or Vi1rudh ‘plants’ and Vana or Vr2ks2a ‘trees.’ Os2adhi is employed in opposition to Vi1rudh to denote plants as possessing a healing power or some other quality useful to men, while Vi1rudh is rather a generic term for minor vegetable growths, but sometimes, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 3, 2. when occurring beside Os2adhi, signifies those plants which do not possess medicinal properties. A list of the minor parts of which a plant is made up is given in the later Sam2hita1s. 3) Ibid., vii. 3, 19, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 28. It comprises the root (mu1la), the panicle (tu1la), the stem (ka1n2d2a), the twig (vals4a), the flower (pus2pa), and the fruit (phala), while trees 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 3, 20, 1. Cf. Rv. i. 32, 5; Av. x. 7, 38. have, in addition, a corona (skandha), branches (s4a1kha1), and leaves (parn2a). The Atharvaveda 5) viii. 7, 4, with Whitney's notes. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 579; Henry, Les livres VIII. et IX. de l' Atharvave4da, 58 et seq. gives an elaborate, though not very intelligible, division of plants into those which expand (pra-str2n2ati1h2), are bushy (stambini1h2), have only one sheath (eka-s4un3ga1h2), are creepers (pra-tanvati1h2), have many stalks (am2s4umati1h2), are jointed (ka1n2d2ini1h2), or have spreading branches (vi-s4a1kha1h2). In the Rigveda 6) x. 97. 3. 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben. 57. plants are termed ‘fruitful’ (phalini1h2), ‘blossoming’ (pus2pavati1h2), and ‘having flowers’ (pra-su1vari1h2). AU.

औक्षगन्धि
औक्ष-गन्धि
 (‘having the smell of bull's grease’) appears in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 37. 3. as the name of an Apsaras, beside other names, of which Guggulu1 and Naladi1 clearly indicate plants. This name, therefore, presumably also denotes some sort of fragrant plant. Auks2a in the same Sam2hita1 2) ii. 36. 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 324; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 211, 212, and on Auks2a, ibid., 82, 83. means ‘bull's grease’ (from aks2an, ‘bull’).

St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Udamaya. Aufrecht, however, in his edition more probably takes the correct form of the name to be Udamaya.

औपावि
 (‘descendant of Upa1va’) Ja1na-s4ruteya (‘descendant of Janas4ruti’), appears in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) v. 1, 1, 5. 7. and the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 2) i. 4, 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 222, 223. as a sacrificer who used to offer the Va1japeya sacrifice and ascend to the other world.

In the form of Aupoditeya, a metronymic from Upodita1, the name is found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) i. 9, 3. 16. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East. 12, 271, n. 2. where the Ka1n2va text calls him Tumin5ja Aupoditeya Vaiya1ghrapadya.

और्णवाभ
और्ण-वाभ,
 ‘descendant of U1rn2ava1bhi.’ (1) This is the name of a pupil of Kaun2d2inya mentioned in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) iv. 5, 26 (Ma1dhyam2dina recension). (2) A teacher of this name is frequently referred to in the Nirukta. His explanations in two passages 2) vii. 15; xii. 19. agree with those of the Nairuktas or etymological school of interpreters of the Rigveda. In other passages 3) vi. 13; xii. 1. he appears rather to belong to the school of the Aitiha1sikas, who relied on traditional legends. He was thus probably, as Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 13, n. 1. suggests, an eclectic.

और्व
और्व,
 ‘descendant of Uru or Urva,’ appears in the Rigveda 1) viii. 102, 4. in close connexion with Bhr2gu, being probably a Bhr2gu himself. As in one passage of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 2) vi. 33. the descendants of Aitas4a are called the worst of the Aurvas, while the parallel version of the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 3) xxx. 5. calls them the worst of the Bhr2gus, the Aurvas must have been a branch of the larger family of the Bhr2gus. Aurva himself is said in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 4) vii. 1, 8, 1. to have received offspring from Atri. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 5) xxi. 10, 6. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54, reads u1rvau. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 173, n. 1. two Aurvas are referred to as authorities. See also Kutsa.

औलान
औलान
 is a word occurring in a single passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 98, 11. where it may possibly be a patronymic of S4am2tanu as a ‘descendant of Ula.’ Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. however, conjectures that the reading should be ‘Kaula1na.’ Sieg 3) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 141. regards Aula1na as a later descendant 4) Cf. Sa1yan2a on Rv. x, 98, 11; Kuru kula-ja1tah2 S4a1m2tan2avah2, ‘a descendant of S4am2tanu, born in the family of the Kurus of S4am2tanu, who utilized the story of Deva1pi's rain-making as an introduction to his rain hymn.

औलुण्ड्य
औलुण्ड्य,
 ‘descendant of Ulun2d2a,’ is the patronymic of Suprati1ta in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. 

औशिज
औशिज,
 ‘descendant of Us4ij,’ is a patronymic clearly applied to Kaks2i1vant in the Rigveda. 1) i. 18, 1. It is also applied to R2jis4van, 2) x. 99, 11. but Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 143, 149. thinks that the correct reading of the passage in question is aus4ijasyarjis4va1, ‘R2jis4van, son of Aus4ija.’ In one verse 4) Rv. i. 112, 11. Aus4ija and Kaks2i1vant are both mentioned, but in such a way that two different persons must apparently be meant. In other passages where the patronymic occurs alone, it is doubtful who is meant, or whether a proper name at all is intended. 5) Rv. i. 119, 9; 122, 4; iv. 21, 6, 7; v. 41, 5; vi. 4, 6. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Kaks2i1vant Aus4ija appears also in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 6) xiv. 11, 16. See Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, xv. 56, n., and Kaks2i1vant, n. 15. and elsewhere.

औष्ट्राक्षि
औष्ट्राक्षि,
 ‘descendant of Us2t2ra1ks2a,’ occurs as the patronymic of Sa1ti in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 75. K.

कंस
कंस,
 a word denoting a ‘pot or vessel of metal,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda and elsewhere. 1) Av. x. 10, 5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 10; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 1, etc.; Nirukta, vii. 23; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 8.

ककर
ककर
 occurs in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 24. as the name of a victim at the horse sacrifice (As4vamedha). It probably denotes some ‘sort of bird,’ as rendered by the commentator Mahi1dhara. 2) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94.

ककुठ
ककुठ,
 a word occurring in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 1) iii. 14, 13. presumably denotes some kind of animal. According to Bo7htlingk, 2) Dictionary, s.v. it is identical with Kakkat2a. 

ककुह
ककुह,
 a word occurring several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 46, 3; 181 5; 184, 3; ii. 34, 11; iii. 54, 14; v. 73, 7; 75, 4; viii. 6, 48. is understood by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. to designate part of a chariot, perhaps the seat. Ludwig, 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 182; 3, 160, 161; 5, 142. again, regards it in one passage 4) viii. 6, 48. as the proper name of a Ya1dava prince who took spoil from Tirindira, the Pars4u, but this view is hardly probable. 5) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 36, 37. It is, on the whole, most likely that the word always means ‘chief,’ ‘pre-eminent,’ being applied as an epithet to horses, chariots, princes, etc. 6) So certainly in Rv. viii. 45, 14; ix. 67, 8; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 3, 1. 2, and often in the older form kakubha. This is the only sense given by Grassmann, 7) In his Lexicon, s.v. and later adopted by Roth. 8) In Bo7htlingk's Dictionary, s.v.

कक्कट
कक्कट
 denotes the ‘crab’ in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 15, 1 (where Weber has katkat2a); Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 32. being a Pra1kritized form of Karkat2a, which is common in the later literature. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, takes the word to mean a bird, and compares Kakara. See also Kakut2ha.

कक्ष
कक्ष
 is the name of two men mentioned as teachers in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. One is Kaks2a Va1rakya, pupil of Pros2t2hapada Va1rakya, 1) iii. 41, 1. and the other Kaks2a Va1ra1ki 2) iii. 41, 1. or Va1rakya1, 3) iv. 17, 1. pupil of Daks2a Ka1tya1yani A1treya. See also Urukaks2a.

कक्षीवन्त्
कक्षीवन्त्
 is the name of a R2s2i mentioned frequently in the Rigveda, 1) i. 18, 1; 51, 13; 112, 11; 116, 7; 117, 6; 126, 3; iv. 26, 1; viii. 9, 10; ix. 74, 8; x. 25, 10; 61, 16. and occasionally elsewhere. 2) Av. iv. 29, 5, and passage noted below. He appears to have been a descendant of a female slave named Us4ij. 3) Rv. i. 18, 1; perhaps also i, 112, 11, but Aus4ija may there be a separate name (see Aus4ija). Cf. Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 11, 16. He must have been a Pajra by family, as he bears the epithet Pajriya, 4) Rv. i. 116, 7; 117, 6. and his descendants are called Pajras. 5) Rv. i. 126, 4. In a hymn of the Rigveda 6) i. 126. he celebrates the prince Svanaya Bha1vya, who dwelt on the Sindhu (Indus), as having bestowed magnificent gifts on him; and the list of Na1ra1s4am2sas (‘Praises of Heroes’) in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 7) xvi. 4, 5. mentions one by Kaks2i1vant Aus4ija in honour of Svanaya Bha1vayavya. In his old age he obtained as a wife the maiden Vr2caya1. 8) Rv. i. 51, 13. He appears to have lived to be a hundred, 9) Rv. ix. 74, 8. the typical length of life in the Vedas. He seems always to be thought of as belonging to the past, and in a hymn of the fourth book of the Rigveda 10) iv. 26, 1. he is mentioned with the semi-mythical Kutsa and Kavi Us4anas. Later, also, he is a teacher of bygone days. 11) Av. iv. 29, 5; xviii. 3, 15; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 21, 6. 7; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 11. In Vedic literature he is not connected with Di1rghatamas beyond being once mentioned along with him in a hymn of the Rigveda. 12) viii. 9, 10 But in the Br2haddevata1 13) iv. 11 et seq. he appears as a son of Di1rghatamas by a slave woman, Us4ij. Weber 14) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 22-25. considers that Kaks2i1vant was originally a Ks2atriya, not a Bra1hman2a, quoting in favour of this view the fact that he is mentioned beside kings like Para A1t2n2a1ra, Vi1tahavya S4ra1yasa, and Trasadasyu Paurukutsya. 15) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 5, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxii. 3; Pancavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 16, 3, Cf. xiv. 11, 16. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 221, 236, n. 1; Ludwig Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 102; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 23, 24. But that these are all kings is an unnecessary assumption: these persons are mentioned in the passages in question undoubtedly only as famous men of old, to whom are ascribed mythical sacrificial performances, and who thus gained numerous sons.

कङ्क
कङ्क
 is the name of a bird, usually taken to mean ‘heron,’ 1) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92. but, at any rate in some passages, rather denoting some bird of prey. 2) Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 13. It first appears in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 4, 11, 1 (kan3ka-cit, an altar ‘piled in the form of a heron’); Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 31; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 12; Sa1maveda, ii. 9, 3, 6, 1 

कङ्कत
कङ्कत
 is the name of an animal mentioned once in the Rigveda. 1) i. 191, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98. According to Sa1yan2a it is a destructive beast; perhaps, as Grassmann renders it, a ‘scorpion.’

कङ्कतीय
कङ्कतीय
 is the name of a family said in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) ix. 4, 4, 17. to have learned from S4a1n2d2ilya the piling up of the sacrificial firse (agni-cayana.) In the A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra 2) xiv. 20, 4. a Kan3kati Bra1hman2a, no doubt the textbook of the school, is referred to. It may have been identical with the Cha1galeya Bra1hman2a, cited in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra. 3) xxv. 5. Cf. Caland, U7ber das vituclle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 40.

कङ्कपर्वन्
कङ्क-पर्वन्
 (‘heron-jointed’?), a term occurring once in the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 56, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 426; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 553; Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. is applied to a snake, meaning perhaps ‘scorpion.’ As the Paippala1da recension has a different reading (an3ga-parvan2ah2), the passage may be corrupt.

कट
कट
 denotes a ‘mat,’ which was ‘made of reeds’ (vaitasa). The maker of mats from reeds (bidala-ka1ri1) is mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 2) xxx. 8, with Mahi1dhara's Commentary. Bidala-ka1ra is read in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 5, 1. and the process of splitting reeds for the purpose is referred to in the Atharvaveda. 3) vi. 138, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 255. ^1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. v. 3, 12, 2. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 1, 3.

कण्टकीकारी
कण्टकी-कारी,
 ‘worker in thorns,’ is one of the victims at the human sacrifice (Purus2amedha) in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 1) xxx. 8. The Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 5, 1, has kan2t2aka-ka1ra. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 255. No doubt the thorns were cut up and used to plait mats (Kat2a) or to stuff cushions. 

कण्व
कण्व
 is the name of an ancient R2s2i repeatedly referred to in the Rigveda and later. 1) Rv. i. 36, 8. 10. 11. 17. 19; 39, 7. 9; 47, 5; 112, 5; 117, 18; 118, 7; 139, 9; v. 41, 4; viii. 5, 23. 25; 7, 18; 8, 20; 49, 10; 50, 10; x. 71, 11; 115, 5; 150, 5; Av. iv. 37, 1; vii. 15, 1; xviii. 3, 15; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 74; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, viii. 2, 2; ix. 2, 6; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxviii. 8, Kan2vavat occurs in Rv. viii. 6, 11; 52, 8; Av. ii. 32, 3; Kan2va-mant in Rv. viii. 2, 22. His sons and descendants, 2) As Kan2va1h2 (in the plural), Rv. i. 14, 2. 5; 37, 1. 14; 44, 8; 46, 9; 47. 2. 4-10; 49, 4; viii. 2, 16; 3, 16; 4, 2. 3; 5, 4; 6, 3. 18. 21. 31. 34. 47; 7, 32; 8, 3; 9, 14; 32, 1; 33, 3; 34, 4; as Kan2vasya su1navah2, Rv. i, 45, 5; as putra1h2, viii. 8, 4. 8; as Ka1n2va1yana1h2, viii. 55, 4. Ka1n2va is found in viii. 1, 8; 2, 40; 4, 20; 7, 19; 9, 3, 9; 10, 2. the Kan2vas, are also often mentioned, especially in the eighth book of the Rigveda, the authorship of that book, as well as of part of the first, being attributed to this family. A descendant of Kan2va is also denoted by the name in the singular, either alone 3) Eg., Rv. i. 48, 4; viii. 34, 1, and probably elsewhere. or accompanied by a patronymic, as Kan2va Na1rs2ada 4) Rv. i. 117, 8; Av. iv. 19, 2; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 150. and Kan2va S4ra1yasa, 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 4, 7, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxi. 8; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 9. besides in the plural the Kan2vas Saus4ravasas. 6) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 12. There is also Vatsa Ka1n2va in S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 11, 20. The Kan2va family appears to have been connected with the Atri family, 7) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 214. but not to have been of great importance. 8) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 285. Cf. 1, 207, 438. In one passage of the Atharvaveda 9) Av. ii. 25. Cf. Va1rttika on Pa1n2ini, iii. 1, 14; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 465; Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 207; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 110. Cf. Oldenberg, op. cit., 216 et seq.; Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 105. they seem to be definitely regarded with hostility.

कथा
कथा
 --The later use of this word 1) Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, 1, 293. in the sense of a ‘philosophical discussion’ appears in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 2) i. 8, 1: hantodgi1the katha1m2 vada1ma, ‘let us begin a discussion regarding the Udgi1tha.’

कद्रू
कद्रू,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 45, 26. is interpreted by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. as the name of a priest, but it more probably means a Soma vessel. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

कनक्नक
कनक्नक,
 a word occurring once in the Atharvaveda, 1) x. 4, 22. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 604; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 578. either denotes a poison or is an adjective qualifying ka1n2d2a1-vis2a, a species of poison.

कना
कना, कन्या
 --Both these words, of which the former is very rare, 1) Rv. x. 61, 5, etc. while the latter is the normal term from the Rigveda 2) i. 123, 10; 161, 5; iii. 23, 10, etc.; Av. i. 14, 2; xi. 5, 18; xii, 1, 25, etc. onwards, denote ‘maiden’ or ‘young woman.’ It is doubtful whether Kani1naka1 (accented on the final syllable) has this meaning, 3) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., cites in this sense Rv. iv. 32, 23; x. 40, 9; Nirukta, iv. 15; but neither of the Rv. passages is at all clear. or only denotes the pupil of the eye, 4) See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 401; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2ya1ka, 207. Other rare forms are kanyana1, Rv. viii. 35, 5; kauyala1, Av. v. 5, 3; xiv. 2, 52. which is the sense of kani1naka1 or kani1nika1 (both accented on the antepenultimate) in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. See also Stri1.

कपना
कपना,
 from its solitary occurrence in the Rigveda, 1) v. 54, 6. appears to mean a ‘worm’ that destroys the leaves of trees, and is so interpreted in the Nirukta. 2) vi. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 330.

कपर्द
कपर्द,
 ‘braid,’ Kapardin, ‘wearing braids.’ These words refer to the Vedic custom of wearing the hair in braids or plaits. Thus a maiden is said to have her hair in four plaits (catus2-kaparda1), 1) Rv. x. 114, 3. and the goddess Sini1va1li1 is described as ‘wearing fair braids’ (su-kaparda1). 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 56. Men also wore their hair in this style, for both Rudra 3) Rv. i. 114, 1. 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 10. 29. 43. 48. 59. and Pu1s2an 4) Rv. vi. 55, 2; ix. 67. 11. are said to have done so, while the Vasis2t2has 5) Rv. vii. 33, 1. Cf. 83, 8. were distinguished by wearing their hair in a plait on the right (daks2in2atas-kaparda). The opposite was to wear one's hair ‘plain’ (pulasti). 6) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 43. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 264, 265; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, v. 462; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 424. See also Opas4a. 

कपि
1. Kapi, ‘monkey,’ occurs only once in the Rigveda 1) x. 86. 5. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 174; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 22 et seq.; von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 304 et seq.; Schirmeisen, Die Arischen Go7ttergestalten, 218 et seq.; Tilak, Orion, 170-197. with reference to Vr2s2a1-kapi, the ‘Man-ape,’ in the dialogue of Indra and Indra1n2i1 in the presence of Vr2s2a1kapi. There the ape is termed the ‘tawny’ (harita). In the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 9, 4; iv. 32, 11; vi. 49, 1. Cf. also Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 6, 7 (kapy-a1sa, ‘seat of an ape’). the monkey is mentioned several times as hairy, and an enemy of dogs. That the ape was tamed appears from its position in the Vr2s2a1kapi hymn, and from the mention, in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 3) iv. 2, 10, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85, 86. of a Mayu as belonging to the forest. See also Mayu, Markat2a, and Purus2a Hastin.

कपि
2. Kapi is, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, another name for Lus4a Kha1rgali in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 (xxx. 2), but the name appears rather to be Lus4a1kapi.

कपिञ्जल
कपिञ्जल,
 the name of the ‘francoline partridge’ or ‘hazelcock,’ is found in all the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 1, 1; v. 5, 16, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 20. 38. and occasionally later. 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 3; v. 5, 4, 4; xiii. 5, 1, 13; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 154, 2 (Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 181). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91.

कपिल
कपिल
 appears in the S4veta1s4vatara Upanis2ad 1) v. 2. as a teacher, according to Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 24 et seq.; 5, 412; Indian Literature, 236. and Garbe, 3) Sa1n3khya Philosophie, 27 et seq.; Translation of the S4a1n3khyatattvakaumudi1, 531. who think that the expression kapila r2s2ih2 there refers to the founder of the Sa1n3khya philosophy. But this is doubtful. 4) Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xli, and Deussen, in his translation (Sechzig Upanishads, 304), do not take the word as a teacher's name. The latter renders kapila r2s2ih2, by ‘the red sage,’ as referring to Hiran2yagarbha. 

कपिवनभौवायन
कपि-वन भौवायन
 is mentioned as a teacher in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxii. 2. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 2) xx. 13, 4. A rite called Kapivana's Dvyaha (‘ceremony lasting two days’) is also referred to in the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra. 3) xxv. 2, 3. Cf. A1s4vala1yana Srauta Su1tra, x. 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 24, 3, 473; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 157.

कपोत
कपोत
 is the name of a bird, probably the ‘pigeon’ (its sense in the later language), occurring from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 30, 4; Av. xx. 135, 12; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 23. 38. It is associated in some passages 2) Rv. x. 165, 1-5; Av. vi. 29, 2. with the owl (Ulu1ka) as a messenger of Nirr2ti (‘dissolution,’ ‘misfortune’). This aspect of the pigeon as a bird of evil omen is probably based on an ancient belief which is also found beyond the confines of India. 3) Cf. Schrader, Prchistoric Antiquities, 253. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 89; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

कबन्धआथर्वण
कबन्ध आथर्वण
 is mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) vi. 7, 1. Cf. also Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 9. 18; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 176, n. 4; Weber, Indian Literature, 149. along with Sudhanvan A1n3girasa, as a teacher, but is semi-mythical. His son was Vica1rin Ka1bandhi.

कमद्यू
कम-द्यू
 appears once in the Rigveda 1) x. 65, 12. as the wife of Vimada. She is probably identical with the ‘maiden’ (yos2a1) of Purumitra, no doubt his daughter. She is elsewhere 2) i. 117, 20; x. 39, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 310. referred to in connexion with Vimada, who appears to have taken her for his bride against the will of her father.

कम्बल
कम्बल
 denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) xiv. 2, 66. 67. Cf. Nirukta, ii. 2. a ‘woollen coverlet’ or ‘blanket.’ 

कम्बोज
कम्बोज।--यास्क,
 in the Nirukta, 1) ii. 2. refers to the speech of the Kambojas as differing from that of the other A1ryas. The Kambojas were later settled to the north-west of the Indus, and are known as Kambujiya in the old Persian inscriptions. A teacher, Ka1mboja Aupamanyava, pupil of Madraga1ra, is mentioned in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 2) Indische Studien, 4, 372. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 102; Weber, Indische Streifen, 2, 493; 3, 384; Indische Studien, 10, 7; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 45; Max Mu7ller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 7, 373. On the relation of Indian and Iranian, see also Jacobi, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 721 et seq.; 1910, 457 et seq.; Oldenberg, ibid., 1095 et seq.; Keith, ibid., 1100 et seq.; Kennedy, ibid., 1107 et seq.; and see Pars4u. This points to a possible connexion of the Madras, or more probably the Uttara Madras, with the Kambojas, who probably had Iranian as well as Indian affinities.

करञ्ज
करञ्ज,
 a word which in the Su1tras and later denotes the tree Pongamia glabra, occurs only twice in the Rigveda 1) i. 53, 8; x. 48, 8. as the name of a foe of Indra, but whether a demon or a man 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 149; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 292. is intended remains uncertain.

करम्भ
करम्भ
 is the name, from the Rigveda onwards, 1) Rv. i. 187, 16; iii. 52, 7; vi. 56, 1; 57, 2; viii. 102, 2; Av. iv. 7, 2. 3; vi. 16, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 10, 2; vi. 5, 11, 4, etc. of a kind of porridge made of grain (Yava), which was unhusked, parched slightly, and kneaded. 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 2, 14; iv. 2, 4, 18. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 317; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 395, n. 1. It was the especial sacrificial portion of Pu1s2an, no doubt in his capacity of an agricultural deity. Karmabha was also made of barley (Upava1ka) 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 22. or of sesame (Tirya). 4) Av. iv. 7, 3, but see Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 377; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 155. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 270. 

करिक्रत
करिक्रत
 denotes, according to Zimmer, 1) Altindisches Leben, 95 a snake in the Atharvaveda. 2) x. 4, 13. The Paippala1da version has Kanikrada.

करीर
करीर,
 the name of a leafless shrub, Capparis aphylla, or its fruit, first appears in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 1) ii. 4, 9, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 11; xxxvi. 7; S4atapatha Brahman2a, ii. 5, 2, 11.

करीष
करीष
 denotes ‘dry cow dung’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) ii. 1, 1, 7. The Atharvaveda 2) Av. iii. 14, 3. 4; xix. 31, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236. shows that the value of the natural manure of animals in the fields was appreciated.

कर्कन्धु
1. Karkandhu is the ordinary word for ‘jujube,’ the tree (Zizyphus jujuba) and the fruit, from the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s onwards. 1) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 10; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 23. 91; xxi. 32; xxiv. 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 10; xii. 7, 2, 9; 9, 1, 5, etc.; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 156. 5. The berry is red (rohita). 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 242. Compare Kuvala and Badara, which denote the fruit.

कर्कन्धु
2. Karkandhu is only the name borne by a prote4ge4 of the As4vins in the Rigveda (i. 112, 6). Its identity with the word for jujube indicates that the latter, though not otherwise mentioned there, was known at the time of the Rigveda.

कर्करि
कर्करि,
 a musical instrument, probably the ‘lute,’ occurs from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. ii. 43, 3; Av. iv. 37. 4. Cf. xx. 132. 3. 8. The Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 2) iv. 2, 9. Cf. Delbru7ck, Gurupu1ja1kaumudi1, 48, 49. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289. mentions cattle branded on the ears with a mark resembling a lute (karkari-karn2yah2). 

कर्की
कर्की
 may denote in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 38, 6. 7. Cf. Bloomfield Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 414. a white cow,’ according to the suggestion of Roth. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary and Bo7htlingk's Dictionary, s.v.

कर्णशोभन
कर्ण-शोभन
 denotes an ‘ornament for the ear’ in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 78, 3. apparently for the use of men. Some deity is called ‘gold-eared’ in another passage of the Rigveda. 2) i. 122, 14. See also i. 64, 10. Hopkins 3) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 35. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262. considers the use of ear-rings later than that of necklets and wristlets.

कर्णश्रवसाङ्गिरस
कर्ण-श्रवस् आङ्गिरस
 is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiii. 11, 14) as a seer of Sa1mans or chants, the same tale being told of him as of Da1vasu.

कर्मार
कर्मार,
 the ‘smith,’ is several times mentioned with approval in the Vedic Sam2hita1s. 1) Rv. x. 72, 2; Av. iii. 5, 6; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 27; xxx. 7. Cf. karma1ra, Rv. ix. 112, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 3, 1. In the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 5, 6. The exact sense of the passage is doubtful. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 144; and Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 92, take the reference to be to ‘skilled chariot-makers’ (dhi1va1no ratha-ka1ra1h2) and ‘clever smiths,’ but this is perhaps less likely. The commentator interprets dhi1va1nah2 as ‘fishermen’ (in the later language dhi1vara means both a ‘clever man’ and a ‘fisherman’). smiths appear with fishermen (dhi1va1nah2) and chariot-builders (rathaka1ra1h2), all being classified as clever workers (mani1s2in2ah2): possibly a quasi-caste of smiths was already developing from the guild organization that probably existed. 3) Cf. Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 182. Little is known of the smith's methods of work and of his tools. No doubt he smelted (dhma1) the ore in the fire; hence he is called dhma1tr2, the ‘smelter.’ 4) Rv. v. 9. 5. Mention is also made of his bellows of birds' feathers. 5) Rv. ix. 112, 2. He made metal vessels (gharma ayasmaya) 6) Rv. v. 30, 15. to be put on the fire: even the Soma cup could occasionally be made of hammered metal (ayo-hata). 7) Rv. ix. 1, 2. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 252, 253; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 196 et seq.; U7ber den Ra1jasu1ya, 19 et seq.

कर्वर
कर्वर,
 a word found in one passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) x. 4, 19. seems to mean some kind of fish 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 578. caught by a fisherman (paun5jis2t2ha).

कर्षू
कर्षू,
 a rare word found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) i. 8, 1, 3; xiii. 8, 3, 10. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 283. denotes a ‘furrow’ or ‘trench.’

कलविङ्क
कलविङ्क,
 a name of the ‘sparrow,’ is found in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 1, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 10; Va1jasaneyi Samhita1, xxiv. 20. 31. and occasionally later. 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 4; v. 5, 4, 5; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 154, 3 (Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 181). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91.

कलश
कलश
 is, from the Rigveda onwards, 1) Rv. i. 117, 12; iii. 32, 15; iv. 27, 5; 32, 19, etc.; Av. iii. 12, 7; ix. 1, 6; 4, 15; xviii. 4, 13, etc. In Rv. x. 32, 9, the word, according to the S4t. Petersburg Dictionary, is used as a proper name, but the passage is very doubtful. a common word for ‘pot’ or ‘jar,’ probably either formed of a gourd or made of clay (unburnt or baked), as we know that both kinds of pot were in use. 2) Av. iv. 17, 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 1, 8, 1; iv. 1, 5, 4; v. 1, 7, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 22; xi. 59. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 253; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 257; Oertel, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 185, n. 3; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 183 et seq. The wooden Soma tub (dron2a-kalas4a) is frequently referred to in the ritual. See also Kos4a. 

कला
कला
 denotes a fractional part, normally ‘one-sixteenth,’ in the Rigveda 1) viii. 47, 17. and later. 2) Av. vi. 96, 3; xix. 57, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 10, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 7, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 3, 1; xii. 8, 3, 13, etc.; Nirukta, xi. 12. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 259. It is often mentioned in connexion with S4apha, ‘one-eighth.’

कलि
1. Kali. See Aks2a.

कलि
2. Kali occurs in the Rigveda, twice in the singular 1) i. 112, 15; x. 39, 8. as the name of a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, and once in the plural. 2) viii. 66, 15. The persons meant in the latter passage seem to be different from the former one. The Kalis are once mentioned in the Atharvaveda 3) x. 10, 13. beside the Gandharvas. 4) These Kalis may be connected with dicing, as in the Atharvaveda the Apsarases, the wives of the Gandharvas, are fond of dice, and bestow luck at play. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 135. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 89; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

कल्प
कल्प
 in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka (ii. 10) seems to denote Kalpa Su1tra.

कल्माषग्रीव
कल्माष-ग्रीव
 (‘speckled-neck’) is the name of a snake in the Atharvaveda. 1) iii. 27, 5 (where the Paippala1da recension has kulma1s2a-); xii. 3, 59. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 10, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94, 95.

कल्याण
कल्याण
 is the name, in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xii. 11, 10. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68, n. 2. of an A1n3girasa who saw the Aurn2a1yava Sa1man. 

कवच
कवच
 denotes a ‘corselet’ or ‘breastplate’ in the Atharvaveda 1) Av. xi. 10, 22 (kavacin). and later. 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 2, 7; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 19, 2; Nirukta, v. 25 (kavaca); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 1, 6, 3; 4, 1, 5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 48; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 45 (kavacin). There is nothing to show whether it was made of metal, but that it was so is quite possible (see Varman). The Atharvaveda 3) xi. 10, 22. refers to a ‘corselet-strap’ (kavaca-pa1s4a), which may point to a linen corselet such as those known to Herodotus. 4) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 129, and Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 659, seem to recognize coats of mail only.

कवष
कवष
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 12. as one of those whom, together with the Druhyu king, Indra overthrew for the Tr2tsus. The Anukraman2i1 (Index) also attributes to him the authorship of several hymns of the Rigveda, including two (x. 32. 33) that deal with a prince Kurus4ravan2a and his descendant Upamas4ravas. There seems no reason to doubt this attribution, which is accepted by both Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 127. and Geldner. 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 150. The former holds that Kavas2a was the Purohita of the joint tribes named Vaikarn2a, in whom he sees the KuruKrivi (Pan5ca1la) peoples, and that Kavas2a in that capacity is mentioned in the Rigveda as representative of those peoples. He also suggests that the language of Rigveda x. 33, 4 is best explained by the reduced position in which the Kuru-Krivis found themselves on their defeat by the Tr2tsus. Ludwig, 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139. on the other hand, thinks that Kavas2a was the priest of the five peoples. Geldner 5) Loc. cit. holds that Kavas2a was the Purohita of Kurus4ravan2a, by whose son, Upamas4ravas, he was ill-treated, and that he composed Rigveda x. 33 to deprecate the anger of his royal master. Hopkins 6) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261, 263. thinks that he was a king. In the Bra1hman2as of the Rigveda 7) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 19; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xii. 1, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 459; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386, 387; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 50. mention is made of Kavas2a Ailu1s2a, who was a Bra1hman2a born of a female slave, and was reproached on this ground by the other R2s2is. He is possibly identical with the Kavas2a of the Rigveda.

कश
कश
 is the name of an unknown animal mentioned as a victim at the horse sacrifice in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 17, 1; 18, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 26; 38. Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84.

कशीका
कशीका
 is name of an animal mentioned once in the Rigveda, 1) i. 126, 5. and interpreted as ‘weasel’ by the commentator Sa1yan2a. Fick 2) Bezzenberger, Beitra7ge, 3, 165; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 247. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 57. suggests that the meaning is ‘pole-cat.’ Geldner 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 44. takes it as ‘female ichneumon.’

कशिपु
कशिपु
 denotes a ‘mat’ or ‘cushion’ made, according to the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 138, 5. by women from reeds (nad2a), which they crushed for the purpose by means of stones. On the other hand, the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 4, 3, 1. refers to a mat as made of gold.

कशु
कशु
 is the name of a prince mentioned in the Rigveda with the patronymic Caidya, or descendant of Cedi, as a generous patron of the singer, who praises the liberality of the Cedis. Neither this king nor the Cedis appear again in Vedic literature. ^1) viii. 5, 37. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 129.

कशोजू
कशो-जू
 occurs once in the Rigveda (i. 112, 14) either as a proper name or as an epithet of Divoda1sa. The sense of the word is quite uncertain.

कश्यप
कश्यप,
 a word denoting ‘tortoise,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 20. 7. and often later. 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 18; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 37; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 5, 1, 5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 86; Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 403.

काम्पील
काम्पील
 --In one passage of the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 19, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 12, 20; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, As4vamedha, iv. 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 18; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 6; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 8, 3. the epithet Ka1mpi1la-va1sini1 is applied to a woman, perhaps the king's Mahis2i1 or chief wife, whose duty it was to sleep beside the slaughtered animal at the horse sacrifice (As4vamedha).

So also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204; von Schroeder, Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 1, xxi; Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 164; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 321, 322. agree in regarding Ka1mpi1la as the name of the town known as Ka1mpi1lya in the later literature, and the capital of Pan5ca1la in Madhyades4a.

 is the name of a people mentioned in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 1) xx. 13. (14). Cf. Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, i. 2, 14. and the A1pastamba 2) xxii. 6, 18. and Hiran2yakes4i 3) xvii. 6, Cf.

कारि
 is the name of one of the victims of the human sacrifice (Purus2amedha) in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 1) xxx. 6. 20; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 2, 1. and is there dedicated to ‘laughter.’ The commentator Mahi1dhara 2) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. interprets the word as ‘worker’ (karan2a-s4i1la), but the St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that it means a ‘jubilant’ person (as derived from the root kr2, ‘to praise’).

कारीरदि
कारीरदि
 is the name of persons mentioned in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (ii. 4, 4) as holding a special view of the Udgi1tha (Sa1maveda Chant).

कारु
कारु,
 ‘poet,’ is a word almost confined to the Rigveda. 1) i. 148, 2; 165, 12; 177, 5; 178, 3; ii. 43, 1; iii. 33, 8; 39, 7; v. 33, 7; vii. 27; 68, 9; 72, 4, etc.: Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 8, 7; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 21. There is evidence that the poet was regarded as a professional man, just as much as the physician (Bhis2aj). 2) ix. 112. 3. The poets, no doubt, mainly lived at the courts of princes amid their retainers, 3) vii. 73. 1. though they would probably also sing the praises of rich merchants. There was probably no essential connexion between the priest and the poet. Though the priest was often a poet, yet poetry can hardly have been restricted to the priestly caste. Indeed, at the horse sacrifice (As4vamedha) the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 4) xiii. 1, 5, 1; 4, 3, 5. expressly requires that one of the singers of panegyrics should be a Ra1janya, while the other was a Bra1hman2a, both singing verses of their own composition. The Anukraman2i1 (Index) in several cases 5) E.g., x. 92 is attributed to S4a1rya1ta Ma1nava. attributes hymns of the Rigveda to princes; and even though this may often be merely the same sort of procedure 6) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 3, 202. as has made S4u1draka the author of the Mr2cchakat2ika1, or Hars2a of the Ratna1vali1, and has given us royal teachers of the Brahman doctrine, 7) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 20, n. 4, sees in Av. xx. a recension of Ks2atriya character. He also finds Ks2atriyas in Vis4va1mitra and Kaks2i1vant, but hardly with reason. Cf. Varn2a. still the Indian tradition evidently saw nothing odd in the idea of nonBra1hman2as as poets. Most of the non-sacred poetry has, however, disappeared, for the epic is a product, as it stands, of a later period. See also R2s2i.

कारोतर
कारोतर
 appears to denote in the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 7. and occasionally later, 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 16, 82; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 9, 1, 2; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, ii. 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 280. a ‘filter’ or ‘sieve’ for purifying the liquor called Sura1.

कारोती
कारोती
 is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (ix. 5, 2, 15) as a place, or perhaps a river, where Tura Ka1vas2eya made a fire-altar--that is, as a seat of the fire-cult par excellence.

 (‘son of Ka1rs4akeyi1’) is the name of a man mentioned in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. In the Ka1n2va (vi. 5, 2) recension he is a pupil of Pra1ci1nayogi1putra; in the Ma1dhyam2dina (vi. 4, 33) recension his teacher's name is Pra1s4ni1putra A1suriva1sin.

कार्ष्णायस
कार्ष्णायस
 (‘black metal’), a word found in the Upanis2ads, 1) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 17, 7; vi. 1, 5; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 17, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 52. must clearly mean ‘iron.’ See Ayas.

कार्ष्मन्
कार्ष्मन्,
 a word meaning literally ‘furrow,’ and found only in the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 17; ix. 36, 1; 74, 8. is the designation of the goal in the chariot race. The competitor probably turned round it and came back to the starting-place. 2) Av. ii. 14, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 291, 292.

कार्ष्मर्य
कार्ष्मर्य
 is the name of a tree (Gmelina arborea) which is often alluded to in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 1) v. 2, 7, 3. 4; vi. 2, 1, 5. the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 2) iii. 2, 6; 7, 9. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 3) iii. 4, 1, 6; 8, 2, 17; iv. 3, 3, 6; vii. 4, 1, 37. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. 

काल
काल,
 the generic expression for ‘time,’ first occurs in the Rigveda, 1) x. 42, 9. where, however, it is used only once, in the late tenth book. It is known to the Atharvaveda, 2) xix. 53. 54. where Ka1la has already developed the sense of time as fate. The word is frequent in the Bra1hman2as, 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 3, 3; ii. 4, 2, 4; iii. 8, 3, 36; vii. 2, 2, 21, etc. superseding the earlier use of R2tu. The more general division of time is into ‘past’ (bhu1ta), ‘present’ (bhavat), and ‘future’ (bhavis2yat). 4) E.g., Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, vii. 20. For other divisons see Ahan, Ma1sa, Sam2vatsara.

कालका
कालका
 is the name of one of the victims at the horse sacrifice (As4vamedha) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 15, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 16; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 35. variously identified with a bird 2) Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. or a chameleon. 3) Sa1yan2a on Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99.

कालकाञ्ज
काल-काञ्ज
 --In the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 80, 2. mention is made of the Ka1laka1n5jas as being in the sky. Both Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 353. hold that some constellation is meant. But as the defeat of the Ka1laka1n5jas is one of Indra's exploits, 4) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 1, Cf. also Maitra1yani1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 4-6; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii, 1. it is doubtful whether any stress can be laid on that interpretation of the passage in the Atharvaveda. Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 341. suggests that the three stars of Orion are meant, Bloomfield 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 500; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 163-169. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 410, 414 et seq.; 3, 465; Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 121. that the galaxy or the stars in general are intended. 

कावषेय
कावषेय
 (‘descendant of Kavas2a’) is the constant patronymic of Tura. The Ka1vas2eyas are also mentioned as teachers of philosophical points in the Rigveda A1ran2yakas. 1) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 6; Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 11. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391, n.; 2, 418; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 257.

काव्य
काव्य
 (‘descendant of Kavi’) is the constant 1) Rv. i. 51, 11; 83, 5; 121, 12; vi. 20. 11; viii. 23, 17; Av. iv. 29, 6; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 8, 5, etc. patronymic of Us4anas. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a it is also applied to Id2hat 2) xiv. 9, 16. and Uks2n2orandhra. 3) xiii. 9, 19. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 48, 49.

काश
काश
 --Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. finds this word, which denotes a species of grass (Saccharum spontaneum) used for mats, etc., in one passage of the Rigveda, 2) x. 100, 10. but the reading is uncertain. The word has this sense in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 3) vi. 9, 1.

काशि
काशि, काश्य
 --The name Ka1s4i denotes (in the plural 1) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 19. 21. The plural occurs also in the Paippala1da recension of the Atharvaveda, v. 22, 14.) the people of Ka1s4i (Benares), and Ka1s4ya, the king of Ka1s4i. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 5, 4, 19. tells of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, king of Ka1s4i, who was defeated by S4ata1ni1ka Sa1tra1jita, with the result that the Ka1s4is, down to the time of the Bra1hman2a, gave up the kindling of the sacred fire. Sa1tra1jita was a Bharata. We hear also of Aja1tas4atru as a king of Ka1s4i; 3) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 1; iii. 8, 2; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 1. and no doubt Bhadrasena Aja1tas4atrava, a contemporary of Udda1laka, was also a king of Ka1s4i. The Ka1s4is and Videhas were closely connected, as was natural in view of their geographical position. The compound name Ka1s4i-Videha occurs in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad; 4) Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, loc. cit. in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 5) iii. 8, 2. Ga1rgi1 describes Aja1tas4atru as either a Ka1s4i or a Videha king. The S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 6) xvi. 29, 5. mentions one Purohita as acting for the kings of Ka1s4i, Kosala, and Videha; and the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 7) xxi. 13. mentions Ka1s4i and Videha in close proximity. Weber, 8) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 212, 213. indeed, throws out the suggestion that the Ka1s4is and the Videhas together constitute the Us4i1naras, whose name is very rare in Vedic literature. As Kosala and Videha were in close connexion, Ka1s4i and Kosala are found combined in the compound name Ka1s4iKaus4alyas of the Gopatha Bra1hman2a. 9) i. 2, 9. Though Ka1s4i is a late word, it is quite possible that the town is older, as the river Varan2a1vati1 referred to in the Atharvaveda 10) iv. 7. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 20; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 376. may be connected with the later Va1ra1n2asi1 (Benares). It is significant that while the Ka1s4is, Kosalas, and Videhas were united, any relations which the Kuru-Pan5cala peoples may have had with them were hostile. It is a fair conclusion that between these two great groups of peoples there did exist some political conflict as well as probably a difference of culture in some degree. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 11) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170 et seq.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xlii et seq., 104, n. 1. in the story of the advance of A1ryan civilization over Kosala and Videha, preserves a clear tradition of this time, and a piece of evidence that in the Kuru-Pan5ca1la country lay the real centre of the Bra1hman2a culture (see also Kuru-Pan5ca1la). That the Kosala-Videhas were originally settlers of older date than the Kuru-Pan5ca1las is reasonably obvious from their geographical position, but the true Bra1hman2a culture appears to have been brought to them from the Kuru-Pan5cala country. It is very probable that the East was less A1ryan than the West, and that it was less completely reduced under Brahmin spiritual supremacy, as the movement of Buddhism was Eastern, and the Buddhist texts 12) See Fick, Die seciale Gliederung, chap. iv. reveal a position in which the Ks2atriyas rank above Bra1hman2as. With this agrees the fact that the later Vedic texts 13) Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, xxii. 4, 22; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 6, 28. See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 99; Fick, op. cit., 140, n. 1; and of. Magadha. display towards the people of Magadha a marked antipathy, which may be reasonably explained by that people's lack of orthodoxy, and which may perhaps be traced as far back as the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 14) xxx. 5. 22. See Magadha. It is, of course, possible that the Kosala-Videhas and Ka1s4is actually were merely offshoots of the tribes later known as the Kuru-Pan5ca1las, and that they by reason of distance and less complete subjugation of the aborigines lost their Brahminical culture. This hypothesis, however, appears less likely, though it might be supported by a literal interpretation of the legend of the Aryan migration in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 15) Cf. Eggeling, loc. cit., 104, n. 1. Cf. Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 837, 1143; Keith, ibid., 831, 1138; Oldenberg, Buddha, 402 et seq.

कास्यप
कास्यप
 (‘descendant of Kas4yapa’) is a common patronymic, 1) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 5, 1, 5; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 18; x. 1, 8, etc. and is applied specially to R2s4yas4r2n3ga, Devataras S4ya1vasa1yana, S4u1s2a Va1hneya.

काश्यपीबालाक्यामाठरीपुत्र
काश्यपी-बालाक्या-माठरी-पुत्र

काषायण
काषायण

काष्ठा
काष्ठा
 seems to have the sense in the Rigveda 1) i. 37, 10; 65, 3; iv. 58, 7; vi. 46, 1; vii. 93, 3; viii. 80, 8; ix. 21, 7. of ‘course’ for a chariot race. It also means in the Rigveda 2) x. 102, 9, is perhaps so to be taken. and later 3) Av. ii. 14, 6: Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 9, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 13; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 7; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 7, 2. etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 291, 292; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 77. ‘goal,’ either like the Ka1rs2man the turning place, or the final goal (parama1 ka1s2t2ha1). 

कास्
कास्, कास, कासा, कासिका
 --All these four forms 1) Ka1s: Av. i. 12, 3; v. 22, 10; Ka1sa: Av. v. 22, 11 (probably); Ka1sa1: Av. vi. 105, 1 et seq.; Ka1sika1: Av, v. 22, 12; xi. 2, 22. of the same word denote ‘cough,’ which is mentioned in the Atharvaveda as accompanying a headache, 2) Av. i. 12, 3. as a symptom in fever (Takman), 3) v. 22, 10. and as an independent disease. 4) vi. 105. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 385; Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 394; Jolly, Medicin, 89.

 (‘descendant of Kahod2a’) is the patronymic of Argala in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 (xxv. 5).

किंशुक
किंशुक
 is the name of a tree (Butea frondosa) mentioned in the wedding hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. Sa1yan2a thinks the meaning is that the car is made of the wood of the tree. the bridal car being described as adorned with its blossoms (su-kim2s4uka).

किकिदीवि
किकि-दीवि
 denotes some kind of bird, perhaps the blue jay. 1) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. See Rv. x. 97, 13. According to the commentator, it means ‘partridge’ (tittiri) in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 2) v. 6, 22, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 251.

कितव
कितव,
 ‘the gambler,’ is frequently referred to in the Rigveda 1) ii. 29, 5; v. 85, 8; x. 34, 3. 7. 10. 11. 13. and later. 2) Av. vii. 50, 1; 109, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 8. 18. 22; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 19, etc. A father is represented as chastising his son for gambling. 3) Rv. ii. 29, 5. Cf. Pitr2. The gambler seems at times to have fallen, along with his family, into servitude, presumably by selling himself to pay his debts. 4) Rv. x. 34. Cf. perhaps the bhaktada1sa, ‘slave for hire,’ of the Ma1nava Dharma Sa1stra, viii. 415; Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 197. Technical names 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 3, 1 et seq.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 18. for different sorts of gamblers given in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s are A1dinava-dars4a, Kalpin, Adhi-kalpin, and Sabha1-stha1n2u. None of these can be safely 6) Cf. Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 18, 282; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 284. explained, though the last has usually 7) So Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 18; Sa1yan2a on Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 16, 1. been taken as a satirical name derived from the gambler's devotion to the dicing place (Sabha1), ‘pillar of the dicing hall.’ The first literally means ‘seeing ill-luck,’ 8) Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Weber, loc. cit. and may refer to the quickness of the dicer to note an error on the part of his antagonist, or to his eagerness to see the defeat of his rival.

किंपुरुष
किं-पुरुष,
 lit. ‘what sort of man,’ appears in the Bra1hman2as 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 8; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 3, 9; vii. 5, 2, 32. to designate the ‘ape,’ which is a mimic man. Possibly the same sense should be seen in the passage of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 2) xxx. 16; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 12, 1. where it occurs, and where Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. assumes it to refer to a contemptible man. Max Mu7ller 4) Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 420. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 246; Omina und Portenta, 356; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 51, n. 3. renders it ‘savage.’

कियाम्बु
कियाम्बु
 is the name of one of the water-plants which are to grow, according to a funeral hymn in the Rigveda, 1) x. 16, 13 = Av. xviii. 3, 6. on the place where the body of the dead was burned. The word seems to mean ‘having some water,’ possibly by popular etymology. 2) Cf. Sa1yan2a on Rv., loc. cit., and on Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, vi. 4, 1, 2, where Kya1mbu is the form. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62; Bloomfield, Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1890, xl.

किरात
1. Kira1ta is a name applied to a people living in the caves of the mountains, as appears clearly from the dedication of the Kira1ta to the caves (guha1) in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 1) xxx. 16; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 12, 1. and from the reference in the Atharvaveda 2) x. 4, 14. to a Kira1ta girl (kaira1tika1), who digs a remedy on the ridges of the mountains. Later 3) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 530, 534. the people called Kira1tas were located in Eastern Nepal, but the name seems to have been applied to any hill folk, no doubt aborigines, though the Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra 4) x. 44. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 32; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 207; V. Smith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Socicty, 1909, 258, n. 1; Le4vi, Le Ne4pal, 2, 77. regards them as degraded Ks2atriyas.

किरात
2. Kira1ta. --In the story of Asama1ti there appear, as the two priests who are opposed to the Gaupa1yanas, Kira1ta and Akuli according to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xiii. 12, 5 (where the text reads kira1ta-kulyau). Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v., takes the word, with Sa1yan2a, as an adjective, kira1ta-kula, ‘of the family of Kira1ta.’ The reading in the Br2haddevata1 (vii. 86) is kira1ta1kuli1. or Kila1ta and A1kuli according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 2) i. 1, 4, 14 (where the text reads kila1ta1kuli1). Cf. also Sa1t2ya1yanaka Bra1hman2a apud Sa1yan2a on Rv. x. 57, 1; 60, 1; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 167; Journal of the American Oriental Socicty, 18, 41 et seq.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 48, n. 1. No doubt the name is chosen, not as that of a historic person, but as a suitable designation of a hostile priest; for it is probably identical with the name of the mountaineers described in the preceding article.

किलात
किलात
 is the form of the name 2. Kira1ta that appears in the S4atapatha, S4a1t2ya1yanaka, and Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2as. 1) See note^2 under the preceding article.

किलास
किलास
 is the name of a disease, ‘white leprosy,’ in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 23, 24. and the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, etc. 2) xxx. 21; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 11, 11; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, v. 4, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 391; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 266; Jolly, Medicin, 98; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68. It resulted in the appearance of grey (palita) and white (s4ukla, s4veta) spots all over the skin. Haug gave the same sense to alasa in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 3) vi. 33, 5. but this is doubtful. The fem. Kila1si1 is taken by Max Mu7ller to mean a ‘spotted deer’ in one passage of the Rigveda. 4) v. 53, 1. 

कीकट
कीकट
 --The name of this people occurs only in one passage of the Rigveda, where they appear as hostile to the singer and as under the leadership of Pramaganda. Ya1ska 2) Nirukta, vi. 32. declares that Ki1kat2a was the name of a non-A1ryan country, and later 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Ki1kat2a is given as a synonym of Magadha. Hence Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 31, 118. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 58. concludes that the Ki1kat2as were a non-A1ryan people living in the country later known as Magadha. Weber 5) Indische Studien, 1, 186; Indian Literature, 79, n. *. holds that this people were located in Magadha, but were A1ryan, though at variance with other A1ryan tribes, perhaps because of heretical tendencies, for Magadha was later a seat of Buddhism. But the identification is uncertain, and is doubted by Oldenberg 6) Buddha, 402, 403; R2gveda-Noten, 1, 253. and Hillebrandt. 7) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-18. ^1 iii. 53, 14.

कीट
कीट
 is the name of a species of worm mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 4, 16. and frequently in the Upanis2ads. 2) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 19; 2, 14; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 9. 3; 10, 2; vii. 2, 1; 7, 1; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 2, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

कीनाश
कीनाश,
 a name of the ploughman or cultivator of the soil, is found in the Rigveda 1) iv. 57, 8. and the later Sam2hita1s. 2) Av. iv. 11, 10; vi. 30, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 8, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 237; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 45; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86, n. See Kr2s2i.

कीरि
कीरि
 is in the Rigveda 1) i. 31, 13; ii. 12, 6; v. 52, 12 (ki1rin2ah2; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 317). But see Geldner. Rigveda, Glossar, 46; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 223. a regular designation of the ‘poet.’ Cf. R2s2i.

कीर्शा
कीर्शा,
 the name of some kind of animal, or perhaps bird, is mentioned in the list of victims for the horse sacrifice (As4vamedha) in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 1) v. 5, 20, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

कीलाल
कीलाल,
 a word denoting a ‘sweet drink,’ is found in all the later Sam2hita1s, 1) Av. iv. 11, 10; 26, 6; 27, 5; vi. 69, 1; x. 6, 25; xii. 1, 59; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 12, 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 12; iii. 11, 3. 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 34; iii. 43; xx. 65; xxx. 11, etc. but not in the Rigveda. As the Sura1-ka1ra, ‘maker of Sura1,’ is dedicated in the list of victims in the human sacrifice 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 9, 1. (Purus2amedha) to Ki1la1la, it must have been a drink of somewhat the same nature as the Sura1 itself, possibly, as Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 281. suggests, a kind of rum.

कीश्मील
कीश्मील
 denotes, according to Bo7htlingk, 1) Dictionary, s.v. a certain disease in the Paippala1da recension of the Atharvaveda. 2) xix. 8, 4.

कीस्त
कीस्त
 in two passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 127, 7; vi. 67, 10. Cf. Ya1ska, Nirukta, iii. 15. means ‘poet,’ like Ki1ri.

कुक्कुट
कुक्कुट,
 ‘cock,’ occurs in the Yajurveda 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 16. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91. only. 2) It is common in the later language.

कुटरु
कुटरु
 is, according to the commentator Mahi1dhara, 1) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv, 23. synonymous with Kukkut2a, ‘cock.’ The word is found in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s only. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 1, 6; iii. 14, 4. 20; iv. 1, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 23, 39. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93.

कुण्डपायिन्
कुण्ड-पायिन्
 (‘drinking from a jug’) is the name of a teacher mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xxv. 4, 4. and in the Su1tras. 2) A1s4vala1yana Srauta Su1tra, xii. 4, 6; Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, xxiv. 4, 21. 

कुण्डपाय्य
कुण्ड-पाय्य
 (‘descendant of Kun2d2apa1yin’) is a patronymic connected with a man named S4r2n3gavr2s2 in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 17, 13. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90.

कुण्डृणाची
कुण्डृणाची
 is the name of an animal of unknown character occurring in the lists of victims at the horse sacrifice (As4vamedha) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 16, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 18; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 37. The word also occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 2) i. 29, 6. in which a bird would seem to be intended, though Sa1yan2a interprets it as meaning ‘with crooked flight’ (kut2ila-gatya1). In his commentary on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) v. 5, 16, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 89. he takes the word to denote the houselizard (gr2ha-godhika1).

कुत्स
कुत्स
 is the name of a hero frequently mentioned in the Rigveda, which, however, gives practically no information about him, for he was no doubt already a figure of the mythic past. He is several times 1) Rv. iv. 26, 1; vii. 19, 2; viii. 1, 11. called A1rjuneya, ‘descendant of Arjuna,’ and is usually 2) Rv. i. 63, 3; 121, 19; 174, 5; 175, 4; iv. 30, 4; v. 29, 4; vi. 20, 5; vii. 19, 2; x. 99, 9. associated with Indra in the exploit of defeating the demon S4us2n2a and winning the sun. He is said 3) Rv. x. 49, 4. to have defeated Smadibha, Tugra, and the Vetasus, but, on the other hand, he is several times 4) Rv. i. 53, 10; ii. 14, 7; viii. 53, 2. Cf. iv. 26, 1. mentioned with Atithigva and A1yu as being vanquished by Indra, his defeat in one passage 5) Rv. i. 53, 10. being attributed to Tu1rvaya1n2a. Elsewhere 6) Rv. i. 51, 6; vi. 26, 3. he appears with Atithigva as a friend of Indra's. In the later literature he is seldom 7) E.g., Av. iv. 29, 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 11, 26. mentioned except in connexion with the myth of his binding Indra, which is found in the Bra1hman2as, 8) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 2, 22; S4a1t2ya1yanaka in Sa1yan2a on Rv. x. 38, 5; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 228; Oertel. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 31. and which is based on an obscure verse in the Rigveda. 9) x. 38, 5. The Kutsas, or descendants of Kutsa, are mentioned in one hymn of the Rigveda. 10) vii. 25, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 113, 148; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 210, 211; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 284 et seq., who suggests that perhaps two Kutsas--one a friend of Indra, and the other a foe --may be distinguished; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 171; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 57, n. 1.

कुत्सऔरव
कुत्स औरव
 (‘son of Uru’) is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xiv. 6, 8. as having murdered his domestic priest (purohita), Upagu Saus4ravasa, because the father of the latter insisted on paying homage to Indra. This fact may be compared with the hostility to Indra of Kutsa according to certain passages of the Rigveda. 2) See Kutsa. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 284; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 57; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 32.

कुन्ति
कुन्ति
 --The Kuntis are referred to in an obscure and corrupt passage of the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 1) xxvi. 9. See Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 471, and cf. perhaps Maitra1yan2i1 am2hita1, iv. 2, 6. as having defeated the Pan5ca1las.

कुबेरवारक्य
कुबेर वारक्य
 is mentioned in a list of teachers in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 41, 1) as a pupil of Jayanta Va1rakya.

कुभा
कुभा
 is the name of a river mentioned twice in the Rigveda, 1) v. 53, 9; x. 75. 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. and no doubt identical with the modern Kabul river, the Greek .

कुभ्र
कुभ्र
 is the name of some animal in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (ii. 5, 3). 

कुमुद
कु-मुद
 is the name of a plant mentioned with other water plants in one passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 34. 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. It is no doubt the white water-lily (Nymphœa esculenta), being the name of that plant in post-Vedic Sanskrit also.

कुम्ब
कुम्ब
 is mentioned with Opas4a and Kuri1ra as an ornament of women's hair in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 138, 3. Geldner 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 131. thinks that, like those two words, it originally meant ‘horn,’ but this is very doubtful. Indian tradition 3) Sa1yan2a on Av. vi. 138, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 265; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 538, 539; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 348; Caland, U7ber das vituclle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 59. simply regards the term as denoting a female adornment connected with the dressing of the hair.

कुम्ब्या
कुम्ब्या
 or Kumvya1 is a word mentioned after R2c, Yajus, Sa1man, and Ga1tha1 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xi. 5, 7, 10. to denote a form of speech. In the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 2) ii. 3, 6. it appears as one of the forms of measured speech together with R2c and Ga1tha1. The precise meaning of the term is unknown. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 10, 111, n. Cf. Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 221; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44. 101. suggests the sense ‘refrain.’

कुम्भ
कुम्भ
 is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 7; 117, 6; vii. 33, 13, etc. as well as later, 2) Av. i. 6, 4; iii. 12, 7, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 87, etc. and denotes a ‘pot.’ Usually no doubt made of clay, it was easily broken. 3) Rv. x. 89, 7. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 367. See also Ukha1.

कुम्भीनस
कुम्भी-नस
 (‘pot-nosed’) is the name of an animal mentioned in the list of victims at the horse sacrifice (As4vamedha) in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 1) v. 5, 14, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s. v. Possibly some sort of snake is meant, as in the later literature. 

कुयवाच्
कुय-वाच्
 (‘evil-speaking’) appears in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 174, 7. to denote a demon slain by Indra, probably as a personification of the barbarian opponents of the A1ryans. The expression mr2dhra-va1c (‘speaking insultingly’) is similarly used of barbarians in the Rigveda. 2) v. 29, 10; 32, 8. See Dasyu.

कुरीर
कुरीर,
 like Opas4a and Kumba, denotes some sort of female head ornament in the description of the bride's adornment in the wedding hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 85. 8. and in the Atharvaveda. 2) vi. 138, 3. According to the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 5, 3: Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7. 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 56. the goddess Sini1va1li1 is described by the epithets su-kaparda1, su-kuri1ra, sv-opas4a1, as wearing a beautiful head-dress. According to Geldner, 4) Vedische Studien, 1, 131, 132. the word originally meant ‘horn’; but this is uncertain, as this sense is not required in any passage in which the term occurs. 5) Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 21 (= vaita1na Su1tra, xi. 22), cited by Geldner, is quite vague. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 265; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharanaveda, 539; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 348; Caland, U7ber das vituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 59.

कुरीरिन्
कुरीरिन्
 (‘having a Kuri1ra’) is a word occurring in an ambiguous passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 31, 2. in which it may be taken either as a noun meaning a ‘crested animal,’ perhaps as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 91. suggests the ‘peacock,’ or as an epithet of the word Aja, ‘goat,’ in which case it might mean ‘horned.’ But even in the latter alternative a metaphorical application of the word seems sufficient, just as in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 3) xiii. 4, 3. Opas4a is used of the horns of cattle, and thus renders unnecessary the adoption of Geldner's 4) Vedische Studien, 1, 130. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 457, 539; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 285; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 279. view that the original meaning of Kuri1ra is ‘horn.’ 

कुरु
कुरु
 --The Kurus appear as by far the most important people in the Bra1hman2a literature. There is clear evidence that it was in the country of the Kurus, or the allied KuruPan5ca1las, that the great Bra1hman2as were composed. 1) For the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 49, 50, with Weber, Indian Literature, 67, 68; for the Aitareya Bra1hman2a and the S4a1n3kha1yana Bra1hman2a, Weber, loc. cit., 45; for the Aitareya and Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yakas, Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 387; for the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, Weber, loc. cit., 132, Transactions of the Bcrlin Academy, 1895, 859. The Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a refers repeatedly to the Kuru-Pan5ca1las, whose name also occurs in the late and confused Gopatha Bra1hman2a. For the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, see i. 8, 4, 1. 2, and for the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 6. The Kurus are comparatively seldom mentioned alone, their name being usually coupled with that of the Pan5ca1las on account of the intimate connexion of the two peoples. The Kuru-Pan5ca1las are often expressly referred to as a united nation. 2) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, 6; 8, 7; iv. 7, 2; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 1; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, 1. 2, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 3, 3 (Ka1n2va recension). In the land of the Kuru-Pan5ca1las speech is said to have its particular home; 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 3, 15. the mode of sacrifice among the Kuru-Pan5ca1las is proclaimed to be the best; 4) Ibid., i. 7, 2, 8; cf. Kuru-va1japeya in Sa1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 3, 15; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 11, 18. the Kuru-Pan5ca1la kings perform the Ra1jasu1ya or royal sacrifice; 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 2, 3. 5. their princes march forth on raids in the dewy season, and return in the hot season. 6) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 1. 8, 4. 1, 2. Later on the Kuru-Pan5ca1la Brahmins are famous in the Upanis2ads. 7) Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 78; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 30, 6; iv. 6, 2; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 1, 1; 9, 20, etc. Weber 8) Indische Studien, 3, 470; Indian Literature, 114. and Grierson 9) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 602-607; 837-844. have sought to find traces in Vedic literature of a breach between the two tribes, the latter scholar seeing therein a confirmation of the theory that the Kurus belonged to the later stream of immigrants into India, who were specially Brahminical, as opposed to the Pan5ca1las, who were anti-Brahminical. In support of this view, Weber refers to the story in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 10) x. 6. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli. of a dispute between Vaka Da1lbhya and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra Vaicitravi1rya, the former being held to be by origin a Pan5ca1la, while the latter is held to be a Kuru. But there is no trace of a quarrel between Kurus and Pan5ca1las in the passage in question, which merely preserves the record of a dispute on a ritual matter between a priest and a prince: the same passage refers to the Naimis2i1ya sacrifice among the Kuru-Pan5ca1las, and emphasizes the close connexion of the two peoples. 11) See Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 831-836; 11381142. Secondly, Weber conjectures in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 12) xxiii. 18. that Subhadrika1 of Ka1mpila was the chief queen of the king of a tribe living in the neighbourhood of the clan, for whose king the horse sacrifice described in the Sam2hita1 was performed. But the interpretation of this passage by Weber is open to grave doubt; 13) Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 322. and in the Ka1n2va recension of the Sam2hita1 14) xi. 3, 3. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 114, note *. a passage used at the Ra1jasu1ya shows that the Kuru-Pan5ca1las had actually one king. Moreover, there is the evidence of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 15) xiii. 5, 4, 7. that the old name of the Pan5ca1las was Krivi. This word looks very like a variant of Kuru, and Zimmer 16) Altindisches Leben, 103. plausibly conjectures that the Kurus and Krivis formed the Vaikarn2a 17) vii. 18, 11. of the Rigveda, especially as both peoples are found about the Sindhu and the Asikni1. 18) Keith, loc. cit., 835. The Kurus alone are chiefly mentioned in connexion with the locality which they occupied, Kuruks2etra, We are told, however, of a domestic priest (Purohita) in the service of both the Kurus and the Sr2n5jayas, 19) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 4, 5. who must therefore at one time have been closely connected. 20) Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 123. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad reference is made to the Kurus being saved by a mare (as4va1), 21) iv. 17, 9: for as4va1 Bo7htlingk in his edition reads aks2n2a1, followed by Little, Grammatical Index, 1. and to some disaster which befel them owing to a hailstorm. 22) i. 10, 1. In the Su1tras, again, a ceremony (Va1japeya) of the Kurus is mentioned. 23) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 3, 15. There also a curse, which was pronounced on them and led to their being driven from Kuruks2etra, is alluded to. 24) Ibid., xv. 16, 11. Cf. Weber, Indian Literathre, 136. This possibly adumbrates the misfortunes of the Kauravas in the epic tradition. In the Rigveda the Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But mention is made of a prince, Kurus4ravan2a (‘Glory of the Kurus’), 25) Rv. x. 33, 4. and of a Pa1kastha1man Kauraya1n2a. 26) Rv. viii. 3, 21. In the Atharvaveda 27) xx. 127, 7 et seq.; Khila, v. 10. there occurs as a king of the Kurus Pariks2it, whose son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 28) xiii. 5, 4. as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice. It is a probable conjecture of Oldenberg's 29) Buddha, 403, 404. that the Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to by other names in the Rigveda. Kurus4ravan2a, shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Rigveda called Tra1sadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ who is well known as a king of the Pu1rus. Moreover, it is likely that the Tr2tsuBharatas, who appear in the Rigveda as enemies of the Pu1tus, later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people. 30) Ibid., 406-409. Since the Bharatas appear so prominently in the Bra1hman2a texts as a great people of the past, while the later literature ignores them in its list of nations, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that they became merged in some other tribe. Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Rigveda 31) iii. 23. as having kindled fire on the Dr2s2advati1, the A1paya1, and the Sarasvati1--that is to say, in the sacred places of the later Kuruks2etra. Similarly, the goddess Bha1rati1 (‘belonging to the Bharatas’) is constantly mentioned in the A1pri1 (‘propitiatory’) hymns together with Sarasvati1. 32) Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokr2yphen des R2gveda, 145. Again, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, one Bharata king was victorious over the Ka1s4is, 33) xiii. 5, 4, 11. and another made offerings to Gan3ga1 and Yamuna1, 34) Ibid., 21. while raids of the Bharatas against the Satvants are mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 35) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 25 (cf. Haug's edition, 2, 128, n. 3); Oldenberg, Buddha, 407, note*. Nor is it without importance that the Bharatas appear as a variant for the Kuru Pan5ca1las in a passage of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 36) xi. 3, 3. See note 14; Oldenberg, Buddha, 408, 409. and that in the list of the great performers of the horse sacrifice the names of one Kuru and two Bharata princes are given without any mention of the people over which they ruled, while in other cases that information is specifically given. 37) Oldenberg, 409, note*. The territory of the Kuru-Pan5ca1las is declared in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a to be the middle country (Madhyades4a). 38) viii. 14. Cf. Oldenberg, 392, 393. A group of the Kuru people still remained further north--the Uttara Kurus beyond the Hima1laya. It appears from a passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a that the speech of the Northerners-that is, presumably, the Northern Kurus--and of the KuruPan5ca1las was similar, and regarded as specially pure. 39) iii. 2, 3, 15. This is the sense which it appears to bear, as the KuruPan5ca1las can bardly be reckoned as being northerly (Oldenberg, 395), and the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, vii. 6 (Indische Studien, 2, 309) in independent evidence for the puro speech of the north. Cf. Eggeeling Sacred Books of the East, 12. xiii. Weber, Indian Literature, 45; Indische Studien, 1, 191. There seems little doubt that the Brahminical culture was developed in the country of the Kuru-Pan5ca1las, and that it spread thence east, south, and west. Traces of this are seen in the Vra1tya Stomas (sacrifices for the admission of non-Brahminical A1ryans) of the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 40) xvii. 1, 1. See also Av. xv. with Whitney's and Lanman notes; Weber, Ind the Studien, 1, 33 et seq.; Indian Literature, 67, 78, 80. and in the fact that in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka it is unusual for a Brahmin to dwell in the territory of Magadha. 41) vii. 13. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 400, note*; Weber, Indian Literature, 112, n. 126. The repeated mention of KuruPan5ca1la Brahmins is another indication of their missionary activity. 42) See e.g. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 4, 1, 2, and note 6. The geographical position of the Kuru-Pan5ca1las renders it probable that they were later immigrants into India than the Kosala-Videha or the Ka1s4is, 43) This is recognized, e.g., by Oldenberg, Buddha, 9, 391, 398, 399; Lanman, Sanskrit Keader, 297, etc. The narrative of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. (Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170), rather implies that the KosalaVidehas are offshoots of the KuruPan5ca1las, but Oldenberg and Macdonell (Sanskrit Literature, 214 interpret this as referring to the spread of Vedic tradition and culture, not of nationality. who must have been pushed into their more eastward territories by a new wave of A1ryan settlers from the west. But there is no evidence in Vedic literature to show in what relation of time the immigration of the latter peoples stood to that of their neighbours on the west. It has, however, been conjectured, 44) Cf. Grierson, Languages of India, 52 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 837 et seq. On the other hand, it is probably an error to assume that the Bharatas were originally situated far west of Kuruks2etra, and that the main action of the Rigveda was confined to the Panjab. When Vasis2t2ha celebrates the crossing of the Vipa1s4 and S4utudri1 (Rv. iii. 33), he probably came from the east, as Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218, points out, and not from the west. Adopting the ordinary view, Hopkins, India, Old and New, 52, finds it necessary to suggest that Yamuna1 is only another name in the Rv. for the Parus2n2i1. But the necessity for this suggestion, which is not in itself plausible, disappears when it is realized that the Bharatas held a territory roughly corresponding to Kuruks2etra, and bounded on the east by the Yamuna1. On the other hand, Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 142, 143. places the Kurus near the A1rji1ki1ya1 in Kas4mi1r, which puts them too far north. So also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 103, and Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xlii. It seems probable that the Kurus were at a very early period widely scattered to the north of the Hima1laya, in Kuruks2etra, and about the Sindhu and Asikni1. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 400 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 152-157; von Schroeder, Indiens Literature und Cultur, 164 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 187 et seq.; Indian Literature, 114, 135, 136; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 27; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 333 et seq.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 205, n. mainly on the ground of later linguistic phenomena, which have no cogency for the Vedic period, that the Kurus were later immigrants, who, coming by a new route, thrust themselves between the original A1ryan tribes which were already in occupation of the country from east to west. Cf. also Kr2tvan. For other Kuru princes see Kauravya.

कुरुक्षेत्र
कुरु-क्षेत्र
 (‘land of the Kurus’) is always regarded in the Bra1hman2a texts 1) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 13; xi. 5, 1, 4; xiv. 1, 1, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 30; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 4; iv. 5, 9; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 126 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxlvi); S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 16, 11, etc. as a particularly sacred country. Within its boundaries flowed the rivers Dr2s2advati1 and Sarasvati1, as well as the A1paya1. 2) Cf. Rv. iii. 23; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218. Here, too, was situated S4aryan2a1vant, 3) See Pischel, loc. cit., and cf. A1rji1ki1ya1. which appears to have been a lake, like that known to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a by the name of Anyatah2-plaks2a1. 4) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 1, 4. According to Pischel, there was also in Kuruks2etra a stream called Pastya1, 5) Pischel, loc. cit., 219. which he sees in certain passages of the Rigveda. The boundaries of Kuruks2etra are given in a passage of the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 6) v. 1, 1. These places cannot be further identified. See also Mara. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 164, 165; Max Mu1ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 398, 399; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78, 79; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 174. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli., seems to place Kuruks2etra, as lying between the Yamuna1 and Gan3ga1, too far east. as being Kha1n2d2ava on the south, the Tu1rghna on the north, and the Pari1n2ah on the west. Roughly speaking, it corresponded to the modern Sirhind.

कुरुङ्ग
कुरुङ्ग
 is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 4, 19; Nirukta, vi. 22. as a prince and a patron. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160. suggests that he was a king of the Anus, but for this theory there seems no good ground. As the Turvas4as are mentioned in the same verse, he may possibly have been one of their kings. The name suggests a connexion with the Kurus, and it may be noted that in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) xi. 5, 4, 16. See Oldenberg, Buddha, 404. the Turvas4as are connected with the Pan5ca1las (Krivis).

कुरु
कुरु
 -s4ravan2a Tra1sadasyava is alluded to as dead in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 33, 4. Cf. Br2haddevata1, vii. 35, 36. which refers also to his son Upamas4ravas, and his father Mitra1tithi. In another hymn 2) x. 32, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165: Geldner, Vediscke Studien, 2, 150, 184; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386. he is mentioned as still alive. His name connects him on the one hand with the Kurus, and on the other with Trasadasyu and the Pu1rus.

कुरूरु
कुरूरु,
 apparently the name of a species of worm, is mentioned twice in the Atharvaveda. 1) ii. 31, 2; ix. 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98. 

कुर्कुर
कुर्कुर
 is an onomatopoetic name for the dog in the Atharvaveda. 1) vii. 95, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 233. See also S4van.

कुल
कुल, कुल-पा
 --As an uncompounded word, Kula does not occur before the period of the Bra1hman2as. 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 22; ii. 1, 4, 4; 4, 1, 14; xi. 5, 3, 11; 8, 1, 3; xiii. 4, 2, 17; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 5, 32; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii., 13, 6, etc. It denotes the ‘home’ or ‘house of the family,’ and by metonymy the family itself, as connected with the home. The Kula-pa1 (lit. ‘house protector’), or chief of the family, is mentioned in the Rigveda 2) x. 179, 2. as inferior to and attendant on the Vra1japati in war, the latter being perhaps the leader of the village contingent of the clan. In the Atharvaveda 3) i. 14, 3. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 15; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athcrvaveda, 252, correcting Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 314. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 162. a girl is ironically called Kulapa1, because she is left without a husband in the world, and has only Yama (the god of death) for a spouse. The use of the term Kula points clearly to a system of individual families, each no doubt consisting of several members under the headship of the father or eldest brother, whose Kula the dwelling is. As distinct from Gotra, Kula seems to mean the family in the narrower sense of the members who still live in one house, the undivided family. Cf. Gr2ha, Gra1ma, Jana, Vis4.

कुलाल
कुलाल,
 the word denoting a ‘potter,’ occurs in the S4atarudriya, or litany to Rudra in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 27. Cf. kula1la-kr2ta, ‘made by a potter,’ Maitra1yan2i Sam2hita1, i. 8. 3, and Kaula1la.

कुलिश
कुलिश,
 ‘axe,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda as used for the making of chariots, 1) iii. 2, 1. and also in warfare, 2) i. 32. 5. while the Atharvaveda refers to its employment in cutting down trees. 3) ii. 12, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252. 

कुलीकय
कुलीकय
 is the form in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) v. 5, 13, 1. of the name of an animal, apparently a kind of fish, as explained by Mahi1dhara in his commentary, which is called Kuli1paya in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 2) xxiv. 21. 35. and Puri1kaya in the Atharvaveda, 3) xi. 2, 25. The commentator reads Puli1kaya, as in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 2. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 624. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96. variants probably due to the faulty tradition of an unfamiliar. name.

कुलीका
कुलीका
 is the name of a bird mentioned in the list of victims at the horse sacrifice in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 1) xxiv. 24. The Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 2) iii. 14, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94. has Puli1ka1 instead.

कुलुङ्ग
कुलुङ्ग
 is the name of an animal, perhaps a gazelle, mentioned in the list of victims at the horse sacrifice in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 11, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 9, 13 (with the variant Kulan3ga); Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 27. 32. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83.

कुल्मल
कुल्मल
 seems, in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 6, 5; v. 18, 15. the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 2) iii. 8, 1. 2. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) iii. 4, 4, 14. to denote the neck of an arrow in which the shaft is fixed.

कुमलबर्हिस्
कुमल-बर्हिस्
 is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xv. 3, 21) as the seer of a Sa1man or Chant.

कुमारहारित
कुमार हारित
 is mentioned in the first Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) ii. 5, 22 (Ma1dhyam2dina = ii. 6, 3, Ka1n2va). as a pupil of Ga1lava.

कुल्माष
कुल्माष,
 a word mentioned by the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 1) i. 10, 2. 7. in the plural, is interpreted by the commentator as ‘bad beans’ (kutsita1 ma1s2a1h2), a version adopted by Bo7htlingk in his Dictionary. 2) Cf. Bha1gavata Pura1n2a, v. 9. 12. where it is glossed ‘worm-eaten beans.’ Little 3) Grammatical Index, 52. renders it ‘sour gruel’ in accordance with the Nirukta. 4) i. 4.

कुल्या
कुल्या
 in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) iii. 45, 3; x. 43, 7. according to Muir, 2) Sanskrit Texts, 5, 465, 466. possibly refers to artificial watercourses flowing into a reservoir (hrada). See Avata.

कुवय

 See Kvayi.

कुवल
कुवल
 is a name of the jujube fruit (Zizyphus jujuba) occurring frequently in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 22, 89; xxi. 29; Ka1thaka Sam2hita1, xii. 10. and Bra1hman2as 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 10; xii. 7, 1, 2; 2, 9; 9, 1, 5, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 242. in connexion with Karkandhu and Badara. See also Kola.

कुश
कुश,
 a word later denoting the ‘sacred grass’ (Poa cynosuroides), is taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary to mean simply ‘grass’ in the passages of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a in which it occurs. ^1) ii. 5, 2, 15; iii. 1, 2, 16; v. 3, 2, 7, etc. Kus4a1 and Kus4i1 occur in Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 6, 2, 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 10, 1. 2, 7, apparently denoting pins of wood or metal, used as a mark in a special mode of recitation.

कुसर
कु-सर
 is mentioned with S4ara and other grasses in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. as affording lurking places for serpents.

कुशिक
कुशिक
 is the probably mythical forefather 1) Nirukta, ii. 25. of the Kus4ikas, and especially the father of the most important member of that family, Vis4va1mitra. 2) Rv. iii. 33, 5. The Kus4ikas are repeatedly referred to in the third Man2d2ala of the Rigveda, 3) iii. 26, 1; 29, 15; 30, 20; 33, 5; 42, 9; 50, 4; 53, 9. 10. and figure in the legend of S4unah2s4epa in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 4) vii. 18; Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xv. 27. They were clearly a family of priests who attached themselves to the service of the princes of the Bharatas. They were especially devoted to the worship of Indra; hence he is styled Kaus4ika even in the Rigveda. 5) i. 10, 11, with Sa1yan2a's note. Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 19; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 12, 4; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 62, 63. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, i, 38; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 342 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 101, 121; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 155; Oldenberg.

It is not clear whether he is identical with the Kus4ri of the last Vam2s4a of the Br2hada1ran2yaka 3) vi. 5, 4 (Ka1n2va only). in the Ka1n2va recension, and of the Vam2s4a in the tenth book of the S4atapatha, 4) x. 6, 5, 9. In the Vam2s4as the name is accented Ku4s4ri, but in x. 5, 5, 1, as Kus4ri1; no stress can, however, be laid on this. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 70; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxiii. who is mentioned as a pupil of Yajn5avacas Ra1jastamba1yana.

 is mentioned with S2an2d2a as a priest at the snake festival described in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 34; La1t2ya1yana S4ranta Su1tra, x. 20, 10.

कुषीतक
1. Kus2i1taka denotes, according to the commentary on the one passage of the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) v. 5, 13. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. in which it is found, the sea crow (samudra-ka1ka)

कुषीतकसामश्रवस
2. Kus2i1taka Sa1ma-s4ravasa is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xvii. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 34. as the Gr2hapati, or householder at a sacrificial session, of the Kaus2i1takis. 

कुषुम्भक
कुषुम्भक
 seems in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 16. The sense of ‘poisonbag’ is possible in i. 191, 15, and is accepted there by Bo7htlingk in his Dictionary. to mean a poisonous insect, Kus2umbha in th Atharvaveda 2) ii. 32, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 257. clearly having the sense of a poison bag. Sa1yan2a renders it as ‘ichneumon’ (nakula).

कुष्ठ
1. Kus2t2ha is the name of a plant (Costus speciosus or arabicus) 1) Or Saussurea auriculata, Hillebreandt. Vedische Mythologie, 1, 65. which is prominent in the Atharvaveda. 2) v. 4; vi. 102; xix. 139. It grew especially on the mountains, along with the Soma, on the high peaks of the Hima1laya (Himavant) where the eagles nest, and was thence brought east to men. 3) v. 4, 1. 2. 8; xix. 39, 1. Like Soma, it is said to have grown in the third heaven under the famous As4vattha tree, where the gods were wont to assemble, and thence it was brought in a golden ship. 4) v. 4, 3-6; vi. 75, 1. 2; xix. 39, 6-8. As a remedy, it held the highest place among herbs, being called by the auspicious names Nagha-ma1ra and Nagha1-ris2a, and styled the offspring of Ji1vala and Ji1vala1, the ‘lively’ ones. 5) v. 4, 1; xix. 39, 4. It cured headache (s4i1rs2a1maya), diseases of the eyes, bodily affliction, 6) v. 4, 10. but especially fever--hence called ‘feverdestroyer’ (takma-na1s4ana)--and consumption (Yaks2ma). From its general properties it was also named ‘all-healing’ (vis4vabhes2aja). 7) xix. 39, 9. Its aromatic qualities were apparently known, as it is classed with ‘salve’ (A1n5jana) and ‘nard’ (Nalada). 8) vi. 102, 3. Cf. Grohmann, Indische, Studien, 9, 420 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63, 64; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 415, 680; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 227, 228.

कुष्ठ
2. Kus2t2ha. --In one passage of the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 1) iii. 7, 7. Cf. Bo1htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. there is a series of fractions, Kala1, Kus2t2ha, S4apha, Pad, which appear to denote one-sixteenth, one-twelfth, one-eighth, and one-fourth respectively. 

कुसीदिन्
कुसीदिन्
 is a designation of the ‘usurer’ found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 4, 3, 11. and the Nirukta, 2) vi. 32. and often in the Su1tras. Jolly, 3) Recht und Sitle, 98, 99. referring doubtless to the expression kusi1da aprati1tta, 4) iii. 3, 8, 1. 2. ‘a loan not yet repaid,’ occurring in connexion with an-r2n2a, ‘free from debt,’ appears to be right in taking Kusi1da to have the sense of ‘loan’ in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. The rate of interest on loans is not specified before the Su1tra period. 5) E.g., Gautama Su1tra, xii. 29 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 259. Cf. R2n2a.

कुसुरुबिन्दऔद्दलकि
कुसुरुबिन्द औद्दलकि
 appears as an authority on ritual matters in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xxii. 15, 1. 10. the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 2) vii. 2, 2, 1. the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, 3) i. 75 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 327), where the reading seems to be Asurbinda. and the S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 4) i. 16. See Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 39. The name is there read as Kusurubindu; in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 22, 14 it is Kusurabindu. He may have been the brother of S4vetaketu, as suggested by Weber. 5) Indische Studien, 5, 61, n.

कूचक्र
कूचक्र
 is a word occurring only once in an obscure verse of the Rigveda, 1) x. 102, 11. where Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 157. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 14. suggests that it has the sense of the wheel by which water is raised from a well. Much more probable is the interpretation of Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. who understands it to mean the female breast.

कूट
कूट,
 a word found in the Rigveda, 1) x. 102, 4. the Atharvaveda, 2) viii. 8, 16. and the Bra1hman2as, 3) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 24; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 1, 15; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 49, 9; 50, 2 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 114). is of doubtful signification. On the whole, the most probable sense is hammer, 4) So Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 546; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 585. which suits every passage adequately. The St. Petersburg Dictionary renders it ‘horn,’ which is the sense accepted by Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 505. for the Atharvaveda passage where it occurs. Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 138; 2, 7. Cf. von Bradke, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 46, 458; Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 34, 156; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 222. thinks that it means ‘trap.’

कूदी
कूदी,
 written also Ku1t2i1 in the manuscripts, occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 19, 12. and the Kaus4ika Su1tra 2) Bloomfield's edition, xliv. Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 355; 12, 416; Roth, Festgrnss an Bo7htlingk, 98; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 254; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 165. denoting a twig--identified by the scholiast with Badari1, the jujube--which was tied to the bodies of the dead to efface their traces, presumably in order to render the return of the spirit to the old home difficult.

कूप
कूप
 occurs in the Rigveda 1) i. 105, 17. and later literature 2) Av. v. 31, 8; Satapatha Brahman2a, iii. 5, 4, 1; iv. 4, 5, 3; vi. 3, 3. 26, etc.; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 184. etc. The adjective ku1pya, ‘being in a hole,’ occurs frequently in the later Sam2hita1s. denoting an artificial hollow in the earth, or pit. In some cases they must have been deep, as Trita in the myth is said to have fallen into one from which he could not escape unaided. 3) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 67.

कूबर
कूबर
 in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (ii. 1, 11) and Ku1bari1 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (iv. 6, 9, 11. 12) and the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a (xxvii. 6) denote the pole of a cart.

कूर्च
कूर्च
 is found in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) vii. 5, 8, 5. and later 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 3, 4. 7; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 11, 1; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v, 1, 4. denoting a bundle of grass used as a seat. In one passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) xiii. 4, 3, 1. a golden Ku1rca is referred to. 

कूर्म
कूर्म,
 the ‘tortoise,’ is mentioned frequently in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Av. ix. 4, 16; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 3, 3; v. 2, 8, 4. 5; 7, 13, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 15, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 34, etc. and Bra1hman2as, 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 2, 3; vi. 1, 1, 12, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 153. but nothing is said of its characteristics. See also Kas4yapa.

कूशाम्बस्वायवलातव्य
कूशाम्ब स्वायव लातव्य
 is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) viii. 6, 8. as a priest. His name apparently means 2) The form is peculiar, as Kus4a1mba would be expected. Ku1s4a1mba, 3) Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2. of the La1tavya clan, son of Sva1yu.

कृकलास
कृकलास
 denotes the ‘chameleon’ mentioned in the list of sacrificial victims at the horse sacrifice in the Yajurveda 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 19, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 21; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 40. and later. 2) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 5, 22. The female chameleon, Kr2kala1si1, is also referred to in the Bra1hman2as. 3) Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 221 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 29), Sa1t2ya1yanaka in Sa1yan2a on Rv. viii. 91. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95. See Godha1 and S4ayan2d2aka.

कृकवाकु
कृक-वाकु,
 the ‘cock,’ being named in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 31, 2. Cf. x. 136, 10. with sheep, goats, and other domesticated animals, was presumably tamed. 2) Cf., however, Sa1yan2a on Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 18, 1, who says that it is a ‘forest’ Kukkut2a. In the list of victims at the horse sacrifice in the Yajurveda, 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, loc. cit.; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 15; Va1jasaneyi; Sam2hita1, xxiv. 35. it appears as dedicated to Savitr2: Ya1ska 4) Nirukta, xii. 3. explains this by the fact that it declares the time of day (ka1la1nuva1da). The commentator Mahi1dhara 5) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. explains the name by ta1mra-cu1d2a, ‘red-crested.’ It is of course onomatopoetic (‘calling kr2ka’). 6) Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 251; Weber, Indische Studien, 18. 285. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91. See also Kukkut2a.

 --From one passage in the Rigveda, 1) i. 168, 3. where the Maruts are described as having Kr2tis, Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 301. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 221. concludes that the word means a dagger used in war. But there is no evidence that Kr2ti was ever a human weapon. See Asi.

कृत्वन्
कृत्वन्
 --In one passage of the Rigveda 1) ix. 65, 23. the word Kr2tvan in the plural is mentioned with the A1rji1kas and the five peoples. Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 209. thinks that it means a people, and Sa1yan2a expressly says that the Kr2tvans designate a country. 3) Kr2tva1na iti des4a1bhidha1nam. The name in that case would point to some connexion with the Kurus or Krivis. Hillebrandt, 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 136, 137 however, thinks that the word is an adjective which qualifies A1rji1kas and designates this people as magicians, being applied to them by an opponent. In favour of this view, he quotes Hiouen Thsang's statement 5) Cunningham, Aneient Gevgraphy of India, 93. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. that the neighbouring kings held the base Kas4mi1rians in such scorn as to refuse all alliance with them, and to give them the name of Ki-li-to, or Kr2tyas. He suggests that the A1rji1kas settled in Kasmi1r in ancient times already had the same evil reputation as their successors in later days.

कृप
कृप
 is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 3, 12; 4, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. along with Rus4ama and S4ya1vaka, as a prote4ge4 of Indra.

कृमि
कृमि,
 ‘worm.’ In the later Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 11, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 11; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 30; Mantra Bra1hman2a, ii. 7; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iv. 36; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 1, 2; and of. Rv. i. 191. and especially in the Atharvaveda, 2) ii. 31. 32; v. 23. worms play a considerable part. They are regarded as poisonous, and are spoken of as found in the mountains, in forests, in waters, in plants, and in the human body. In accordance with widespread primitive ideas, they are considered to be the causes of disease in men and animals. The Atharvaveda contains three hymns 2) ii. 31, 32; v. 23. as charms directed against them. The first of these hymns is of a general character, the second is meant to destroy worms in cattle, and the third is intended to cure children of worms. When found in men, worms are said to have their place in the head and ribs, 3) Av. ii. 31, 4. and to creep into the eyes, nose, and teeth. 4) Av. v. 23, 3. They are described as dark brown, but white in the fore part of the body, with black ears, and as having three heads. 5) Av. v. 23, 4 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98, 393; Kuhn, Zeitschrift fu7r vergleichende Sprachforschung, 13, 49 et seq.; 113 et seq.; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 313 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 199; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 73. They are given many specific names: Ala1n2d2u, Ejatka, Kas2kas2a, Ki1t2a, Kuru1ru, Ni1lan3gu, Yeva1s2a, Vagha1, Vr2ks2asarpi1, S4aluna, S4avarta, S4ipavitnuka, Stega.

कृमुक
कृमुक
 is the name in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 1) xix. 10. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) vi. 6, 2, 11. of a species of wood used for fuel. 3) Ibid. (Kra1muha as applied to samidh).

कृश
कृश
 is mentioned with Sam2varta as a pious sacrificer to Indra in one of the Va1lakhilya hymns of the Rigveda 1) viii. 54, 2. and in another 2) viii. 59, 3. as a speaker of truth, while a third is traditionally 3) Indische Studien, 1, 293, n. ascribed to his authorship. He seems also to be mentioned with S4ayu as a prote4ge4 of the As4vins in another hymn of the Rigveda, 4) x. 40, 8. but here the word may merely denote the ‘feeble man.’ 5) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 132, 164. 

कृशन
कृशन,
 ‘pearl.’ In the Rigveda pearls are mentioned as adorning the car of Savitr2 1) i. 35, 4. as well as being used for the adornment of a horse. 2) x. 68, 1. Hence the horse is spoken of as the ‘pearled one’ (kr2s4ana1vant). 3) i. 126, 4. Cf. kr2s4anin, vii. 18, 23. The Atharvaveda 4) x. 1, 7. also refers to pearls, and mentions that ‘pearl shell’ (s4an5khah2 kr2s4anah2) won from the sea was used as an amulet. 5) iv. 10, 1. 3. The Nighan2t2u 6) i. 2. Cf. Sa1ma Mantra Bra1hman2a, 1, 6, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben,, 53, 54; Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 161. renders the word as ‘gold.’

कृशानु
कृशानु
 appears in the Rigveda as a mythological personage. 1) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 74, 112, 137; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 448. In one verse, 2) i. 112, 21. however, Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 4. sees in this word the name of a bowman, but there seems no reason to dissociate this passage from the rest.

कृषि
कृषि,
 ‘ploughing.’ The cultivation of the soil was no doubt known to the Indians before they separated from the Iranians, as is indicated by the identity of the expressions yavam2 kr2s2 and sasya in the Rigveda with yao karesh and hahya in the Avesta, referring to the ploughing in of the seed and to the grain which resulted. 1) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 235; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 85. But it is not without significance that the expressions for ploughing occur mainly in the first 2) Forms of the root kr2s2, ‘to plough,’ occur in Rv. i. 23, 15; 176, 2. and tenth 3) Rv. x. 34, 13; 117, 7. In x. 146, 6, akr2s2i1vala, ‘not agricultural,’ occurs. Cf. x. 101, 4. books of the Rigveda, and only rarely in the so-called ‘family’ books (ii.-vii.). 4) Kr2s2 is also found in viii. 20, 19; 22, 6; in the family books only in iv. 57, 4, and as vi-kr2s2 in iv. 57, 8. In the Atharvaveda Pr2thi1 Vainya is credited with the origination of ploughing, 5) viii. 10, 24. and even in the Rigveda the As4vins are spoken of as concerned with the sowing of grain by means of the plough. 6) i. 117, 21. In the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as ploughing is repeatedly referred to. 7) Kr2s2i is found, e.g., in Av. ii. 4, 5; viii. 2, 19; 10, 24; x. 6, 12; xii. 2, 27, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 11; 1, etc.; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 2, 2; iii. 6, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 10; ix. 27; xiv. 19. 21, etc.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 2, 2, 7; viii. 6, 2, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 2, 5, etc. In Av. vi. 116, 1, ka1rs2i1van2a denotes a ‘plougher.’ See also Ka1rs2man. Even in the Rigveda 8) x. 34, 13; 117, 7. Cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 208. there is clear proof of the importance attached to agriculture. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 9) xvii. 1. the Vra1tyas, Hindus without the pale of Brahminism, are described as not cultivating the soil. The plough land was called Urvara1 or Ks2etra; manure (S4akan, Kari1s2a) was used, and irrigation was practised (Khanitra). The plough (La1n3gala, Si1ra) was drawn by oxen, teams of six, eight, or even twelve being employed. 10) Av. vi. 91, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 2. Cf. Rv. viii. 6, 48; x. 101, 4. The operations of agriculture are neatly summed up in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 11) i. 6, 1, 3. as ‘ploughing, sowing, reaping, and threshing’ (kr2s2antah2, vapantah2, lunantah2, mr2n2antah2). The ripe grain was cut with a sickle (Da1tra, Sr2n2i), bound into bundles 12) viii. 78, 10; x. 101, 3; 131, 2. (Pars2a), and beaten out on the floor of the granary (Khala). 13) Rv. x. 48, 7. The grain was then separated from the straw and refuse either by a sieve (Titau) or a winnowing fan (S4u1rpa). 14) Rv. x. 71, 2; Av. xii. 3, 19. The technical terms are tus2air vi-vic, Av. xi. 1, 12; pala1va1n apa-vic, xii. 3, 19. The winnower was called Dha1nya1kr2t, 15) Rv. x. 94, 13. and the grain was measured in a vessel called Urdara. 16) Rv. ii. 14, 11. See also Sthivi. The Rigveda leaves us in doubt as to the kind of grain grown, for Yava is a word of doubtful signification, and Dha1na1 is also vague. In the later Sam2hita1s 17) See Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 12, for a list. things are different. Rice (Vri1hi) appears, Yava means barley, with a species styled Upava1ka. Beans (Mudga, Ma1s2a), sesamum (Tila), and other grains (An2u, Khalva, Godhu1ma, Ni1va1ra, Priyan3gu, Masu1ra, S4ya1ma1ka) are mentioned, while cucumbers (Urva1ru1, Urya1ru1ka) were known. It is uncertain whether fruit trees (Vr2ks2a) were cultivated, or merely grew wild; 18) The pulling of ripe fruit is referred to in Rv. iii. 45, 4. Cf. pakva1 s4a1kha1, Rv. i. 8, 8; vr2ks2a pakva, Rv. iv. 20, 5; Av. xx. 127, 4. But that does not prove arboriculture. but frequent mention is made of the jujube (Karkandhu, Kuvala, Badara.). The seasons for agriculture are briefly summed up in a passage of the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1: 19) vii. 2, 10, 2. barley ripened in summer, being no doubt sown, as in modern India, in winter; rice ripened in autumn, being sown in the beginning of the rains; beans and sesamum, planted at the time of the summer rains, ripened in the winter and the cool season. There were two harvests (Sasya) a year according to the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1; 20) v. 1, 7, 3. the winter crop was ripe by the month of Caitra (March-April) according to the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a. 21) xix. 3. Cf. Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 81, n. 1. The farmer had plenty of trouble of his own: moles destroyed the seed, birds and various kinds of reptiles (Upakvasa, Jabhya, Tarda, Patan3ga) injured the young shoots, excessive rain or drought might damage the crops. The Atharvaveda contains spells to prevent these evils. 22) See Av. vi. 50. 142; vii. 11. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 235243.

कृष्टि
कृष्टि
 denotes ‘people’ in general from the Rigveda 1) i. 52, 11; 100, 10; 160, 5; 189, 3; iii. 49, 1; iv. 21, 2, etc.; Av. xii. 1, 3. 4. onwards. Its common and regular use in this sense appears to show that the A1ryans, when they invaded India, were already agriculturists, though the employment of the words referring to ploughing mentioned under Kr2s2i indicates that not all of the people devoted themselves equally to that occupation. Indra and Agni are par excellence the lords of men (Kr2s2t2i). 2) i. 177, 1; iv. 17, 5; vii. 26, 5; viii. 13, 9 (Indra); i. 59, 5; vi. 18, 2; vii. 5, 5 (Agni). Sometimes the word is further defined by the addition of an adjective meaning ‘belonging to mankind,’ ‘of men’ (ma1nus2i1h2, 3) Rv. i. 59, 5; vi. 18, 2. ma1navi1h2). 4) Av. iii. 24, 3. Special mention is frequently 5) Rv. ii. 2, 10; iii. 53, 16; iv. 38, 10; x. 60, 4; 119, 6; 178, 3; Av. iii. 24, 2; xii. 1, 42. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 141. made of the ‘five peoples’ (pan5ca kr2s2t2ayah2). The exact sense of this expression is doubtful. See Panca Jana1sah2.

कृष्ण
1. Kr2s2n2a (‘black’) denotes a dark-coloured animal or bird. In some passages, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 6, 5; vi. 1, 3, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 1; iii. 2, 1, 28. So kr2s2n2a-vis2a1n2a1, ‘horn of the black antelope,’ ibid., iii. 2, 1, 18, 28; 2, 20; iv. 4, 5, 2; v. 4, 2, 5; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 3, 7. See also the As4vamedha passages, Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 17; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 36 (cf. ii. 1). as the context shows, an antelope is certainly meant. In a few others 2) Rv. x. 94, 5; Av. xi. 2, 2; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 27. a bird of prey seems indicated. See also Kr2s2n2a1jina.

कृष्ण
2. Kr2s2n2a appears as the name of a seer in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 85, 3. 4. Tradition assigns to him or to Vis4vaka, son of Kr2s2n2a (Ka1rs2n2i), the authorship of the following hymn. 2) viii. 86. The word Kr2s2n2iya may be a patronymic 3) i. 116, 23; 117, 7. formed from the same name in two other hymns of the Rigveda, 4) As a patronymic, it would be an isolated formation (cf. however Pajriya), instead of Ka1rs2n2ya. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 228a and 200. where the As4vins are said to have restored Vis2n2a1pu1 to Vis4vaka Kr2s2n2ya. In that case Kr2s2n2a would seem to be the grandfather of Vis2n2a1pu1. This Kr2s2n2a may be identical with Kr2s2n2a A1n3girasa mentioned in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a. 5) xxx. 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108; Macdonell, Vedia Mythology, p. 52.

कृष्णदेवकीपुत्र
3. Kr2s2n2a Devaki1-putra is mentioned in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 1) iii. 17, 6. as a pupil of the mythical Ghora A1n3girasa. Tradition, 2) Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 169. and several modern writers like Grierson, Garbe, and von Schroeder, recognize in him the hero Kr2s2n2a, who later is deified. In their view he is a Ks2atriya teacher of morals, as opposed to Brahminism. 3) Von Schroeder, Vienna Oriental Journal, 19, 414, 415; Grierson, Encyclopadia of Religions, article ‘Bhakti’; Garbe, Bhagavadgi1ta1. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 71; 148; Hopkins, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1905, 386. This is extremely doubtful. It appears better either to regard the coincidence of name as accidental, or to suppose that the reference is a piece of Euhemerism. To identify this Kr2s2n2a with the preceding, as does the St. Petersburg Dictionary, seems to be quite groundless.

कृष्णहारीत
4. Kr2s2n2a Ha1ri1ta is mentioned as a teacher in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka. 1) iii. 2. 6. The S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 2) viii. 10. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391, n.; Indian Literature, 50. has Kr2tsna in the parallel passage.

कृष्णल
कृष्णल
 denotes the berry of the Abrus precatorius, used as a weight according to the later authorities, one Ma1s2a (‘bean’) being equated to four Kr2s2n2alas. 1) Manu, viii. 134. In the sense of a weight it occurs in the Taittiri1va 2) ii. 3, 2, 1 et seq. and other Sam2hita1s, 3) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 4 (hiran2ya kr2s2n2ala). and later. 4) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 6, 7; Anupada Su1tra, ix. 6. In the later language it is also called raktika1 or gun5ja1 (being a smooth red berry with a black spot at one end). Cf. Weber's edition of the Jyotis2a, 82 et seq.; Indische Strcifen, 1, 102, 103.

 a term denoting a mess of rice and sesamum, often mentioned in the Su1tras, occurs in the S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) v. 2. Cf. Weber, Omina und Portenta, 315 et seq.

केकय
केकय
 is the name of a tribe which in later days, and probably also in Vedic times, was settled in the north-west, oetween the Sindhu (Indus) and Vitasta1. 1) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 317, 332. In the Vedic texts the Kekayas are mentioned indirectly only in the name of their prince As4vapati Kaikeya. 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 1, 2. et seq.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 11, 4. Cf. Weber, Indian Litenature, 120; Indische Studien, 1, 126.

केतु
1. Ketu is a term which Weber 1) Indische Studien, 1, 41. The arun2a1h2 ketavah2 (Av. xi. 10, 1. 2. 7), referred to in this sense in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, are not so treated by Bo7htlingk in his Dictionary. understands in the sense of ‘meteor’ or ‘comet’ in the late Adbhuta Bra1hman2a.

केतुवाज्य
2. Ketu Va1jya (‘descendant of Va1ja’) is mentioned as a teacher in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

केवर्त
केवर्त, कैवर्त
 are two variant forms denoting ‘fisherman’ in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xxx. 16, with Mahi1dhara's note. and Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 2) iii. 4, 12, 1, with Sa1yan2a's note. lists of victims at the Purus2amedha, or human sacrifice.

केश
केश,
 ‘hair of the head,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the later Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as. 1) Av. v. 19, 3; vi. 136, 3, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 22; xx. 5; xxv. 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 2, 48, etc. The hair was a matter of great care to the Vedic Indian, and several hymns of the Atharvaveda 2) vi. 136. 137. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 536, 537. are directed to securing its plentiful growth. Cutting or shaving (vap) the hair is often referred to. 3) Av. viii. 2, 17; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 3, 1, etc. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 425 et seq. For a man to wear long hair was considered effeminate. 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 2, 14. But cf. Vincent Smith, Indian Antiquary, 34, 203. As to modes of dressing the hair see Opas4a and Kaparda; as to the beard see S4mas4ru.

केशिन्
1. Kes4in is the name of a people occurring in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) xi. 8, 4, 6. Cf. Pa1nini, vi. 4, 165; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 131, 134. where their king is mentioned as learning from Khan2d2ika the atonement for a bad omen at the sacrifice. 

केशिन्दार्भ्य
2. Kes4in Da1rbhya 1) This is the form of the name in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, and the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a; also later in the Br2haddevata1. or Da1lbhya 2) This is the form in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. It also appears later in the Rigveda Anukraman2i1. (‘descendant of Darbha’) is a somewhat enigmatic figure. According to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) xi. 8, 4, 1 et seq., as explained by Sa1yan2a. and the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hmana 4) iii. 29, 1 et seq. he was a king, sister's son of Uccaih2s4ravas, according to the latter authority. His people were the Pan5ca1las, of whom the Kes4ins must therefore have been a branch, and who are said to have been threefold (tryani1ka). 5) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxx. 2 (Weber Indische Studien, 3, 471); Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, loc. cit.; Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xx. 25. A story is told of his having a ritual dispute with S2an2d2ika in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 6) i. 4, 12 (von Schroeder gives no variant reading; but s2 and kh are constantly confused in manuscripts). this appears in another form in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 3) xi. 8, 4, 1 et seq., as explained by Sa1yan2a. He was a contemporary of a fellow sage, Kes4in Sa1tyaka1mi, according to the Maitra1yan2i1 7) i. 6, 5. and Taittiri1ya 8) ii. 6, 2, 3. Sam2hita1s. The Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 9) xiii. 10, 8. attributes to him a Sa1man or chant, and the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 10) vii. 4. tells how he was taught by a golden bird. In view of the fact that the early literature always refers to Da1rbhya as a sage, it seems doubtful whether the commentator is right in thinking that the S4atapatha refers to a king and a people, when a sage alone may well be meant, while the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a is of no great authority. The latter work may have assumed that the reference in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 11) xxx. 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 193, 209; 2, 308; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 58, 59; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 62, n. 2. to the Kes4in people signifies kingship, but this is hardly necessary.

केशिन्सात्यकामि
3. Kes4in Sa1tya-ka1mi (‘descendant of Satyaka1ma’) is mentioned as a teacher and contemporary of Kes4in Da1rbhya in the Taittiri1ya (ii. 6, 2, 3) and Maitra1yan2i1 (i. 6, 5) Sam2hita1s. 

केसरप्राबन्धा
केसर-प्राबन्धा
 --In the list of the crimes of the Vaitahavyas narrated in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 18, 11. is the cooking of the last she-goat (carama1ja1m) of Kesarapra1bandha1, who may presumably be deemed to have been a woman, ‘having braided hair.’ 2) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 432, 433. Ludwig, 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 447. followed by Whitney, 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 252. appears to amend the passage (carama-ja1m) as meaning ‘the last-born calf’ of Kesarapra1bandha1, a cow. But this interpretation does not suit the name so well.

कैकेय
कैकेय,
 ‘king of the Kekayas,’ is an epithet of As4vapati. 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 1, 2; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 11, 4.

Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 134. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 208. or as extinct.

कैशोर्य
कैशोर्य,
 ‘descendant of Kais4ori,’ is the patronymic of Ka1pya in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Ma1dhyam2dina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Ka1n2va). 

कोक
1. Koka, a word occurring in the Rigveda 1) vii. 104, 22 (koka-ya1tu, a ghost in the shape of a cuckoo). and the Atharvaveda, 2) v. 23, 4; viii. 6, 2. seems to denote the ‘cuckoo.’ In all the three passages in which it is found, Sa1yan2a explains it as the Cakrava1ka. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 6. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 454; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 262; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 49; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92. renders it in the Atharvaveda passages as a certain destructive parasitic animal. Cf. Anyava1pa.

कोक
2. Koka is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xiii. 5, 4, 17) as a son of the Pan5ca1la king, Sa1tra1sa1ha.

कोकिल
कोकिल,
 a very frequent word in the Epic and later, denoting the cuckoo, is only inferred for the Vedic period from its being the name of a Ra1japutra in the Ka1t2haka Anukraman2i1. 1) Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 460.

 another form of Kuvala, the Zizyphus jujuba, is mentioned in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (vii. 3, 1).

कोश
1. Kos4a is the name in the Rigveda 1) i. 130, 2; iii. 32, 15; iv. 17, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 156. for the ‘bucket’ used in drawing water by means of a rope from a well (Avata). In the ritual 2) Rv. ix. 75. 3; Av. xviii. 4. 30, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 183 et seq. it denotes a large vessel to hold Soma, as opposed to Kalas4a.

कोश
2. Kos4a denotes the body of a chariot. 1) Rv. i. 87, 2; x. 85, 7, etc. Presumably it was fastened to the axles, but it was probably not very secure, as the body of Pu1s2an's chariot is said not to fall. 2) Rv. vi. 54, 3. The ropes 3) Ga1vah2, Rv. viii. 48, 5. used to fasten the Kos4a are perhaps referred to in the word aks2a1-nah. 4) See under 1. Aks2a. By synecdoche this word also denotes the whole chariot. 5) Rv. viii. 20, 8; 22, 9. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 246. See also Vandhura, Ratha. 

कोश
3. Kos4a. --The exact sense of this word in Kos4a-ka1ri1, the designation of a female victim at the Purus2amedha, or human sacrifice, 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 14; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 10, 1. is uncertain. It may be ‘sheath.’

कोष
कोष
 --The Kos2as appear as a priestly family in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, where one of them, Sus4ravas, is mentioned by name. 2) x. 5, 5, 1. ^1 x. 5, 5, 8.

कोसल
कोसल
 is the name of a people not occurring in the earliest Vedic literature. In the story of the spread of A1ryan culture told in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) i. 4, 1, 1 et seq. the Kosala-Videhas, as the offspring of Videgha Ma1thava, appear as falling later than the Kuru-Pan5ca1las under the influence of Brahminism. The same passage gives the Sada1ni1ra1 as the boundary of the two peoples --Kosala and Videha. Elsewhere 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 4. Cf. Hiran2ya-na1bha, a Ra1japutra, in Pras4na Upanis2ad, iii. 2, and S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 9, 13, as a Kausalya, while ibid., 11, Para is styled Vaideha. the Kausalya, or Kosala king, Para A1t2n2a1ra Hairan2yana1bha, is described as having performed the great As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice. Connexion with Ka1s4i and Videha appears also from a passage of the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra. 3) xvi. 29, 5. Weber 4) Indische Studien, 1, 182, 441. points out that A1s4vala1yana, who was very probably a descendant of As4vala, the Hotr2 priest of Videha, is called a Kosala in the Pras4na Upanis2ad. 5) vi. 1. The later distinction of North and South Kosala is unknown to both Vedic and Buddhist literature. 6) Oldenberg, Buddha, 393, n. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 167; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xlii; Weber, Indian Literature, 39, 132 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 213-215; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 25. Kosala lay to the north-east of the Ganges, and corresponded roughly to the modern Oudh.

कौकूस्त
कौकूस्त
 is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) iv. 6, 1, 13. as a giver of a Daksin2a1, or gift to the priests officiating at a sacrifice. The Ka1n2va recension reads the name Kau7kthasta. 2) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 426, n. 1. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 134.

Neither Vam2s4a is of much value. 3) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxiv.

कौतस्त
कौतस्त,
 a word occurring once in the dual, is apparently a patronymic of Arimejaya and Janamejaya, two Adhvaryu priests at the snake sacrifice described in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

A Kautsa is also attacked in the Nirukta 2) i. 15. as denying the value of the Vedas, and there is a strong ritual tradition of hostility to the Kautsas. 3) E.g., A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, x. 20, 12; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 285.

कौरु-पञ्चाल,
 ‘belonging to the Kuru-Pan5ca1las,’ is an epithet of A1run2i in the S4atapatha Bra1hmana (xi. 4, 1, 2), and a practice of those tribes is designated by this word in the same work (i. 7, 2, 8).

कौलितर
कौलितर
 is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) iv. 30. 14. as a Da1sa. Apparently the name is an epithet of S4ambara, meaning ‘son of Kulitara’: this points to S4ambara having been a terrestrial foe, and not a mere demon. 2) Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 273; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 64, 161.

The name is also found later (in the Epic) in the form of Kus4a1mba. It is, however, possible that the word means a ‘native of the town Kaus4a1mbi1’ as understood by Harisva1min in his commentary on the S4atapatha Bra1hmana. 3) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 153, n. 5.

क्रतु-विद् जानकि
 (‘descendant of Janaka’) is mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (vii. 34) as having learned a certain doctrine regarding Soma from Agni.

क्रय
क्रय,
 ‘sale,’ is a word which does not actually occur in the Rigveda, though the verb kri1, from which this noun is derived, is found there. 1) iv. 24, 10. Both noun and verb are common in the later Sam2hita1s. 2) Kraya: Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 2, 1; vi. 1, 3, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 55; xix. 13; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 2, 10, etc.; kri1: Av. iii. 15, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 10, 3; vii. 1, 6, 2, etc.; apa-kri1: Av. viii. 7, 11; pari-kri1: Av. iv. 7, 6, etc.; vi-kri1: Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 49, etc. Sale appears to have regularly consisted in barter in the Rigveda: 3) iv. 24, 10. ten cows are regarded as a possible price for an (image of) Indra to be used as a fetish, while elsewhere not a hundred, nor a thousand, nor a myriad are considered as an adequate price (s4ulka) for the purchase of Indra. 4) Rv. viii. 1, 5. The Atharvaveda 5) iv. 7, 6. mentions, as possible objects of commerce, garments (du1rs4a), coverlets (pavasta), and goatskins (ajina). The haggling of the market was already familiar in the days of the Rigveda, 6) iv. 24, 9. See Oldenberg, R2gvedaNoten, 1, 419, 420, correcting Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 91, and Geldner's Kommentar on iv. 24. and a characteristic hymn of the Atharvaveda 7) iii. 15. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 352; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 111, 112. is directed to procuring success in trade. The ‘price’ was called Vasna, and the ‘merchant’ Van2ij. his greed being well known. 8) Rv. i. 33, 3, and See Pan2i. There is little evidence of a standard of value in currency having been adopted. When no specific mention is made of the standard, the unit was probably the cow. 9) Cf. Harisva1min on Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 2, 1, where he renders sahasra1rha as equal to ‘worth a thousand cows,’ in which Eggeling follows him; Sam2ks2iptasa1ra on Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 10, 33. In a considerable number of passages of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 10) xii. 7, 2, 13; 9, 1, 4; xiii. 1, 1, 4; 2, 3, 2; 4, 1, 13; xiv. 3, 1, 32. Cf. v. 5, 5, 16; xiii. 4, 1, 6. and elsewhere, 11) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xviii. 3, 2, where a long series of compounds of numerals with -ma1na occurs; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 5; xiv. 8; xxii. 8. however, the expression hiran2yam2 s4ata-ma1nam suggests that there must have been some standard other than cows, though it might in all these passages be rendered as ‘gold worth a hundred cows.’ But the use of the Kr2s2n2ala as a measure of weight 12) Cf. Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 6, 7; Anupada Su1tra, ix. 6: Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 99-103. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 255260. Barter had for the most part passed away by the time of the Ja1takas, an illustration of the modern character of the society they represent. See Mrs. Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, 874 et seq. suggests that the meaning is ‘gold weighing a hundred Kr2s2n2alas,’ and this seems the more probable explanation. This unit seems not to be known in the Rigveda, where the meaning of the term Mana1, which occurs once, is mysterious, and where necklets (Nis2ka) seem to have been one of the more portable forms of wealth, like jewellery in modern India, and may perhaps have served as a means of exchange.

क्रवण
क्रवण,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) v. 44. 9. is understood by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. as the name of the Hotr2 priest or the sacrificer. Roth considered it an adjective without at first 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. assigning a sense, but afterwards 4) Bo7htlingk's Dictionary, s.v. as meaning ‘timid.’ Sa1yan2a interprets it as ‘worshipping.’ Oldenberg 5) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 342. considers the meaning uncertain, suggesting as possible ‘the slayer of the victim.’

क्रव्य
क्रव्य,
 ‘raw flesh,’ is never mentioned in Vedic literature as eaten by men. Demons alone are spoken of as consuming it, 1) Rv. vii. 104, 2; x. 87, 2. 19; 162, 2; Av. iii. 28, 2; iv. 36, 3: v. 29 10, etc. apart from Agni being called kravya1d, ‘eating raw flesh,’ as consumer of the bodies of the dead. 2) Rv. x. 16, 9. 10. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 97, 165. The man who in the Rigveda is compelled by starvation to eat dog's flesh, nevertheless cooks it. 3) iv. 18, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 270, 271.

क्रातुजातेय
क्रातु-जातेय
 is a patronymic of Ra1ma Kra1tuja1teya Vaiya1ghrapadya in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 40, 2; iv. 16, 1).

क्रिमि
क्रिमि
 See Kr2mi. 

क्रिवि
क्रिवि
 is asserted in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 5, 4, 7. to have been the older name of the Pan5ca1las. This statement is supported by the name of the king there mentioned, Kraivya Pa1n5ca1la, The Krivis appear in the Rigveda 2) viii. 20, 24; 22, 12. ElsewhereKrivi is doubtful in sense. In several passages (i. 30, 1; viii. 87, 1; ix. 9, 6, and perhaps i. 166, 6, where krivir-dati1 is an epithet of lightning) Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, i. 166, 341, understands the word to mean ‘horse.’ Elsewhere (ii. 17, 6; 22, 2; viii. 51, 8) he takes it to be a proper name, while in v. 44, 4, he is doubtful. In the passages last cited this view may very well be correct. as settled on the Sindhu and the Asikni1. It is a plausible conjecture of Zimmer's 3) Altindisches Leben, 103. that with the Kurus they made up the Vaikarn2a people. 4) Cf. Kavas2a. The importance of the Pan5ca1las, and the insignificance of the Krivis, may be explained in part by the fact that the later Kuru-Pan5ca1la alliance included the Bharatas. It is also probable, as Oldenberg 5) Buddha, 404. suggests, from the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 6) xiii. 5, 4, 16. that the Turvas4as were included in the Pan5ca1las, and as the latter name indicates, probably other tribes also. Or, if Hopkins' view 7) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 258 et seq. This view is hardly convincing, while the disappearance of the Turvas4as is easily to be accounted for by their being merged, along with the Krivis, in the Pan5ca1las. The name of Krivi is lost in the Epic as completely as that of Turvas4a (Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 48, notes 4, 5). Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 155, 157; Grierson, Journal of the Royal Astatic Society, 1908, 602-607; Keith, ibid., 831 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152, 153; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli.; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 407. is accepted that Turvas4a was king of the Yadus, the latter may in part have been allied with the Krivis to form the Pan5ca1las.

क्रीतवैतहोत्र

It is doubtless invented to explain the name of the Chant on the ordinary principle that Sa1mans are called after their authors, though this rule has many exceptions. 2) Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160.

क्रुमु
क्रुमु
 is the name of a stream mentioned twice in the Rigveda--once in the fifth book 1) v. 53, 9. and once in the last, in the Nadi1-stuti, or ‘praise of rivers.’ 2) x. 75, 6. There can be little doubt that this river is identical with the modern Kurum, a western tributary of the Indus. 3) Roth, Nirukta, Erla7uterungen, 43; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14: Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200.

क्रैव्य
क्रैव्य। पाञ्चाल,
 the king of the Krivis, 1) So the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Weber, Indian Literature, 125, n.; Oldenberg, Buddha, 409, n. is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 5, 4, 7. as having performed the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, on the Parivakra1. Eggeling, 3) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 397 (but cf. p. 398, top). however, takes the word as a proper name, ‘Kraivya, the Pa1n5ca1la king.’

क्रोश
क्रोश,
 as a measure of distance (lit. ‘a shout,’ as expressing the range of the voice), is found in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xvi. 13, 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 8, 432 et seq. In the later literature it is equivalent to about two miles. The word still survives in the vernacular form of Kos as the most popular measure of distance in India. 

क्रोष्टृ
क्रोष्टृ
 (lit. ‘howler’), the ‘jackal,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 28, 1. as by nature cowardly compared with the wild boar (Vara1ha). In the Atharvaveda 2) xi. 2, 2. it is spoken of as devouring corpses. The word also occurs in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 3) xxiv. 32. Cf.

2. Kraun5ca, as the name of a mountain, occurs only in the latest Vedic literature. 1) Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 31, 2. See Weber, Indian Literature, 93; Indische Studien, 1, 78.

क्रौञ्चिकीपुत्र
क्रौञ्चिकी-पुत्र,

क्वयी
क्वयी
 is the name of some species of bird in the Yajurveda, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 17, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 29. occurring in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice. The form in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 2) iii. 14, 18. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99 is Kuvaya. 

क्वल
क्वल
 is a substance, perhaps 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. identical with Kuvala, the fruit of the jujube, used to coagulate milk according to the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 2) ii. 5, 3, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227.

क्षत
क्षत
 is regarded by Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 377. as denoting a special disease (a sort of Phthisis pulmonalis) in the Atharvaveda, 2) vii. 76, 4 (where the reading is doubtful, the text having aks2ita. See Aks2ata). but the word is probably only an adjective. 3) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 509; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 442.

क्षत्तृ
क्षत्तृ
 is a word of frequent occurrence in the later Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as, denoting a member of the royal entourage, but the sense is somewhat uncertain. In the Rigveda 1) vi. 13, 2. it is used of a god as the ‘distributor’ of good things to his worshippers; the same sense seems to be found in the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 24, 7; v. 17, 4. and elsewhere. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 6; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 9, 16. In one passage of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 4) xxx. 13. Cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 3, 5. the interpretation ‘doorkeeper’ is given by the commentator Mahi1dhara, a sense which seems possible in other passages, 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 4, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xix. 1, 4. while Sa1yan2a ascribes to it in one passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 6) v. 3, 1, 7. Cf. on xiii. 4, 2, 5 (a1yavyaya1dhyaks2a), and Harisva1min on xiii. 5, 4, 6 (kos4a1dhyaks2a). The scholiast on the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 3, 9. has mantri1 du1to va1; on xx. 1, 16, prati1ha1ro du1to va1. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 61, etc., renders it ‘chamberlain.’ the more dignified meaning of antah2pura1dhyaks2a, ‘a chamberlain.’ In other passages, 7) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 26; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 7, 1, with the scholiast's note, and ibid., anuks2attr2, rendered as sa1rather anucara, ‘the attendant of the charioteer’; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 1, 20, with the scholiast's note. again, the sense of ‘charioteer’ is not unlikely. Later the Ks2attr2 was regarded as a man of mixed caste. 8) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 481. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 36; 17, 290; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

क्षत्र
1. Ks2atra, in the general sense of ‘dominion,’ ‘rule,’ ‘power,’ as exercised by gods and men, occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) i. 24, 11; 136, 1. 3; iv. 17. 1; v. 62, 6, etc.; Av. iii. 5, 2; v. 18, 4, etc. So ks2atra-s4ri1, Rv. i. 25, 5; vi. 26. 8; ks2atra-bhr2t, ‘bringers of lordship.’ Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 7, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 6, 12; 7, 6, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxvii. 7, etc. onwards. The word is also found in the concrete sense of ‘rulers’ in the Rigveda 2) Singular: i. 157, 2; viii. 35, 17. and later; 3) Plural: Av. iv. 22, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 17; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 6, 3. but in no case does it in the Rigveda certainly 4) See Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Varn2a. mean what it regularly denotes in the later Sam2hita1s, 5) Av. ii. 15, 4: ix. 7, 9; xii. 5, 8; xv. 10, 5, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 1, 2; ii. 2, 11, 2, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, v. 27; xiv. 24; xviii. 38, etc. See other citations under Varn2a. the ruling class as opposed to the priests (Brahman), the subject people (Vis4, Vais4ya), and the servile class (S4u1dra). See also Ks2atriya. A Ks2atra-pati is several times mentioned 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 14, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 17; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 8, 5; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 2, 2. as an equivalent of ‘king.’

क्षत्र
2. Ks2atra seems to be the name of a man mentioned with others, including Manasa, Yajata, and Avatsa1ra, in one quite obscure passage of the Rigveda. 1) v. 44, 10. Cf. Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138.

क्षत्रविद्या
क्षत्र-विद्या,
 ‘the science of the ruling class,’ is mentioned in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 1) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. S4an3kara glosses the term with dhanur-veda, ‘the science of the bow,’ which is the most probable sense. 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 104.

 --As the origin of caste, the relation of the castes, intermarriage, and cognate matters may most conveniently be discussed under Varn2a, this article will be confined to determining, as far as possible, the real character of the class called Ks2atriyas, or collectively Ks2atra. The evidence of the Ja1takas 1)See Fick, Die sociale Gliederung im nordo7stlichen Indien zu Buddhas Zoit, 59 et seq.; Rhys Davids, Dialogues of the Buddha, 1, 95 et seq.; Buddhist India, 52 et seq. points to the word Khattiya denoting the members of the old A1ryan nobility who had led the tribes to conquest, as well as those families of the aborigines who had managed to maintain their princely status in spite of the conquest. In the epic 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 73 et seq. also the term Ks2atriya seems to include these persons, but it has probably a wider signification than Khattiya, and would cover all the royal military vassals and feudal chiefs, expressing, in fact, pretty much the same as the barones of early English history. Neither in the Ja1takas 3) Fick, op. cit., 52, n. 2. nor in the epic 4) Hopkins, op. cit., 184 et seq., 190. is the term co-extensive with all warriors; the army contains many besides the Ks2atriyas, who are the leaders or officers, rather than the rank and file. In the later Sam2hita1s 5) Av. vi. 76, 3. 4; xii. 5, 5. 44. 46, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5, etc. See Varn2a and Ra1janya. and the Bra1hman2as 6) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 24, etc.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 2, 15; iv. 1, 4, 5. 6, etc. See Varn2a. the Ks2atriya stands as a definite member of the social body, distinct from the priest, the subject people, and the slaves, Bra1hman2a, Vais4ya, and S4u1dra. It is significant that Ra1janya is a variant to Ks2atriya, and an earlier one. Hence it is reasonable to suppose that the Ks2atriya and Ra1janya are both of similar origin, being princely or connected with royalty. Moreover, the early use of Ks2atriya in the Rigveda 7) iv. 12, 3; 42, 1; v. 69, 1; vii. 64, 2; viii. 25, 8; 56, 1; x. 109, 3. Cf. Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 19; x. 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 7, 7. is exclusively connected with royal authority or divine authority. It is impossible to say exactly what persons would be included in the term Ks2atriya. That it covered the royal house and the various branches of the royal family may be regarded as certain. It, no doubt, also included the nobles and their families: this would explain the occasional opposition of Ra1janya and Ks2atriya, as in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 8) vii. 20. Cf. Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 18, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xx. 1. where a Ra1janya asks a Ks2atriya for a place for sacrifice (deva-yajana). Thus, when strictly applied, Ks2atriya would have a wider denotation than Ra1janya. As a rule, however, the two expressions are identical, and both are used as evidence in what follows. That Ks2atriya ever included the mere fighting man has not been proved: in the Rigveda 9) In the following passages there is reference to the people (vis4) fighting: i. 69, 3; 126, 5 (cf., however, Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 121); iv. 24, 4; vi. 26, 1; vii. 79, 2; viii. 18, 18; 96, 15; probably also vii. 33, 6, where the Tr2tsu1na1m2 vis4ah2 means ‘the subjects of the Tr2tsu princes,’ as Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 136, thinks. In vi. 41, 5, on the other hand, the people and wars (pr2tana1su) are contrasted, the normal rule of the common folk being peace. and later 10) In Av. ix. 7, 9, the people are clearly designated as balam, or ‘force,’ a regular term later for an armed force. The later law books (e.g., Gautama, vii. 6; Vasis2t2ha, ii. 22) allow even Brahmins to maintain themselves by the occupation of Ks2atriyas in case of need. For the Epic, cf. Hopkins, op. cit., 94, 95; 184 et seq. others than Ks2atriyas regularly fought; but possibly if the nobles had retinues as the kings had, Ks2atriya would embrace those retainers who had military functions. The term did not apply to all members of the royal entourage; for example, the Gra1man2i1 was usually a Vais4ya. The connexion of the Ks2atriyas with the Brahmins was very close. The prosperity of the two is repeatedly asserted 11) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 10, 3; Maitrayan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 3; iii. 1, 9; 2, 3; iv. 3, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxix. 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, v. 27; vii. 21; xviii. 14; xix. 5; xxxviii. 14, etc.; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xi. 11, 9; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 22; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 1, 7; iii. 5, 2, 11; 6, 1, 17; vi. 6, 3, 14. The superiority of the Ra1janya to all other castes is asserted in Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 10, 1, etc. The superiority of the Brahmin to the Ks2atriya is sometimes asserted--e.g., in the Atharvaveda hymns, v. 18. 19; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 21; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 1, 9, 1; 3, 7, 8. So the Ra1jasu1ya sacrifice of the king is inferior to the highest sacrifice (the Va1japeya) of the priest (ibid., v. 1, 1, 12), and though the Brahmin goes after the king, he is yet stronger than he (v. 4, 2, 7, and v. 4, 4, 15). Cf. Hopkins, op. cit., 76. to be indissolubly associated, especially in the relation of king (Ra1jan) and domestic priest (Purohita). Sometimes there was feud between Ks2atriya and Brahmin. 12) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 5; Av. v. 18. 19. His management of the sacrifice then gave the Brahmin power to ruin the Ks2atriya by embroiling him with the people 13) E.g., Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 11, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 5; ii. 1, 9; iii. 3, 10; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxix. 8, etc. or with other Ks2atriyas. 14) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 10, etc. Towards the common people, on the other hand, the Ks2atriya stood in a relation of well-nigh unquestioned superiority. 15) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 4; xxi. 10; xxii. 9; xxix. 9. 10; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 33; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 2, 7, 15. 16, etc.; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 9. 10; 6, 8, etc. There are, however, references to occasional feuds between the people and the nobles, 16) Cf. note 13; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 4, 6, 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 7. in which no doubt the inferior numbers of the latter were compensated by their superior arms and prowess. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 17) vii. 29. Cf. Ra1jan. the Vais4ya is described as tributary to another (anyasya bali-kr2t), to be devoured by another (anyasya1dya), and to be oppressed at will (yatha1ka1ma-jyeya). Probably these epithets apply most strictly to the relation of the king and his people, but the passage shows that the people were greatly at the mercy of the nobles. No doubt the king granted to them the right, which may have been hereditary, to be supported by the common people, whose feudal superiors they thus became. In return for these privileges the Ks2atriyas had probably duties of protection to perform, as well as some judicial functions, to judge from an obscure passage of the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 18) xxvii. 4 (tasma1d ra1janyena1dhyaks2en2a vais4yam2 ghnanti, ‘so with a Ra1janya as a supervisor[?] they smite a Vais4ya’). It is not clear whether han here means ‘kill’ or ‘beat.’ The main duty of the Ks2atriya in the small states 19) See Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30, n. 2. of the Vedic period was readiness for war. The bow is thus his special attribute, 20) Av. xviii. 2, 60; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xviii. 9; xxxvii. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 5, 30; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, vi. 1, 3. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 19, the list is longer--chariot, breastplate (Kavaca), bow and arrow (is2u-dhanvan)--and in the prayer for the prosperity of the Ks2atriya (called, as usual in the older texts, Ra1janya), at the As4vamedha, the Ra1janva is to be an archer and a good chariot-fighter; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 18, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 12, 6; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, As4vamedha, v. 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 2. So Indra is the god of the Ks2atriyas, Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 1; iv. 5, 8, etc. just as the goad is that of the agriculturist; for the bow is the main weapon of the Veda. Whether the Ks2atriyas paid much attention to mental occupations is uncertain. In the latest stratum of the Bra1hman2a literature there are references to learned princes like Janaka of Videha, who is said to have become a Brahmin (brahma1), apparently in the sense that he had the full knowledge which a Brahmin possessed. 21) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 2, 1. Cf. Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 1. See Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Litcrature, 421 et seq.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 426 et seq. Similarly at the Di1ks2a1 a Ks2atriya becomes temporarily a Brahmin, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 23. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 3. Other learned Ks2atriyas of this period were Prava1han2a Jaivali, 22) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 1; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 8, 1; v. 3, 1; Muir, op. cit., 433-435; 515; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 117; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 1, lxxv. As4vapati Kaikeya, 23) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 1, 2 et seq. and Aja1tas4atru. 24) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 1; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 1. Garbe, 25) Beitra7ge zur indischen Kulturgeschichte, 1 et seq. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 17 et seq.; Winterniz, Geschichte der indischen Litteratur, 1, 199. Grierson, 26) Article ‘Bhakti’ in Encyclopœdia of Religion and Ethics; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 843. and others believe they are justified in holding the view that the Ksatriyas developed a special philosophy of their own as opposed to Brahminism, which appears later as Bhakti, or Faith. On the other hand, there is clear evidence 27) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 1, 4, 10. Cf. Oldenberg. Buddha, 73, n. 1; Keith, Aitareya A1ranyaka, 50, 257; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 868, 883, 1140-1142. Professor Eggeling concurs in the view that the Ks2atriya share in the religious movement was not substantially real. that the opinion of Ksatriyas on such topics were held in little respect, and it must be remembered that to attribute wisdom to a king was a delicate and effective piece of flattery. There are earlier references to royal sages (ra1janyars2i), 28) E.g., in Pan5cavims4a Bra1hman2a, xii. 12, 6; but see on this Oldenberg. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, 42, 235, n., and Varn2a. but it is very doubtful if much stress can be laid on them, and none can be laid on the later tradition of Sa1yan2a. 29) Cited in Muir, op. cit., 12, 265 et seq. Again, the Nirukta 30) ii. 10. gives a tradition relating how Deva1pi, a king's son, became the Purohita of his younger brother S4am2tanu; but it is very doubtful if the story can really be traced with Sieg 31) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 91 et seq. See Deva1pi. in the Rigveda 32) x. 98. The case of Vis4va1mitra may also be cited; but his royal rank, which is attested by the mention of him as a Ra1japutra in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17, is at most merely a matter of descent, and is of very doubtful authenticity. See under Varn2a. itself. In any case, the stories refer only to a few selected Ks2atriyas of high rank, while there is no evidence that the average Ks2atriya was concerned with intellectual pursuits. Nor is there any reference to Ks2atriyas engaging in agriculture or in trade or commerce. It may be assumed that the duties of administration and war were adequate to absorb his attention. On the other hand, we do hear of a Ra1janya as a lute player and singer at the As4vamedha or horse sacrifice. 33) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 3, 5. This mention is proof of the existence of a class of Ks2atriya bards (as opposed to priestly reciters), from whose productions the Epic naturally grew up. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 258. Of the training and education of a Ks2atriya we have no record; presumably, as in fact if not in theory later on, he was mainly instructed in the art of war, the science of the bow, and the rudimentary administrative functions which would devolve on him. At this early state of the development of the nobility which appears to be represented in the Rigveda, it was probably not unusual or impossible for a Vais4ya to become a Ks2atriya; at least, this assumption best explains the phrase 34) vii. 104, 13. Cf. for a similarly false claim to be a Brahmin, x. 71, 8. ‘claiming falsely a Ks2atriya's rank’ (ks2atriyam2 mithuya1 dha1rayantam). The king and the Ks2atriyas must have stood in a particularly close relation. The former being the Ks2atriya par excellence, it is to him rather than to the ordinary Ks2atriya that we must refer passages like that in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 35) vii. 1, 1, 8. where it is said that the Ks2atriya, with the consent of the clansmen, gives a settlement to a man: clearly a parallel to the rule found among many peoples that the chief, but only with the consent of the people, can make a grant of unoccupied land. In the same Bra1hman2a 36) xii. 8, 3, 19; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 254, n. 1. it is said that a Ks2atriya consecrates a Ks2atriya, a clear reference, as the commentator explains, to the practice of the old king consecrating the prince (kuma1ra) who is to succeed him; and again, 37) Cf. Eggeling, ibid., 41, 259. the Ks2atriya and the Purohita are regarded as alone complete in contrast with other people, the parallel with the Purohita here suggesting that the Ks2atriya par excellence is meant. On the other hand, the king is sometimes contrasted with the Ra1janya. 38) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 2, 17, and see Ra1janya. The Su1tra literature contains elaborate rules 39) See references in Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 395, 396. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 212 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 231 et seq.; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 151 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 4 et seq. (where practically every passage on the subject is cited or referred to); Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 98 et seq. (for the Epic parallels). for the educa tion and occupations of Ks2atriyas, but their contents cannot always be traced in the Bra1hman2a literature, and their value is questionable.

क्षपावन्
क्ष-पावन्,
 ‘protector of the earth,’ 1) The word occurs only in the nominative singular as ks2apa1va1n, which would be the regular form from a stem ks2apa1vant; but it is probably an irregularity for ks2apa1va1. Cf. Oldenberg. R2gveda-Noten, 1, 72. is an epithet of a king, 2) iii. 55, 17. or denotes a king 3) i. 70, 5; vii. 10, 5; viii. 71, 2; x. 29, 1. Cf. ks2iti-pa, ‘guardian of earth,’ ‘king,’ in later Sanskrit. in the Rigveda. The word is significant, as showing the function of the king as the protector of the tribal territory.

क्षिति
क्षिति
 is in the Rigveda 1) i. 65, 3; iii. 13, 4; v. 37. 4, etc. a regular word for ‘dwelling,’ and in particular the ks2itir dhruva1, ‘the secure dwelling,’ is mentioned 2) i. 73, 4 (cf. 2); vii. 88, 7. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 142. in a context that shows it, to be equivalent to the Vr2jana or Gra1ma regarded as a stronghold. From this sense is developed that of the peoples occupying the settlements, 3) Rv. iii. 38, 1; iv. 24, 4; 38, 5; v. 1, 10, etc. and in particular the five peoples 4) i. 7, 9; 176, 3; v. 35, 2; vi. 46, 7; vii. 75, 4; 79, 1. (for whom see Pan5ca Jana1sah2).

क्षिप्त
क्षिप्त,
 ‘a wound’ (caused by shooting), or ‘bruise’ (caused by throwing), is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 109, 1. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 389. together with a remedy for it, the Pippali1.

क्षिप्रश्येन
क्षिप्र-श्येन,
 ‘swift falcon,’ is the name of a bird in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (iii. 14, 11) and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a x. 5, 2, 10).

क्षीर
क्षीर,
 ‘milk,’ also called Go or Payas, played a large part in the economy of the Vedic Indians. 1) The word ks2i1ra does not occur in Rv. ii. vii. It is found in i. 109, 3; 164, 7; viii. 2, 9; ix. 67, 32; x. 87, 16 (= Av. viii. 3, 15). See Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 64, 73 et seq. See also Av. ii. 26, 4; v. 19, 5; x. 9, 12, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 8, 7, etc. It was taken warm (pakva as it came from the cow, 2)i. 62, 9; 180, 3; iii. 30, 4. or was used with grain to make a ‘mess cooked with milk’ (ks2i1ra-pa1kam odanam). 3)Rv. viii. 77, 10; Av. xiii. 2, 20. Cf. ks2i1ra-s4ri1, ‘milk-mixed,’ Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 0, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 57, etc. It was also used for mixing with Soma (Abhis4ri1, A1s4ir). From it butter (Ghr2ta) was made. Milk was also curdled, the Pu1ti1ka1 and Kvala plants, among others, being used for the purpose. 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 3, 5. The curdled milk (Dadhi) was undoubtedly used for food; and a kind of cheese is perhaps referred to in one passage of the Rigveda. 5) vi. 48, 18. Goat's milk (aja-ks2i1ra) is also mentioned. 6) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 2, 13; see Aja. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63, 226, 226, 268.

क्षीरौदन
क्षीरौदन,
 ‘rice cooked with milk,’ is mentioned frequently in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (ii. 5, 3, 4; xi. 5, 7, 5, etc.).

क्षुद्रसूक्तस्
क्षुद्र-सूक्तस्,
 ‘makers of short hymns,’ is the name given in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 1) ii. 2, 2. Cf. Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 212, and Macdonell, Br2haddevata1. notes on iii. 116. to the authors of certain hymns of the Rigveda. Cf. Maha1su1kta.

क्षुम्प
क्षुम्प
 is a word occurring only in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 84, 8. where it seems to mean a ‘bush.’ The Nirukta 2) v. 16. Cf. Benfey, Sa1maveda, Glossar, 53. identifies it with the Ahichatraka, a ‘mushroom.’

क्षुर
क्षुर
 occurs three times in the Rigveda. The word appears to have the general sense of ‘blade’ 1) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 61, 69. Cf. 13, 292 (as ‘knife’ in the Epic). in one passage, 2) i. 166, 10 (pavis2u ks2ura1h2 on the fellies of the Maruts' car; possibly ‘razors’ may be meant, as Max Mu7ller says in his note on this passage, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 235, n. 4). possibly also in another, 3) x. 28, 9, where Sa1yan2a renders it as meaning ‘having claws.’ The later tradition ascribes the swallowing to a goat. where it is said that the hare swallowed a Ks2ura, and where the sense ‘blade’ is adequate. In the third passage 4) viii. 4, 16 (sam2 nah2 s4is4i1hi bhurijor iva ks2uram, ‘sharpen us like a razor on a grindstone or stropping apparatus’). there seems to be a reference to the sharpening of a razor on a grindstone 5) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. (bhurijos, the dual denoting precisely, as Pischel 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 243. points out, the two sides of the apparatus, between which the stone revolved like the modern grindstone). But Muir, 7) Sanskrit Texts, 5, 466. following another view of Roth, 8) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. bhurij. adopts the sense ‘the edge of scissors,’ which, however, hardly suits the other passage, one in the Atharvaveda, 9) xx. 127, 4. where a Ks2ura is described as moving about on the bhurijos, 10) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 197, translates bhurijos by ‘on a strop.’ as the tongue on the lip. The meaning ‘razor’ is perfectly clear in the Atharvaveda, 11) vi. 68, 1. 3; viii. 2, 7. where shaving by means of it is mentioned; in many other passages 12) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 4, 5; iii. 1, 2, 7; ks2ura-pavi, Av. xii. 5, 20. 55; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 5, 7; 5, 5, 6; v. 6, 6, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 6, 2, 9. etc.; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 14; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvi. 8; Nirukta, v. 5. either sense is adequate. A ks2uro bhr2jva1n occurs in the Yajurveda: 13) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 12, 3. Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 8, 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 5, 2, 4. it seems to denote, as Bloomfield 14) American Journal of Philology, 17, 418. suggests, a razor with a strop (in the shape of a small grinding apparatus). Ks2ura-dha1ra1 15) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 13, 9. denotes ‘the edge of a razor,’ like ks2urasya dha1ra1. 16) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 3, 2. In the Upanis2ads 17) Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 266; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 239-243; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 38 et seq. a razor-case (Ks2ura-dha1na) is mentioned. See also S4mas4ru.

क्षेत्र
क्षेत्र,
 ‘field.’ The use of this word in the Rigveda points clearly to the existence of separate fields 1) x. 33, 6. Cf. iii. 31, 15; v. 62, 7. carefully measured off, 2) i. 110, 5. though in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating cultivated land generally. 3) i. 100, 18; ix. 85, 4; 91, 6; Ks2etrajes2a, i. 33, 15, ‘acquisition of land’; ks2etra1-sa1, iv. 38, 1, ‘gaining land’; ks2etram2-jaya, ‘conquering cultivated land,’ Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 11. The wider sense of ‘place’ also occurs, v. 2, 3; 45, 9; vi. 47, 20, etc., and often later. In the Atharvaveda 4) iv. 18, 5; v. 31, 4; x. 1, 18; xi. 1, 22; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 1, 2; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vii. 24, 2, etc. and later the sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more general use is also found. 5) Av. ii. 29, 3; xiv. 2, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 1, 15. 16, etc. The deity Ks2etrasya Pati, 6) Rv. iv. 37, 1, 2; vii. 35, 10; x. 66, 13; Av. ii. 8, 5; ks2etrasya patni1, ‘Mistress of the Field,’ 12, 1; ks2etra1n2a1m2 patih2, ‘Lord of Fields,’ Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 18. ‘Lord of the Field,’ should probably be understood as the god presiding over each field, just as Va1stos2 Pati presides over each dwelling. 7) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 138. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 1, 1, 8, where the Ks2atriya, with the consent of the people, gives a settlement to a man: that is, presumably assigns to him a definite Ks2etra for his own, probably measured out as recorded in Rv. i. 110, 5. It is a fair conclusion from the evidence that the system of separate holdings already existed in early Vedic times.^8 See also Urvara1, Khilya.

क्षेत्रिय
क्षेत्रिय
 is a disease which is mentioned several times in the Atharvaveda, and against which three hymns are specially directed. 1) ii. 8. 10; iii. 7. Cf. ii. 14, 5; iv. 18, 7. It is also mentioned in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 2) xv. 1. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 3) ii. 5, 6, 1-3, where the form is Ks2etri1, explained as a demon causing illness, merely an incorrect version of Av. iii. 10. The commentators on the Atharvaveda agree in taking it to be a hereditary disease. The word may mean ‘organic,’ 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or possibly ‘produced in the field,’ as a theory of its origin. What disease is really intended is quite uncertain. Weber 5) Indische Studien, 5, 145; 13, 150 et seq.: 17, 208; Naxatra, 2, 292. considered that the aim of the Atharvan hymns was to drive away injury threatening the fields, but this is improbable. Bloomfield 6) Atharvaveda, 60. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 286 et seq.; Whitney, Transiation of the Atharvaveda, 48, 49; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 391, 392; Speijer, De ceremonia apud Indos quœ ja1takarma vocatur, 76-83; Pa1n2ini, v. 2, 92, with the Ka1s4ika1 Vr2tti. suggests ‘scrofula’ or ‘syphilis.’ The remedies mentioned throw no light on the symptoms. 

क्षेमधृत्वन्पौण्डरीक
क्षेम-धृत्वन् पौण्डरीक
 (‘descendant of Pun2d2ari1ka’) is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xxii. 18, 7. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 32. Later, the name is Ks2ema-dhanvan, Harivam2s4a, 824, etc. as having sacrificed on the bank of the river Suda1man.

क्षैमि
क्षैमि,
 ‘descendant of Ks2ema,’ is the patronymic of Sudaks2in2a in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 6, 3; 7, 1, etc.; 8, 6).

क्षोणी
क्षोणी
 --This word, when used in the plural, denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary and Ludwig, 1)Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 247. in several passages of the Rigveda, 2) i. 57, 4; 173, 7; viii. 3, 10; 13, 17; x. 95. 19. In ii. 34, 13; x. 22, 9, the sense is doubtful. the free retainers of the king. Geldner 3) Bezzenberger, Beitra7ge, 11, 327. at one time thought it referred to the wives of the king, pointing to polygamy; but later 4) Vedische Studien, 1, 279, 283. he concluded that it means certain divine wives.

क्षौम
क्षौम,
 ‘a linen garment,’ is mentioned in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (iii. 6, 7, etc.) and in the Su1tras.

क्ष्विङ्का
क्ष्विङ्का
 is mentioned once in the Rigveda 1) x. 87, 7. as a bird of prey. The word also occurs in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 2) v. 5, 15, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. where the commentary absurdly explains it as ‘a red-mouthed female ape’ (rakta-mukhi1 va1nari1). KH.

ख
ख
 denotes in the Rigveda 1) Rv. viii. 77, 3; 91, 7; x. 156, 3, where only the Kha is referred to. Cf. the adjective su-kha, ‘having a good axle-hole,’ ‘running easily’; later, ‘agreeable.’ and later 2) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, v. 12, 1 (Ma1dhyam2dina; v. 10, 1 Ka1n2va). the hole in the nave of the wheel in which the axle is inserted. There was a difference, it seems, in the size of the hole in the wheel of a cart (Anas) and of a chariot (Ratha). 3) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, 1, 3, 6; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 333. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 247. See also 1. Yuga.

 See Khad2ga.

खड्ग
खड्ग
 is the reading in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 1) iii. 14, 21. of the name of an animal which, in the text of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 2) xxiv. 40. variously appears as Khan3ga and Khad2ga. The rhinoceros seems clearly to be meant. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. In the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 4) xiv. 33, 26 (kha1d2ga-kavaca as4varatha) a rhinoceros hide is mentioned as the covering of a chariot.

खण्डिकऔद्भारि
खण्डिक औद्भारि
 (‘descendant of Udbha1ra’) is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xi. 8, 4, 1. as a teacher of Kes4in, and in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 2) i. 4, 12, where S2an2d2ika is the reading of the MSS. as having been defeated by Kes4in as a sacrificer. A Kha1n2d2ika appears in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 3) Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 20. as an enemy of Kes4in.

खदिर
खदिर
 is mentioned frequently from the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 19. onwards 2) Av. iii. 6, 1; v. 5, 5; viii. 8, 3; x. 6, 6; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 9, 3, etc. So kha1dira, ‘made of Khadira wood,’ Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 7, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 3, 20; iii. 6, 2, 12 etc. as a tree with hard wood 3) Av. x. 6, 6. --the Acacia catechu. The As4vattha is referred to as engrafting itself upon it in the Atharvaveda, 4) iii. 6, 1. Cf. viii. 8, 3. and from it the climbing plant Arundhati1 is said to have sprung. 5) Av. v. 5. 5. The sruva or sacrificial ladle is spoken of as having been made from it, 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 7, 1. no doubt because of its hardness. It is in the same passage also said to have sprung from the sap (rasa) of the Ga1yatri1. There is no clear reference to Catechu having been prepared from its core, 7) It is called bahu-sa1ra, ‘of great strength,’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 4, 9. as it was later. The core (sa1ra) was used for making amulets. 8) S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 58, 58.

खद्योत
ख-द्योत
 (‘sky-illuminator’), ‘the firefly,’ is mentioned in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (vi. 7, 3. 5).

खनित्र
खनित्र,
 a ‘shovel’ or ‘spade’ for digging, is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 179, 6 (possibly metaphorical: see Oldenberg. R2gveda-Noten, 1, 172; the passage is obscure). and later. 2) La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 2, 4, etc.

खनित्रिम
खनित्रिम,
 ‘produced by digging,’ as an epithet of a1pah2, ‘waters,’ clearly refers to artificial water channels used for irrigation, as practised in the times of the Rigveda 1) vii. 49, 2. and the Atharvaveda. 2) i. 6, 4; xix. 2, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 466.

खर
खर,
 ‘ass,’ is mentioned in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 1) iii. 2, 4. where a team of asses is alluded to. Probably the passages in the Satapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) v. 1, 2, 15; xiv. 1, 2, 17; 2, 2, 30. where the word is used to denote an earth mound on which the sacrificial vessels were placed, presuppose the sense of ‘ass,’ the mound being shaped in this form. 3) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

खर्गला
खर्गला
 is an ‘owl’ or other nocturnal bird mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) vii. 104, 17. Cf. Kaus4ika Su1tra, 107; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93.

खर्जूर
खर्जूर
 is the name of a tree (Phœnix silvestris) which is mentioned in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 9, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 10; xxxvi. 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63.

खल
खल,
 the ‘threshing-floor,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 48, 7; Nirukta, iii. 10. and the Atharvaveda. 2) xi. 3, 9; khala-ja, ‘produced on a threshing-floor,’ viii. 6, 15; khalya, ‘being on a threshing-floor,’ Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. See Kr2s2i.

खलकुल
खल-कुल
 is a word occurring in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 1) vi. 3. 22 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 3, 13 Ka1n2va). Cf. Weber, Indische Studien 1, 355. where Sa1yan2a glosses it by Kulattha, a kind of pulse (Dolichos uniflorus).

खल्व
खल्व
 is some sort of grain or leguminous plant, perhaps, as Weber 1) Indische Studien, 1, 355. thinks, the Phaselus radiatus. It is mentioned with other grains of all sorts in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 2) xviii. 12, where Mahi1dhara glosses it by can2aka, ‘chick-pea.’ and as being crushed with the Dr2s2ad in the Atharvaveda. 3) ii. 31. 1; v. 23, 8. It occurs also in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 4) vi. 3. 22 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 3, 13 Ka1n2va). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 241. where S4an3kara glosses it with nis2pa1va.

खाण्डव
खाण्डव
 is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 1) v. 1, 1. as one of the boundaries of Kuruks2etra. There seems no reason to doubt its identity with the famous Kha1n2d2ava forest of the Maha1bha1rata. The name occurs also in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xxv. 3, 6. and the S4a1t2ya1yanaka. 3) Max Mu7ller, R2gveda, ^2 iv. ci. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78. 

खादि
खादि
 occurs frequently in the Rigveda denoting either anklets 1) v. 54, 11, and perhaps 53, 4. or armlets, 2) This is what Kha1dis on the shoulders must mean, i. 166, 9; vii. 56, 13. or sometimes rings on the hands. 3) i. 168, 3; kha1di-hasta, ‘with rings on the hands,’ 5, 58, 2. So Roth takes Kha1din in vi. 16, 40; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Kha1din occurs also in ii. 34, 2; x. 38, 1. Max Mu7ller 4) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 120, 230. considers that the word means quoits, the later Cakra. 5) Cf. vr2s2a-kha1di, Rv. i. 64, 10. The rings were sometimes of gold. 6) Hiran2ya-kha1di, S4a1n3kha1yana S4ranta Su1tra, iii. 5, 12; viii. 23, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 149.

खारी
खारी
 designates a measure of Soma in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) iv. 32, 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 280.

खार्गलि
खार्गलि,
 ‘descendant of Khargala1 or Khr2gala,’ is the metronymic or patronymic of Lus4a1kapi. 1) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxx. 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 4, 3.

खिल
1. Khila, 1) Av. vii. 115, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 3, 4, 1. Khilya 2) Rv. vi. 28, 2; x. 142, 3. appear to have the same meaning. According to Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. So Whitney on Av., loc. cit. these terms denote the waste land lying between cultivated fields; but he admits that this sense does not suit the passage of the Rigveda 4) vi. 28, 2. in which it is said that the god places the worshipper on an unbroken Khilya (abhinne khilye), and he accordingly conjectures the reading akhilyabhinne, ‘land unbroken by barren strips.’ Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 205. thinks that the meaning intended is broad lands, which were used for the pasturing of the cattle of the community, and were not broken up by cultivated fields. Oldenberg, 6) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 385, 386. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 499; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiutic Society, 1910, 228. however, points out that the sense is rather the land which lay between cultivated fields, but which need not be deemed to have been unfertile, as Roth thought. This agrees with the fact that in Vedic times separate fields were already known: see Ks2etra. 

खिल
2. Khila as a designation of certain hymns appended to the received text of the Rigveda occurs only in the Su1tra period. 1) See Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 16 et seq. The term is a metaphorical application of the preceding word, ‘a space not filled up,’ ‘a supplement.’

खृगल
खृगल,
 or, as the Paippala1da recension of the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 9. 3. has it, Khugila, is an obscure expression found in two passages only--once in the Rigveda, 2) ii. 39, 4. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 340; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 98. and once in the Atharvaveda. 1) iii. 9. 3. In the former the meaning ‘crutch’ seems required; in the latter Sa1yan2a glosses it by ‘armour’ (tanu-tra1n2a), but the sense is quite uncertain.

खेल
खेल
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 15. where Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 171-173. considers that a god, Vivasvant, is meant, and that races were run in his honour, explaining thus the phrase a1ja1 khelasya, as ‘in the race of Khela.’ Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks that a man is meant, and Sieg, 4) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 127, 128. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 4. 28. following Sa1yan2a, sees in him a king whose Purohita was Agastya. See also Am2s4u. G.

गङ्गा
गङ्गा,
 the modern Ganges, is mentioned directly in the Rigveda only once, in the Nadi1-stuti or ‘Praise of Rivers.’ 1) x. 75, 5. But it is also referred to in the derivative form ga1n3gyah2 as an epithet of Urukaks2a. 3) The reference to the Gan3ga1 remains, even if with Oldenberg (R2gvedaNoten, 1, 396) we assume that a thicket i meant, and not a proper name (cf. Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 2, 288). See also Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 563, n. 1. The name of this river does not occur 2) vi. 45, 31. in the other Sam2hita1, but appears in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 4) xiii. 5, 4, 11. The victory on the Gan3ga1 represents the farthest extent of Bharata or Kuru rule. Cf. Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 23, and a verse in the Vaita1na Su1tra, xxxiv. 9, where the Sarasvati1 is also referred to. where victories of Bharata Dauh2s2anti on both Gan3ga1 and Yamuna1 are referred to, and in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 5) ii. 20. especial honour is assigned to those who dwell between the Gan3ga1 and the Yamuna1, this being. To doubt, the region in which that text originated. The identification of the Gan3ga1 with the Apaya1 6) Rv. iii. 23, 4. made by Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 4. 5. must be rejected: see A1paya1.

गज
गज,
 the common name of the elephant in Epic 1) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 265, 269. and later Sanskrit, is only found in the late Adbhuta Bra1hman2a. 2) Indische Studien, 1, 39. See Hastin.

गणक
गणक,
 ‘an astrologer,’ occurs in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 20; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 15, 1. Cf. Weber. Indische Streifen, 1, 78. See also Naks2atradars4a.

गन्धर्वायणबालेय
गन्धर्वायण बालेय
 (‘descendant of Bali’) A1gnives4ya is mentioned as a Pan5ca1la in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xx. 25).

गन्धार
गन्धार
 is a later form of the name of the people called Gandha1ri in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 1) vi. 14, 1. 2. See Oldenberg, Buddha, 399, n.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 219, n. On the other hand, Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 15. 106, thought the passage meant that the Gandha1ras were near the writer. the Gandha1ras are referred to as being distant from the writer. See also Ga1ndha1ra. 

गन्धारि
गन्धारि
 is the name of a people in the north-west of India. In the Rigveda 1) i. 126, 7. the good wool of the sheep of the Gandha1ris is referred to. The Gandha1ris are also mentioned with the Mu1javants, Angas, and Magadhas in the Atharvaveda. 2) v. 22, 14. The latter two tribes are apparently the Eastern limit of the poet's knowledge, the two former the Northern. Gandha1ris 3) Hiran2yakes4i S4rauta Su1tra, xvii. 6; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 6, 18. or Ga1ndha1ris 4) Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxi. 13. are also spoken of in the S4rauta Su1tras. 5) See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 56, 553. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 30, 31. considers that they were settled in Vedic times on the south bank of the Kubha1 up to its mouth in the Indus, and for some distance down the east side of the Indus itself. They later formed a portion of the Persian empire, and detachments of Gandarians accompanied Xerxes in his expedition against Greece. 7) Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 23. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 206.

गभस्ति
गभस्ति
 denotes, according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the pole of a chariot in the epithet syu1ma-gabhasti, ‘having reins as a pole,’ used of the car of the gods in the Rigveda, 2) i. 122, 5; vii. 71, 3. and independently in the plural in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 3) ii. 7, 13, 4. The meaning is, however, doubtful. 4) See Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 55. Roth 5) Op. cit., s.v. himself suggests that syu1ma-gabhasti may refer to a sort of double reins.

गय
1. Gaya, ‘house,’ is a common word in the Rigveda, 1) i. 74, 2; v. 10, 3; 44, 7; vi. 2, 8, etc. and sometimes occurs later. 2) Av. vi. 3, 3; 84, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxvii. 3. As its sense includes the inmates as well as their belongings, it is equivalent to ‘household.’

गयप्लात
2. Gaya Pla1ta (‘son of Plati’) is referred to in the Rigveda, 1) x. 63, 17; 64, 17 (as son of Plati). two hymns of which he clearly claims to have composed, and which are attributed to him in the Sarva1nukraman2i1 and the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 2) v. 2. In the Atharvaveda 3) i. 14, 4. Cf. also the Khila after Rv. v. 51, 15; Indische Studien, 3, 214. he appears with Asita and Kas4yapa as a half-mythical magician. 4) Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 403. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133; Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 460.

गर
1. Gara, ‘poison,’ is referred to in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 18, 13. Cf. gara alone, Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xix. 4, 2 (see Indische Studien, 1, 33); Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 9, 10; gara-gir, ‘poisoned,’ Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 1, 9; xix. 4, 2. 10. in the compound gara-gi1rn2a, ‘poisoned.’ In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xi. 5, 8, 6. it means simply a ‘fluid.’

गर
2. Gara is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) ix. 2, 16. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 52. as the author of a Sa1man or Chant, and as a friend of Indra.

गर्ग
गर्ग
 is the name of a sage who is not mentioned in any of the Sam2hita1s, 1) The authorship of Rv. vi. 47 is attributed to Garga Bha1radva1ja in the Anukraman2i1. but his descendants, the Garga1h2 Pra1vareya1h2, are referred to in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 2) xiii. 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 374. Garga himself does not occur till the Su1tra period. 3) Garga-trira1tra, Garga-tryaha, a three-night or three-day feast of Garga. See A1s4vala1yana Srauta Su1tra, x. 2; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 22. 2; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxiii. 2, 8.

गर्गर
गर्गर,
 apparently the designation of a musical instrument, is mentioned once in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 69, 9. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 144, n. 1; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289.

गर्त
गर्त
 in the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 9. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 246, 247. Zimmer wrongly takes this passage to refer to standing in the car. See Hopkins. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 238, 239; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 48, and cf. garta-sad, ‘sitting on the car seat,’ in Rv. ii. 33. 11. primarily denotes the seat of the chariot on which the archer sat. It seems to have been of considerable size, being described as br2hant, 2) v. 62, 8; 68, 5. ‘large.’ The word then comes to denote the chariot 3) So probably in v. 62, 5; garta1-ruh, ‘mounting the chariot,’ in Rv. i. 124, 7; Nirukta, iii. 5, may refer merely to mounting the seat. The passage is obscure; see Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 22. itself, either really or metaphorically. 4) vii. 64, 4 (of the hymn).

गर्दभ
गर्दभ,
 ‘the ass,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 23. A car drawn by asses is referred to in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 9; see also Khara. as inferior to the horse. In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 he again appears as inferior to the horse, 2) v. 1, 2, 1. 2. but at the same time as the best bearer of burdens (bha1ra-bha1ritama) among animals. 3) v. 1, 5, 5. The same authority styles the ass dvi-retas, ‘having double seed,’ 4) v. 1, 5, 5; vii. 1, 1, 2; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 57, 4 (Oertel, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 177-180): of the Ra1sabha, S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 3, 1, 23. in allusion to his breeding with the mare as well as the she-ass. The smallness of the young of the ass, and his capacity for eating, are both referred to. 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 5, 5. The disagreeable cry of the animal is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 6) viii. 6, 10. and in allusion to this the term ‘ass’ is applied opprobriously to a singer in the Rigveda. 7) i. 29, 5. A hundred asses are spoken of as a gift to a singer in a Va1lakhilya hymn. 8) viii. 56, 3. The mule (as4vatara) is the offspring of an ass and a mare, the latter, like the ass, being called dviretas, 9) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 1, 2. 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 6; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 57, 4. ‘receiving double seed,’ for similar reasons. The male ass is often also termed Ra1sabha. The female ass, Gardabhi1, is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 10) x. 1, 4. and the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 11) i. 4, 8. For other references to the ass as Gardabha, see Av. v. 31, 3; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 34; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 1, 9; xii. 7, 1, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 232, 233.

गर्दभीमुख
गर्दभी-मुख
 is mentioned as a teacher in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 384. 

गर्दभीविपीत
गर्दभी-विपीत,
 or Gardabhi1-vibhi1ta, is the name of a teacher who was a Bha1radva1ja and a contemporary of Janaka, mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) iv. 1, 11 (Ma1dhyam2dina = iv. 1, 5 Ka1n2va).

 is the name of a kind of wild bean mentioned in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 1) ii. 4, 4, 1. 2. The Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 2) x. 11. has the form Ganmut, which is probably a false reading. The adjective ga1rmuta, ‘made from the Garmut bean,’ is found in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1. 3) ii. 2, 4. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71.

गव्यूति

 in the Rigveda 1) i. 25, 16; iii. 62, 16; v. 66, 3; vii. 77, 4, etc. means, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. grass land for the pasturing of cattle, in which sense Gavya is also found. 3) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 28; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3b. Thence it derives the sense of a measure of distance found in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 4) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 13, 12. Geldner, on the other hand, takes the original meaning to be ‘road,’ real 6) Rv. i. 25, 16. or metaphorical, 7) Rv. vi. 47, 20; x. 14, 2. thence a measure of distance, 8) Rv. viii. 60, 20, and n. 4. and finally ‘land.’ 9) Rv. iii. 62, 16; vii. 62, 5; 65, 4; viii. 5, 6. 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 290, 291.

 in the Rigveda 1) viii. 32, 1; 71, 14; 98, 9; ix. 99, 4; ga1tha, i. 167, 6; ix. 11, 4; ga1tha-pati, ‘lord of song,’ i. 43, 4; ga1tha1-ni1, ‘leading a song,’ i. 190, 1; viii. 92, 2; r2juga1tha, ‘singing correctly,’ v. 44, 5; ga1thin, ‘singer,’ i. 7, 1. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 65. usually means only ‘song,’ ‘verse,’ like Ga1tu. 2) i. 151, 2; ii. 20, 5; iii. 4, 4; iv. 4, 6; v. 87, 8; x. 20, 4; 122, 2. In one passage, 3) x. 85, 6. however, it already has a more special sense, as it is classed with Na1ra1s4am2si1 and Raibhi1, a collocation repeatedly found later. 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 11, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, As4vamedha, v. 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 32; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 6, 8, where Raibhi1 does not occur; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 12. The commentators identify the three terms with certain verses of the Atharvaveda, 5) Viz., Ga1tha1 = Av. xx. 127, 12 et seq.; Na1ra1s4am2si1 = Av. xx. 127, 1-3; Raibhi1 = Av. xx. 127, 4-6; while ibid., 7-10, are known as Pa1riks2ityah2 (scil., r2cah2). but Oldenberg 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 238. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 689 et seq., seems to accept the identification even for the Rigveda. has shown that this identification is incorrect for the Rigveda. Ga1tha1s are often mentioned elsewhere, 7) Av. x. 10, 20; xv. 6, 4 (distinct from Na1ra1s4am2si1); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 4, 16; xi. 5, 7, 10; xiii. 1, 5, 6; 4, 2, 8; 5, 4, 2; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 10 (distinct from Na1ra1s4am2si1); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 17, 9, etc. and are referred to as metrical in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 8) ii. 3, 6, with Keith's note; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 7, 10. where the R2c, Kumbya1, and Ga1tha1 are classed as forms of verse. The Aitareya Bra1hman2a 9) vii. 18. The story of S4unah2s4epa is described as s4ata-ga1tham, ‘told in a hundred Ga1tha1s.’ distinguishes between R2c and Ga1tha1 as divine and human respectively. According to the usage of the Bra1hman2as and the liturgical literature, as stated by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the Ga1tha1s are, though religious in content, distinguished from R2c, Yajus, and Sa1man as nonVedic--that is, are not Mantras. This view is consistent with the fact that the phrase Yajn5a-ga1tha1, meaning a verse summarizing a sacrificial usage, is not rare. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 10) xiii. 5, 4, etc., and see xiii. 4, 2, 8, where the Ga1tha1s are plainly Da1nastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ just as the Na1ra1s4am2si1 verses are declared to be in the Br2haddevata1, iii. 154. preserves several Ga1tha1s, which generally accord with this description as epitomizing the sacrifices of famous kings, and the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 11) iii. 7, 3. states that a Ga1tha1 is sung at a wedding. Sometimes 12) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 2, 6. So Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 98, takes S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 6, 8, where Sa1yan2a hesitates between identifying the two and distinguishing them. It seems reasonable to regard Ga1tha1 as the wider term which covers, but is not coextensive with, Na1ra1s4am2si1. Cf. Sa1yan2a's example of a Ga1tha1 in his commentary on Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 3, 6: pra1tah2 pra1tar anr2tam2 te vadanti, ‘they every morning tell an untruth,’ which is clearly not a Na1ra1s4am2si1. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 689 et seq.; Weber, Episches im Vedischen Ritual, 4 et seq.; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 493. Ga1tha1 is qualified as Na1ra1s4am2si1, where it must be a eulogy of a generous donor.

गाथिन्
गाथिन्
 is mentioned as the son of Kus4ika and father of Vis4va1mitra in the Sarva1nukraman2i1. It is difficult to say whether this tradition is correct; it derives some support from the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (vii. 18), where reference is made to the divine lore (daiva veda) of the Ga1thins, which is said to be shared by S4unah2s4epa as a result of his adoption by Vis4va1mitra. See Ga1thina.

गाथिन
गाथिन
 --The sons of Vis4va1mitra are described in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 18. Cf. A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vii. 18; Weber, Episches im Vedischen Ritual, 16, n. 3. as Ga1thinas, or descendants of Ga1thin, who, according to tradition, was their grandfather; 2) Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 348 et seq.; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 32 et seq. and Vis4va1mitra himself is styled Ga1thina in the Sarva1nukraman2i1. 

गांदम
गां-दम
 is the form in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xxi. 14, 20. of the name of Ekaya1van, which in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 2) ii. 7, 11, 2. Cf. Hopkins, Transac tions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 69. is read as Ka1m2dama.

गान्धार
गान्धार,
 ‘a king of Gandha1ra’ named Nagnajit, is mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) vii. 34. in the list of teachers who handed down the knowledge of the substitute for Soma. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) viii. 1, 4, 10. he or some descendant figures as Svarjit Na1gnajita or Nagnajit, and as giving an opinion on the ritual, which is rejected with the observation that the author was merely a princely person (ra1janya-bandhu).

गार्गीवाचक्नवी
गार्गी वाचक्नवी
 is referred to in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) iii. 6, 1; 8, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 118. as a female contemporary and rival of Ya1jn5avalkya.

गार्गीपुत्र
गार्गी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of Gargi1,’ occurs as the name of three teachers in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Ma1dhyam2dina recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 4, 30). The earliest of these three was the pupil of Ba1d2eyi1putra and the teacher of the second Ga1rgi1putra. The latter was the teacher of Pa1ra1s4ari1kaun2d2ini1putra, the teacher of the third Ga1rgi1putra.

गार्ग्य
गार्ग्य,
 ‘descendant of Garga,’ is the patronymic of Ba1la1ki in the Br2hada1ran2yaka 1) ii. 1, 1. and the Kaus2i1taki 2) iv. 1. Upanis2ads. Two Ga1rgyas are mentioned in the second Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad: 3) iv. 6, 2 (Ka1n2va) one of them is the pupil of Ga1rgya, who again is the pupil of Gautama. Others occur in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 4) i. 7, 3. and in the Nirukta, 5) i. 3. 12; iii. 13. as well as later in the ritual Su1tras. Thus the family was evidently long connected with the development of liturgy and grammar. 

गार्ग्यायण
गार्ग्यायण,
 ‘descendant of Ga1rgya,’ is mentioned as a pupil of Udda1laka1yana in the second Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (iv. 6, 2 Ka1n2va).

गार्ग्यायणि
गार्ग्यायणि,
 ‘descendant of Ga1rgya,’ is a variant reading for Ga1n3gya1yani as the patronymic of Citra in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad (i. 1).

गालव
गालव
 is mentioned as a pupil of Vidarbhi1kaun2d2inya in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Ma1dhyam2dina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Ka1n2va). It is possibly the same man that is referred to regarding a point of ritual in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka. 2) v. 3, 3. A grammarian of this name is mentioned in the Nirukta. 3) iv. 3. Cf. Pa1n2ini, vi. 3, 61; vii. 1, 74; 3, 99; viii. 4, 67.

गिरि
गिरि,
 ‘mountain’ or ‘height,’ is a word that occurs repeatedly in the Rigveda. 1) i. 56, 3; 61, 14; 63, 1; iv. 20, 6; vi. 24, 8, etc. Thus reference is made to the trees on the hills, hence called ‘tree-haired’ (vr2ks2a-kes4a1h2), 2) Rv. v. 41, 11. and to the streams proceeding from the hills to the sea (samudra). 3) Rv. vii. 95, 2. The term is frequently coupled with the adjectival parvata. 4) Rv. i. 56, 4; viii. 64, 5; Av. iv. 7, 8; vi. 12, 3; 17, 3; ix. 1, 18, etc. The Rigveda mentions the waters from the hills, 5) Rv. vi. 66, 11, on which passage, see Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 411; viii. 32, 4; x. 68, 1, etc. and the Atharvaveda 6) xii. 1, 11. See Himavant. refers to the snowy mountains. Actual names of mountains, as Mu1javant, Trikakud, Himavant, are very rare. References to Kraun5ca, Maha1meru, and Maina1ga, are confined to the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, while Na1vaprabhram2s4ana can no longer be considered a proper name. 7) Av. xix. 37, 8, with Whitney's note in his Translation; Macdonell, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1107. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 47.

गिरिक्षितौच्चामन्यव
गिरि-क्षित् औच्चा-मन्यव,
 ‘descendant of Ucca1manyu,’ is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (x. 5, 7) as a contemporary of Abhiprata1rin Ka1ks2asen2i 

गिरिजबाभ्रव्य
गिरि-ज बाभ्रव्य,
 ‘descendant of Babhru,’ is mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (vii. 1) as having been taught by S4rauta the method of dividing the sacrificial animal (pas4or vibhakti).

गुग्गुलु
गुग्गुलु,
 ‘bdellium,’ is referred to in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) xix. 38, 2. as produced by the Sindhu 2) Or ‘from streams’ (saindhava), as Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. guggulu, suggests. and by the sea. The latter source presumably alludes, as Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 28. assumes, to seaborne trade, bdellium being the gum of a tree, not a product of the sea. It is, however, possible that in this passage some other substance may be meant. The word in this form also occurs elsewhere in the Atharvaveda 4) ii. 36, 7. and later; 5) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 28. it is often 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 8, 6; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 8, 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 13; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 2, 16. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 675; Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 12, 339; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 957, 958. mentioned in the older form of Gulgulu, between which and Guggulu the manuscripts constantly vary

गुङ्गु
गुङ्गु
 --The descendants of Gun3gu are referred to as Gun3gus in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 48, 8. Cf. Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. apparently as friends of Atithigva. Possibly a people may be meant.

गुप्त
गुप्त
 is the name in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 42) of Vaipas4cita Da1rd2hajayanti Gupta Lauhitya. All the three other names being patronymics show that he was descended from the families of Vipas4cit, Dr2d2hajayanta, and Lohita.

गृत्समद
गृत्स-मद
 is the name of a seer to whom the Sarva1nukraman2i1 attributes the authorship of the second Man2d2ala of the Rigveda. This tradition is supported by the Aitareya Bra1h man2a 1) v. 2, 4. and the Aitareya Aran2yaka. 2) ii. 2, 1. The Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 3) xxii. 4. Cf. Ga1rtsamadi1, xxviii. 2. speaks of him as a Bha1rgava, ‘descendant of Bhr2gu,’ with a variant Ba1bhrava, ‘descendant of Babhru,’ but the later tradition keeps to the former patronymic. 4) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 226 et seq. The Gr2tsamadas are often mentioned in the second Man2d2ala of the Rigveda, 5) ii. 4, 9; 19, 8; 39, 8; 41, 18. and are also called S4unahotras, 6) ii. 18, 6; 41, 14. 17. but never Ga1rtsamadas or S4aunahotras, and Gr2tsamada himself never occurs there. 7) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 200, 201.

More generally the word is used to designate any bird of prey, the eagle (S4yena) being classed as the chief of the Gr2dhras. 5) Rv. ix. 96, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 88; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 225.

गृष्टि
गृष्टि,
 ‘a young cow,’ which has only calved once, occurs in the Rigveda 1) iv. 18, 10. and the Atharvaveda, 2) ii. 13, 3; viii. 9, 24; xix. 24, 5. as well as in the later Su1tra literature. 3) Kaus4ika Su1tra, 19. 24, etc.

गृह
गृह
 is used in the singular, 1) Rv. iii. 53, 6; iv. 49, 6; viii. 10. 1, etc.; Av. vii. 83, 1; x. 6, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 21. or oftener in the plural, 2) Rv. ii. 42, 3; v. 76, 4; x. 18, 12; 85, 26; 142, 4; 165, 2; Av. i. 27, 4; iii. 10, 11; vi. 137, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 31; viii. 26; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 32; iv. 33; xviii. 44; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 22; 6, 1, 19, etc. to denote the ‘house’ of the Vedic Indian. Dama or Dam has the same sense, while Pastya1 and Harmya denote more especially the home with its surroundings, the family settlement. The house held not only the family, which might be of considerable size, but also the cattle 3) Rv. vii. 56, 16; Av. i. 3, 4; ix. 3, 13. and the sheep 4) Rv. x. 106, 5; Av. iii. 3. at night. It was composed of several rooms, as the use of the plural indicates, and it could be securely shut up. 5) Rv. vii. 85, 6. The door (Dva1r, Dva1ra) is often referred to, and from it the house is called Duron2a. In every house the fire was kept burning. 6) Rv. i. 69, 2. Cf. the Ga1rhapatya Agni, Av. v. 31, 5; vi. 120, 1; 121, 2; viii. 102; ix. 6, 30; xii. 2, 34; xviii. 4, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. iii. 39; xix. 18; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 6. 12; Kaus2i1t taki Bra1hman2a, ii. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 6, 1, 28; vii. 1, 1, 6, etc. Very little is known of the structure of the house. Presumably stone was not used, 7) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153. Muir's view, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 461, that clay was used can only apply to the minor finishing of the walls of a house. and houses were, as in Megasthenes' time, 8) Arrian, Indica, x. 2. built of wood. The hymns of the Atharvaveda 9) iii. 12; ix. 3. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 343 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 234 et seq.; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 525 et seq. give some information about the construction of a house, but the details are extremely obscure, for most of the expressions used do not recur in any context in which their sense is clear. According to Zimmer, 10) Op. cit., 153. No certainty can attach to the rendering of the words. four pillars (Upamit) were set up on a good site, and against them beams were leant at an angle as props (Pratimit). The upright pillars were connected by cross beams (Parimit) resting upon them. The roof was formed of ribs of bamboo cane (vam2s4a), 11) It seems likely that, as the ribs were of bamboo and were probably fixed in the ridge, the roof was wagon headed, like the huts of the Todas at the present day (see illustrations in Rivers, The Todas, pp. 25, 27, 28, 51), and the rock-cut Chaityas, or Assembly Halls, of the Buddhists in Western India, in some of the earliest of which the wooden ribs of the arched roof are still preserved. See Fergusson, History of Indian Architecture, 22, 135, cf. 126. a ridge called Vis2u1vant, and a net (Aks2u), which may mean a thatched covering 12) Av. ix. 3, 8, where Bloomfield, op. cit., 598, thinks of a wickerwork roof; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 136, of a pole with countless holes. over the bamboo ribs. The walls were filled up with grass in bundles (palada), and the whole structure was held together with ties of various sorts (nahana, pra1n2a1ha, sam2dam2s4a, paris2van5jalya). 13) Av. ix. 3, 4. 5. In connexion with the house, mention is made of four terms which, though primarily sacrificial in meaning, seem to designate parts of the building: Havirdha1na, ‘oblation-holder’; Agnis4a1la, 14) Zimmer conjecturally identifies the Agnis4a1la with the central room, the Havirdha1na with a place for keeping the grain, etc. (e.g., Av. iii. 3, 4), the Patni1na1m2 Sadana with the women's apartments, and the Sadas with the subsidiary buildings. ‘fireplace’; Patni1na1m2 Sadana, ‘wives’ room’; and Sadas, ‘sitting room.’ Slings or hanging vessels (S4ikya) are also mentioned. 15) Av. ix. 3, 6. See Whitney, op. cit., 526; Bloomfield, op. cit., 597. Reedwork (it2a) is spoken of, no doubt as part of the finishing of the walls of the house. 16) Av. ix. 3, 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 148-156. The sides are called Paks2a. The door with its framework was named A1ta1.

गैरिक्षित
गैरि-क्षित,
 ‘descendant of Giriks2it,’ is the patronymic of Trasadasyu in the Rigveda, 1) v. 33, 8; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155, 174. and of the Yaskas in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 2) xiii. 12; Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 474, 475.

गो
1. Go (a), ‘ox’ or ‘cow.’ 1) i. 83, 1; 135, 8; ii. 23, 18, etc.; ga1va uks2an2ah2, i. 168, 2; Av. iii. 11, 8; Va1jasan2eyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 20; ga1vo dhenavah2, Rv. i. 173. 1; vi. 45. 28; x. 95, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 19. etc. These were among the chief sources of wealth to the Vedic Indian, and are repeatedly referred to from the Rigveda onwards. 2) The five sacrificial animals are man, goat, sheep, ox, horse, Sa1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 23, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 3, 13; iii. 1, 2, 13; iv. 5, 5, 10; xiv. 1, 1, 32. The milk (Ks2i1ra) was either drunk fresh or made into butter (Ghr2ta) or curds (Dadhi), or was mixed with Soma or used for cooking with grain (Ks2i1raudana). The cows were milked thrice a day, early (pra1tar-doha), in the forenoon (Sam2gava), and in the evening (sa1yam2-doha). 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 3, 1. Thrice a day they were driven out to graze, according to the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 4) i. 4, 9, 2. The exact sense of this notice is obscure. Strictly speaking the cows were driven out from the cattleshed in the morning, spent the heat of the day in the Sam2gavini1, were then driven out during the evening to graze, and finally came or were driven home, as is often mentioned: Rv. i. 66, 5; 149, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 41. (pra1tah2, sam2gave, sa1yam). The first milking was productive, the last two scanty. 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 3, 1. According to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 5) iii. 18, 14. among the Bharatas the herds in the evening are in the Gos2t2ha, at midday in the Sam2gavi1ni1. This passage Sa1yan2a expands by saying that the herds go home to the S4a1la1, or house for animals, at night so far as they consist of animals giving milk, while the others stayed out in the Gos2t2ha, or open pasturage; but both were together in the cattle-shed during the heat of the day. The time before the Sam2gava, when the cows were grazing freely on the pastureland, was called Svasara. 6) Rv. ii. 2, 2; 34, 8; v. 62, 2; viii. 88, 1; ix. 94, 2. The going of the cows to their pasture in the morning is often referred to--e.g., Rv. i. 25, 16; x. 97, 8. When the cows were out feeding they were separated from the calves, which were, however, allowed to join them at the Sam2gava, 7) Rv. ii. 2, 2; viii. 88, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 1, 3; S4ankara on Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, ii. 9, 4; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 12, 4; Na1ra1yan2a on A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 12, 2. and sometimes in the evening. 8) Gobhila Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 8, 7; Rv. ii. 2, 2. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 111-114. While grazing the cattle were under the care of a herdsman (Gopa1, Gopa1la) armed with a goad, 9) Pavi1rava1n, Rv. x. 60, 3, is probably so meant. The usual name was As2t2ra1, the significant mark of a Vais4ya. Cf. Rv. vii. 33, 6. but they were liable to all sorts of dangers, such as being lost, falling into pits, breaking limbs, 10) Rv. i. 120, 8; vi. 54, 5-7. Also Pu1s2an was the special deity expected to guard cattle, and hence is called anas2t2apas4u, ‘losing no kine.’ See Rv. x. 17, 2. and Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 36. and being stolen. The marking of the ears of cattle was repeatedly adopted, no doubt, to indicate ownership. 11) Rv. vi. 28, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 9, and cf. As2t2akarn2i1 and Svadhiti. Large herds of cattle were well-known, as is shown by the Da1nastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ in the Rigveda, 12) Rv. viii. 5, 37, etc. Cf. Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 14, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 21. 23; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 8 et seq. even when allowances are made for the exaggeration of priestly gratitude. The importance attached to the possession of cattle is shown 13) Rv. i. 43, 2; 162, 22; v. 4, 11; ix. 9, 9, etc.; Av. i. 31, 4; ii. 26, 4; v. 29, 2; vi. 68, 3; viii. 7, 11; x. 1, 17. 29; xi. 2, 9. 21, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 3, 1; v. 5, 5, 1; vi. 5, 10, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 59. by the numerous passages in which the gods are asked to prosper them, and by the repeated prayers 14) Rv. i. 83, 1; iv. 32, 17; v. 4, 11; viii. 89, 2, etc. for wealth in kine. Hence, too, forays for cattle (Gavis2t2i) were well known; the Bharata host is called the ‘horde desiring cows’ (gavyan gra1mah2) in the Rigveda; 15) iii. 33, 11. and a verbal root gup, 16) Rv. vii. 103, 9; Av. x. 9, 7, 8; xix. 27, 9. 10. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 358, n. 13 ‘to protect,’ was evolved as early as the Rigveda from the denominative go-pa1ya, ‘to guard cows.’ The Vedic poets 17) Rv. vii. 32, 22; viii. 95, 1; 106, 1; ix. 12, 2, etc. do not hesitate to compare their songs with the lowing of cows, or to liken the choir of the singing Apsarases to cows. 18) Rv. x. 95, 6. It is, however, uncertain whether the names of Apsarases are meant in this passage. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 517. The cattle of the Vedic period were of many colours: red (rohita), light (s4ukra), dappled (pr2s4ni), even black (kr2s2n2a). 19) Rv. i. 62, 9. Various other colours are mentioned in the lists of animals at the As4vamedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda, but apparently as exceptional. Zimmer 20) Altindisches Leben, 226. sees a reference to cows with blazes on the face in one passage of the Rigveda, 21) i. 87, 1. It is also rendered as ‘the heavens with stars.’ but this is uncertain. Oxen were regularly used for ploughing or for drawing wagons (anad2va1h), in which case they were, it seems, usually castrated. 22) Av. iii. 9, 2; vi. 138, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8. 9, 1; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 151, n. See Maha1niras2t2a. Cows were not properly used for drawing carts, hough they at times did so. 23) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 4, 13. The flesh of both cows and bulls was sometimes eaten (Ma1msa). Cattle were certainly the objects of individual ownership, and they formed one of the standards of exchange and valuation (see Kraya). (b) The term Go is often applied to express the products of the cow. It frequently means the milk, 1) Rv. i. 33, 10; 151, 8; 181, 8; ii. 30, 7; iv. 27, 5; ix. 46, 4; 71, 5. but rarely the flesh 2) Rv. x. 16, 7 (in the funeral ritual). of the animal. In many passages it designates leather used as the material of various objects, as a bowstring, 3) Rv. vi. 75, 11; x. 27, 22; Av. i. 2, 3. or a sling, 4) Rv. i. 121, 9. or thongs to fasten part of the chariot, 5) Rv. vi. 47, 26; viii. 59. 5. or reins, 6) Rv. vi. 46, 14. or the lash of a whip. 7) Rv. vi. 53. 9. See also Carman, with which Go is sometimes synonymous. 8) Rv. x. 94. 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 228 (c) Ga1vah2 means the stars of heaven in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 154, 6; vii. 36, 1. according to Roth. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 5.

गोआङ्गिरस
2. Go A1n3girasa (‘descendant of An3giras’) is the reputed author of a Sa1man or Chant in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xvi. 7, 7. Cf. La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vi. 11, 3. There is little doubt that he is mythical. 2) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68.

 ‘a cow-killer,’ is enumerated in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 18; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 16, 1. See Ma1m2sa.

गोतम
गोतम
 is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) Rv. i. 62, 13; 78, 2; 84, 5; 85, 11; iv. 4, 11. but never in such a way as to denote personal authorship of any hymn. 2) Oldenberg. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215. It seems clear that he was closely connected with the An3girases, for the Gotamas frequently refer to An3giras. 3) Cf. Rv. i. 62, 1; 71, 2; 74, 5; 75, 2; 78, 3; iv. 2, 5; 16, 8, etc. That he bore the patronymic Ra1hu1gan2a is rendered probable by one hymn of the Rigveda, 4) Rv. i. 78, 5. Cf. Oldenberg, loc. cit., 236, n. 1. and is assumed in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 5) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq.; xi. 4, 3, 20. The former passage is wrongly cited by Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 81, 3. See Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 9, n. where he appears as the Purohita, or domestic priest, of Ma1thava Videgha, and as a bearer of Vedic civilization. He is also mentioned in the same Bra1hman2a 6) xi. 4, 3, 20. as a contemporary of Janaka of Videha, and Ya1jn5avalkya, and as the author of a Stoma. 7) xiii. 5, 1, 1; A1s4vala1vana S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 5, 6; 10, 8, etc. He occurs, moreover, in two passages of the Atharvaveda. 8) iv. 29, 6; xviii. 3, 16. See also S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a in Indische Studien, 1, 38; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 2, 6. The Gotamas are mentioned in several passages of the Rigveda, 9) i. 60, 5; 61, 16; 63, 9; 77, 5; 78, 1; 88, 4; 92, 7; iv. 32, 9. 12; viii. 88, 4. Cf. A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 10. Cf.

They include the Va1jas4ravases. See also Gautama.

गोतमीपुत्र
गोतमी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of Gotami1,’ is mentioned as a pupil of Bha1radva1ji1-putra in the Ka1n2va recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 5, 1). See also Gautami1-putra.

गोत्र
गोत्र
 occurs several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 51, 3; ii. 17, 1; 23, 18; iii. 39, 4; 43, 7; viii. 74, 5; x. 48, 2; 103, 7. in the account of the mythic exploits of Indra. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. interprets the word as ‘cowstall,’ while Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 275, 276, where he divides the passages according as real or mythical herds are meant. thinks ‘herd’ is meant. The latter sense seems to explain best the employment which the term shows in the later literature as denoting the ‘family’ or ‘clan,’ and which is found in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 4) iv. 4, 1. So S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra; i. 4, 16, etc.; A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 4, etc.; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxv. 15. In the Gr2hya Su1tras 5) Gobhila Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 4, 4; A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, ii. 5, 11, 15. 16, in Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 387. For sapin2d2a, see Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xiv. 13; Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, iv. 17-19. stress is laid on the prohibition of marriage within a Gotra, or with a Sapin2d2a of the mother of the bridegroom--that is to say, roughly, with agnates and cognates. Senart 6) Les Castes dans l'Inde, 210 et seq. Cf. De la Valle4e Poussin, Le Ve4disme, 15. has emphasized this fact as a basis of caste, on the ground that marriage within a curia, phratria, or caste (Varn2a) was Indo-European, as was marriage outside the circle of agnates and cognates. But there is no evidence at all 7) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 471, 472. to prove that this practice was Indo-European, while in India the S4atapatha 8) i. 8, 3, 6. expressly recognizes marriage within the third or fourth degree on either side. According to Sa1yan2a, the Ka1n2vas accepted marriage in the third degree, the Saura1s2t2ras only in the fourth, while the scholiast on the Vajrasu1ci1 9) See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 73-76. add2s to the Ka1n2vas the Andhras and the Da1ks2in2a1tyas, and remarks that the Va1jasaneyins forbade marriage with the daughter of the mother's brother. All apparently allowed marriage with the daughter of a paternal uncle, which later was quite excluded. Change of Gotra was quite possible, as in the case of S4unah2s4epa and Gr2tsamada, who, once an An3girasa, became a Bha1rgava. 10) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 157; Festgruss an Roth, 108. Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 61 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 323.

गोदान
गो-दान
 appears to mean ‘the whiskers’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) iii. 1, 2, 5, 6. where the person, being consecrated, first shaves off the right and then the left ‘whisker.’ Later on the Goda1navidhi, or ceremony of shaving the head, is a regular part of the initiation of a youth on the attainment of manhood and on marriage; 2) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 19; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 28, etc. but though the ceremony is recognized in the Atharvaveda, 3) vi. 68. See Kaus4ika Su1tra, liii. 1720. But Av. ii. 13 is not to be classed here as in the Kaus4ika; it refers to the giving of a new garment to a child, and the removal of its first wrap. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 56, 57, correcting Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 173, and Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 322, 323. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 306, 574, 665. the name 4) The meaning ‘whisker’ is a secondary one, derived, doubtless, from the ‘gift of a cow’ (go-da1na), accompanying the ceremony of shaving the whiskers or hair. does not occur there. 

गोधा
गोधा
 --(a) The sense of ‘bowstring’ seems certain in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 28, 10. 11. and possible in another. 2) viii. 69, 9. See Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 53. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1. also adopts this meaning in the only passage of the Atharvaveda 4) iv. 3, 6. where the word occurs. (b) In one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 69, 9. the sense of ‘musical instrument’ is recognized by Roth and by Hillebrandt 2) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 144, n. 1. for this word. (c) Elsewhere 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 15, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 35; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 2, 14; Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 5; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 221; S4a1t2ya1yanaka in Sa1yan2a on Rv. viii. 91; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 29. an animal seems to be meant, perhaps the ‘crocodile,’ as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 499. and Weber 3) Indische Studien, 18, 15, 16. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 368, renders the word vaguely by ‘dragon.’ think; perhaps a large ‘lizard,’ as Roth and Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 95. assume. An animal is probably also meant in the Atharvaveda. 5) iv. 3, 6, where Whitney offers no rendering at all.

गोधूम
गो-धूम,
 ‘wheat,’ is frequently referred to in the plural in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 2, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 12; xix. 22. 89; xxi. 29, etc. and Bra1hman2as, 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 7, 1, 2; 2, 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 22 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 3, 13 Ka1n2va), etc. and is expressly distinguished from ‘rice’ (Vri1hi) or ‘barley’ (Yava). 3) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 7, 2. ‘Groats’ (saktavah2) made of this grain are also mentioned. 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 9, 1, 5. The word occurs in the singular in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 5) v. 2, 1, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 241.

गोपति
गो-पति,
 ‘lord of cows,’ is freely used in the Rigveda 1) i. 101, 4; iv. 24, 1; vi. 45, 21; vii. 18, 4, etc. Av. iii. 14, 6, etc. to denote any lord or master, a natural usage considering that cattle formed the main species of wealth. 

गोपवन
गोप-वन
 is the name of a poet of the race of Atri in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 74, 11. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 215; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. See Gaupavana.

गोपा
गो-पा
 and Go-pa1la, ‘protector of cows,’ occur in the Rigveda 1) Gopa1: Rv. i. 164, 21; ii. 23, 6; iii. 10, 2; v. 12, 4, etc.; Gopa1la: Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 4. Gopa1, in the sense of ‘guardian,’ occurs in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 18, in a compound. Gopi1tha, in the sense of ‘protection,’ occurs in Rv. v. 65, 6; x. 35, 14, etc. Goptr2, ‘protector,’ first occurs in Av. x. 10, 5, and is thereafter common. and later, but the former is usually metaphorical in sense, applying to any protector, while the latter has the literal force of ‘cow-herd.’

गोबल
गो-बल
 (‘ox-strength’) Va1rs2n2a (‘descendant of Vr2s2n2i’) is mentioned as a teacher in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (iii. 11, 9, 3) and the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (i. 6, 1).

गोमती
गो-मती,
 ‘possessing cows,’ is mentioned as a river in the Nadi1-stuti, or ‘Praise of Rivers,’ in the tenth Man2d2ala of the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 6. In that hymn a river flowing into the Indus must be meant, and its identification 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. with the Gomal, a western tributary of the Indus, cannot be doubted. In one other passage of the Rigveda 3) viii. 24. 30. the accentuation of Gomati shows that a river is meant. It is possible that in a third passage 4) v. 61, 19. See Oldenberg, R2gvedaNoten. 1, 355, 356. the reading should be changed to gomati4r from go4mati1r. Geldner 5) Vedische Studien, 3, 152, n. 2. suggests that in the two last passages the Gumti, or rather its four upper arms (hence the use of the plural) is meant: this accords well with the later use of the name and with the general probability of the river here intended being in Kuruks2etra, as the centre of Vedic civilization. 6) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 19 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 174; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 1141.

गोमृग
गो-मृग,
 a species of ox, now called Gayal (Bos gavaeus), is mentioned in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 11; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 1. 30. and Bra1hman2as. 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 4, 3; 5, 2, 10; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 20, 5. In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) ii. 1, 10, 2 it is declared to be neither a wild nor a tame animal; this presumably means that it was semidomesticated, or perhaps that it was both tamed and found wild. With the name of this animal may be compared the Mr2ga Mahis2a, which is clearly mentioned as wild in the Rigveda. 4) ix. 92, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83, 84; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 338, n. 1. See also Gayava.

This sense suits adequately all the passages of the Rigveda 4) i. 191, 4; vi. 28, 1; viii. 43, 17. where it occurs, and it greatly improves the interpretation of a hymn of the Atharvaveda, 5) iii. 14, 1. 5. 6, where Whitney's rendering ‘stall’ is very unsatisfactory, and Bloomfield's ‘stable’ is no better. besides being acceptable elsewhere. 6) Av. ii. 26, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 21; v. 17; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 8, 3, 2, etc.; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, vii. 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 11.

St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30. of a teacher who appears to have been needlessly invented to explain the Gaus2u1kta Sa1man (chant), which is really the Sa1man of Gos2u1ktin.

ग्रह
ग्रह
 (‘seizing’) is a term applied to the sun in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) iv. 6, 5, 1. most probably not in the later sense of ‘planet,’ but to denote a power exercising magical influence. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 432, n. 2. The sense of ‘planet’ seems first to occur in the later literature, as in the Maitra1yan2i1 Upanis2ad. 3) vi. 16. See Weber, Indian Literature, 98, n. The question whether the planets were known to the Vedic Indians is involved in obscurity. Oldenberg 4) Religion des Veda, 185 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 50, 56 et seq. recognizes them in the A1dityas, whose number is, he believes, seven; sun, moon, and the five planets. But this view, though it cannot be said to be impossible or even unlikely, is not susceptible of proof, and has been rejected by Hillebrandt, 5) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 102 et seq. Pischel, 6) Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anxeigen, 1895. 447. von Schroeder, 7) Vienna Oriental Journal, 9, 109. Macdonell, 8) Vedic Mythology, p. 44. and Bloomfield, 9) Religion of the Veda, 133 et seq. among others. Hillebrandt 10) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 423. sees the planets in the five Adhvaryus mentioned in the Rigveda, 11) iii. 7, 7. but this is a mere conjecture. The five bulls (uks2a1n2ah2) in another passage of the Rigveda 12) i. 105, 10. Cf. also i. 105, 16, with Oldenberg's note. have received a similar interpretation with equal uncertainty, 13) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 36. and Durga, in his commentary on the Nirukta, 14) i. 14. even explains the term bhu1mija, ‘earth-born,’ which is only mentioned by Ya1ska, as meaning the planet Mars. 15) See Weber, Jyotis2a, 10, n. 2. Thibaut, 16) Astronomie, Astrologie, und Mathematik, 6. who is generally sceptical as to the mention of planets in the Veda, thinks that Br2haspati there refers to Jupiter; but this is extremely improbable, though in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 17) iv. 4 10, 1. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 102-104. Br2haspati is made the regent of Tis2ya. A reference to the planets is much more probable in the seven suns (sapta su1rya1h2) of the late Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 18) i. 7. See on them Weber, Omina und Portenta, 339; Indische Studien, 2, 238; 9, 363; 10, 240, 271; Jyotis2a, 10; Ra1ma1yan2a, 28, n. 2. On the other hand, Ludwig's efforts to find the five planets with the sun, the moon, and the twenty-seven Naks2atras (lunar mansions) in the Rigveda, as corresponding to the number thirty-four used in connexion with light 19) x. 55, 3. (jyotis) and the ribs of the sacrificial horse, 20) i. 162, 18. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 183 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 354 et seq.; Max Mu7ller, R2gveda, iv. 2, xxx. et seq.; Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 412, n.

ग्राम
ग्राम
 --The primitive sense of this word, which occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) i. 44, 10; 114, 1; ii. 12, 7 (perhaps to be taken as in n. 10); x. 146, 1; 149, 4, etc.; Av. iv. 36, 7, 8; v. 17, 4; vi. 40, 2, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 45; xx. 17, etc. onwards, appears to have been ‘village.’ The Vedic Indians must have dwelt in villages which were scattered over the country, some close together, 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 4, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 44. some far apart, and were connected by roads. 3) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 6, 2. The village is regularly contrasted with the forest (aran2ya), and its animals and plants with those that lived or grew wild in the woods. 4) Animals: Rv. x. 90, 8; Av. ii. 34, 4; iii. 10, 6; 31, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 2, 2, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, vii. 7; xiii. 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 32; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 1, 9; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 8. 4, 16, etc. Plants: Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 5, 5; vii. 3, 4, 1, etc. The villages contained cattle, horses, and other domestic animals, as well as men. 5) Av. iv. 22, 2; viii. 7, 11, etc. Grain was also stored in them. 6) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 13 (Ka1n2va = 22, Ma1dhyam2dina). In the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the forest. 7) Rv. x. 149, 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 1. The villages were probably open, though perhaps a fort (Pur) might on occasion be built inside. 8) As nowadays. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 144, citing Hu7gel, Kashmir, 2, 45. Presumably they consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (maha1gra1ma1h2) were known. 9) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 13. 4. The relation of the villagers is difficult to ascertain with precision. In several passages 10) Rv. i. 100, 10; iii. 33, 11; x. 27, 1; 127, 5; Av. iv. 7, 5; v. 20, 3 (where, however, ‘villages’ is quite probable); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 2; vi. 7, 4, 9; xii. 4, 1, 3. Cf. n. 1. the word occurs with what appears to be the derivative sense of ‘body of men.’ This sense presumably started from the use of the word to denote the ‘village folk,’ as when S4arya1ta Ma1nava is said in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 11) iv. 1, 5, 2. 7. to have wandered about with his ‘village’ (gra1men2a); but, as Zimmer 12) Altindisches Leben, 161. observes, this restricted sense nowhere appears clearly in the Rigveda, 13) See passages cited in n. 10. where indeed the ‘folk’ (jana) 14) Rv. iii. 53, 12. of the Bharatas is in one passage 15) Rv. iii. 33, 11. called the ‘horde seeking cows’ (gavyan gra1mah2). Zimmer 16) Op. cit., 159, 160, where, however, his language is not very clear. Cf. Hopkins, Religions of India, 27, who points out that Zimmer is inaccurate in identifying the tribe with Vis4. It is the clan, a division below that of the tribe (Jana). tends to regard the Gra1ma as a clan, and as standing midway between the family and the tribe (Vis4). The Gra1ma may, however, perhaps be regarded more correctly 17) A village might contain a whole clan, but probably it contained at most a section of a clan. By family is meant a Hindu joint family; but the extent to which such families existed, and the number of persons included, cannot even be conjectured from the avail able evidence. Cf. Schrader, Prchistoric Antiquities, 393; Leist, Altarisches Jos Gentium, 34. as an aggregate of several families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan (Vis4), as is often the case at the present day. 18) Cf. Baden Powell, Village Communities in India, 85 et seq. Vedic literature tells us very little about the social economy of the village. There is nothing to show that the community as such held land. What little evidence there is indicates that individual tenure of land was known (see Urvara1, Ks2etra), but this, in effect though not in law, presumably meant tenure by a family rather than by an individual person. The expression ‘desirous of a village’ (gra1ma-ka1ma), which occurs frequently in the later Sam2hita1s, 19) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 1, 2; 3, 2; 3, 9, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 9; 2, 3; iv. 2, 7, etc.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 32, thinks that gra1ma here means ‘herd’ (of cattle). points, however, to the practice of the king's granting to his favourites his royal prerogatives over villages so far as fiscal matters were concerned. Later 20) Cf. Baden Powell, Indian Village Community, 207 et seq. Whether or not the idea is already found in Manu, ix. 34, is disputed and uncertain. See Ra1jan. The germ of it lies in a different sphere--the right of the Ks2atriya, with the consent of the clan, to apportion land (S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 1, 1, 8). the idea developed that the king was owner of all the land, and parallel with that idea the view that the holders of such grants were landlords. But of either idea there is no vestige in Vedic literature beyond the word gra1ma-ka1ma, which much more probably refers to the grant of regalia than to the grant of land, as Teutonic parallels show. 21) Cf. Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, 2, 237 et seq.; Baden Powell, Village Communities in India, 83; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 48. It may be mentioned that we have no Vedic evidence as to the non-sale of land by the members of a family, except the indications mentioned under Urvara1. The later evidence is overwhelming for gra1ma, meaning ‘village.’ Cf. Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 2, 4; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 14; Kaus4ika Su1tra, 94. Such grants probably tended to depress the position of the actual cultivators, and to turn them into tenants, but they can hardly have had this effect to any appreciable extent in early times. The village does not appear to have been a unit for legal purposes in early days, 22) Cf. Foy, Die ko7nigliche Gewalt, 20, n.; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 93; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 78, 128. and it can hardly be said to have been a political unit. The village no doubt, as later, included in its members various menials, besides the cultivating owners, and also the Bra1hman2as and Ks2atriyas who might hold interest in it by royal grant or usage without actually cultivating land, such as chariot-makers (Ratha-ka1ra), carpenters (Taks2an), smiths (Karma1ra), and others, but they did not presumably, in any sense, form part of the brotherhood. 23) Cf. Baden Powell, Indian Village Community, 17, 18. All alike were politically subject to the king, and bound to render him food or service or other tribute, unless he had transferred his rights to others of the royal family or household, as was no doubt often the case, either in whole or part. The king's share in a village is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda. 24) iv. 22, 2. Cf. n. 20. At the head of the village was the Gra1ma-n2i1, or ‘leader of the village,’ who is referred to in the Rigveda, 25) x. 62, 11; 107, 5. and often in the later Sam2hita1s and in the Bra1hman2as. 26) Av. iii. 5, 7; xix. 31, 12; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 4, 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 5 (gra1ma-n2i1thya, ‘the rank of Gra1man2i1’: cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 5, 2); Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 4; x. 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 15; xxx. 20; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 8; 7, 3, 4; ii. 7, 18, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 7; v. 4, 4, 8; viii. 6, 2, 1 (gra1man2i1thya); Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 37. 38, etc. The exact meaning of the title is not certain. By Zimmer 27) Altindisches Leben, 171. the Gra1man2i1 is regarded as having had military functions only, and he is certainly often connected with the Sena1ni1, or ‘leader of an army.’ But there is no reason so to restrict the sense: presumably the Gra1man2i1 was the head of the village both for civil purposes and for military operations. He is ranked in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 28) v. 4, 4, 18. as inferior to the Su1ta, or ‘charioteer,’ with whom, however, he is associated 29) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 5. as one of the Ratnins, the ‘jewels’ of the royal establishment. The post was especially valuable to a Vais4ya, who, if he attained it, was at the summit of prosperity (gatas4ri1). 30) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 4, 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 20, n. 2. The Gra1man2i1's connexion with the royal person seems to point to his having been a nominee of the king rather than a popularly elected officer. But the post may have been sometimes hereditary, and sometimes nominated or elective: there is no decisive evidence available. The use of the singular presents difficulties: possibly the Gra1man2i1 of the village or city where the royal residence was situated was specially honoured and influential. 31) Presumably, there must have been many Gra1man2i1s in a kingdom, but the texts seem to contemplate only one as in the royal entourage. Cf. also Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 60, n.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 96; Rhys Davids, op. cit., 48, thinks that he was elected by the village council or a hereditary officer, because the appointment is only claimed for the king in late authorities like Manu, vii. 115. But there is not even so much authority for election or heredity, and we really cannot say how far the power of the early princes extended: it probably varied very much. Cf. Ra1jan and Citraratha. 

ग्राम्यवादिन्
ग्राम्य-वादिन्
 apparently means a ‘village judge’ in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 1, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 4; Maitra1yani1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 1. His Sabha1, ‘court,’ is mentioned in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1.

ग्राह
ग्राह,
 ‘the seizer,’ is the name of a disease in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) iii. 5, 3, 25; 6, 1, 25. In the Atharvaveda 2) xi. 9, 12. it perhaps means ‘paralysis’ of the thigh. 3) If the reading of the commentary u1ru-gra1haih2 be adopted; but Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 653, retaining the reading of the text urugra1haih2, renders the compound as an adjective, ‘wide-gripping.’ Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 635.

ग्राहि
ग्राहि,
 ‘the seizer,’ appears in the Rigveda 1) x. 161, 1. and the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 9, 1; 10, 6. 8; vi. 112, 1; 113, 1; viii. 2, 12; 3, 18; xvi. 7, 1; 8, 1; xix. 45, 5. as a female demon of disease. Her son is sleep (svapna). 3) xvi. 5, 1; or perhaps ‘dream’ is meant. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 154.

 in the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 25, 2; vii. 76, 2. Cf. Bloomfield, Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1887, xix.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 472. appears to denote ‘tumours on the neck’ (gri1va1h2).

ग्लह
ग्लह
 denotes the ‘throw’ at dice, like Gra1bha, of which it is a later form, occurring in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 28, 1 et seq. Cf. Lu7ders, Das Wu7rfelspiel im alten Indien, 49.

ग्लावमैत्रेय
ग्लाव मैत्रेय
 (‘descendant of Maitri1’) is mentioned in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 1) i. 12, 1. 3. Cf. Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 31. where he is said to be the same as Vaka Da1lbhya. He appears as Pratistotr2 at the snake festival of the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 2) xxv. 15, 3. and is referred to in the S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) i. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35, 38. 

ग्लौ
ग्लौ
 occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 83, 3. and in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 2) i. 25. as the name of some symptom of a disease, probably, as Bloomfield 3) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1887, xv.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 17, 503; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 343. thinks, ‘boils.’ In the one passage of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita, 4) xxv. 8; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 15, 7. where it is found the sense is obscure, some part of the sacrificial victim being perhaps meant. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 500, takes glau as ‘owl.’ Cf. Galunta. GH.

घर्म
घर्म
 denotes in the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 14; v. 30, 15; 43, 7; 76, 1, etc. and later 2) Av. vii. 73, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 61; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 18. 22, etc. the pot used for heating milk, especially for the offering to the As4vins. It hence often 3) Rv. i. 119, 2; 180, 4; vii. 70, 2; viii. 9, 4, etc.; Av. iv. 1, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxviii. 6, etc. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 32; xi. 42; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. denotes the hot milk itself, or some other hot drink.

घास
घास
 means ‘fodder’ in the Atharvaveda 1) Av. iv. 38, 7; viii. 7, 8; xi. 5, 18, etc. and later. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 75; xxi. 43; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 9, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 10, etc. In the Rigveda 3) i. 162, 14. Gha1si is used of the fodder of the horse victim at the As4vamedha.

घृणीवन्त्
घृणीवन्त्
 is the name of some animal in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 1) xxiv. 39. In the parallel passage of the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 2) iii. 14, 20. Ghr2n2a1vant is the reading. Elsewhere the word is adjectival. 3) Rv. x. 176, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. 

घृत
घृत,
 the modern Ghee or ‘clarified butter,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 134, 6; ii. 10, 4; iv. 10, 6; 58, 5. 7. 9; v. 12, 1, etc. and later 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 22, etc.; Av. iii. 13, 5, etc.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 1, 7 (with Dadhi, Mastu, Amiks2a1); ix. 2, 1, 1 (Dadhi, Madhu, Ghr2ta), etc. both as in ordinary use and as a customary form of sacrifice. According to a citation in Sa1yan2a's commentary on the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 3) i. 3 (p. 240, edition Aufrecht). the distinction between Ghr2ta and Sarpis consisted in the latter being butter fully melted, while the former was butter melted and hardened (ghani1-bhu1ta), but this distinction cannot be pressed. Because the butter was thrown into the fire, Agni is styled ‘butter-faced’ (ghr2ta-prati1ka), 4) Rv. i. 143, 7; iii. 1, 18; v. 11, 1; x. 21, 7, etc. ‘butter-backed’ (ghr2ta-pr2s2t2ha), 5) Rv. i. 164, 1; v. 4, 3; 37, 1; vii. 2, 4, etc. and ‘propitiated with butter’ (ghr2ta-prasatta), 6) Rv. v. 15. 1. and ‘found of butter’ (ghr2ta-pri1). 7) Av. xii. 1, 20; xviii. 4, 41. Water was used to purify the butter: the waters were therefore called ‘butter-cleansing’ (ghr2ta-pu1). 8) i. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a^9 it is said that A1jya, Ghr2ta, A1yuta, and Navani1ta pertain to gods, men, Pitr2s, and embryos respectively.

घृतकौशिक
घृत-कौशिक
 is mentioned in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) of the Ma1dhyam2dina recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) ii. 5. 21; iv. 5, 27. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 384. as a pupil of Pa1ra1s4arya1yan2a.

घोरआङ्गिरस
घोर आङ्गिरस
 is the name of a mythical teacher in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 1) xxx. 6. Cf. A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su7tra, xii. 10. and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 2) iii. 17, 6. where he is teacher of the strange Kr2s2n2a Devaki1putra. That the name is certainly a mere figment is shown by the fact that this ‘dread descendant of the An3girases’ has a counterpart in Bhis2aj A1tharvan2a, 3) Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 459. ‘the healing descendant of the Atharvans,’ while in the Rigveda Su1tras 4) A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 7; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 2; Journal of the American Oriental Society. 17, 181. the Atharva1n2o vedah2 is connected with bhes2ajam and the A1n3giraso vedah2 with ghoram. He is accordingly a personification of the dark side of the practice of the Atharvaveda. 5) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xx, xxi, xxxviii; Atharvaveda, 8, 23; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 189, 190; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160, n. 4. He is also mentioned in the As4vamedha section of the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 6) i. 1.

घोषा
घोषा
 is mentioned as a prote4ge4e of the As4vins in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 117, 7; x. 40, 5. Cf. x. 39, 3. 6. probably as the recipient of a husband, who is perhaps referred to in another passage 2) i. 122, 5. See Oldenberg, R2gvedaNoten, 1, 123. as Arjuna, though this is not likely. Sa1yan2a finds a reference there to a skin disease, which is considered in the later tradition of the Br2haddevata1 3) vii. 41-48, with Macdonell's notes. to have been the cause of her remaining unwed, but this view is not tenable. According to Sa1yan2a, her son, Suhastya, is alluded to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda; 4) i. 120, 5. Oldenberg, 5) Op. cit., 119. Suhastya is apparently invented from x. 41, 3, probably assisted by the fact that Vadhrimati1 was given a son, Hiran2yahasta, by the As4vins (Rv. i. 117, 24). however, here sees a reference to Ghos2a1 herself, while Pischel 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 4; 2, 92. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 143; U7ber Methode bei Interpretation des Rigveda, 43; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 247; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 52. thinks that the form (ghos2e) is not a noun at all, but verbal. C.

चक
चक
 is mentioned with Pis4an3ga as one of the two Unnetr2 priests at the snake festival in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35. who reads Cakka; 10, 142. n. 3, 144 

चक्र
चक्र,
 the ‘wheel’ of a chariot or wagon, is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda 1) i. 130, 9; 155, 6; 164, 2. 11. 14; 174, 5; iv. 1, 3, etc. onwards, often in a metaphorical sense. The wheel was fixed on the axle (Aks2a) when the chariot was required for use; this required considerable strength, as is shown by a reference in the Rigveda. 2) Av. xi. 7, 4; xix. 53, 1. 2, etc. The wheel consisted normally of spokes (Ara), and a nave (Na1bhi), 3) Rv. viii. 41, 6. in the opening (Kha) of which the end of the axle (A1n2i) was inserted. An indication of the importance attached to the strength of the wheel is the celebration of the car of the god Pu1s2an as having a wheel that suffers no damage. 4) Rv. vi. 54, 3. The usual number of wheels was two, 5) Rv. viii. 5, 29; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 16, 5; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 4. but in seven passages of the Rigveda 6) i. 118, 2; 157, 3; 183, 1; viii. 58, 3; x. 41, 1; 85, 14 (all of the As4vins' chariot); iv. 36, 1 (of a chariot made by the R2bhus, who are three in number). a chariot is called ‘three-wheeled,’ in a few others ‘sevenwheeled,’ 7) Rv. i. 164, 3, 12; ii. 40, 3. while in one of the Atharvaveda 8) xi. 4, 22. it is styled ‘eightwheeled.’ Zimmer 9) Altindisches Leben, viii., ix. argues that these epithets do not refer to real chariots, pointing out that in all the passages where tri-cakra, ‘three-wheeled,’ occurs there is a mythical reference. On the other hand, Weber 10) Proceedings of the Berlin Acadcmy, 1898, 564, quoting Virchow, Zeistchrift fu7r Ethnologie, 5, 200. thinks that there might have been chariots with three wheels, one being in the centre between the two occupants. This is not very conclusive; at any rate, the seven-wheeled and the eight-wheeled chariots can hardly be regarded as indicating the existence of real vehicles with that number of wheels. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 11) xi. 8, 1, 1. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 247. the potter's wheel (kaula1lacakra) is referred to.

चक्रवाक
चक्र-वाक
 is the name, apparently derived from the nature of its cry, of a species of gander (Anas casarca), the modern Chakwa1, as it is called in Hindi1, or Brahmany duck in English. 1) Criffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 309, n. 4. It is mentioned in the Rigveda 2) ii. 39, 3. and in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda, 3) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 3. 13; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 22. 32; xxv. 8. while in the Atharvaveda 4) xiv. 2, 64. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 89. it already appears as the type of conjugal fidelity, its characteristic in the classical literature.

चक्षुस्
चक्षुस्,
 ‘eye.’ The ‘evil eye’ (ghoram2 caks2us) was well known in the Atharvaveda, which contains spells to counteract its influence. 1) ii. 7; xix. 45, are so employed in the ritual. As remedies against it are mentioned salve from Mount Trikakubh 2) Av. iv. 9, 6. and the Jan3gid2a plant. 3) Av. xix. 35, 3. In the wedding ceremony the wife is entreated not to have the evil eye (aghoracaks2us). 4) Pa1raskara Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 4; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 16. The structure of the eye, and its division into white (s4ukla), dark (kr2s2n2a), and the pupil (kani1n ika1) are repeatedly referred to in the later Bra1hman2as. 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 8, 2, 26; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 254. 324; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 26, 1; 34, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 2, 2; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 1, 5, etc. So the man (puru 1) in the eye is repeatedly mentioned: Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 7, 5; iv. 15, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 3, 5; iv. 2, 2; v. 5, 2. 4, etc.; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 27, 2. The Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 2, 3, adds the water (a1pah2) in the eye, the upper and the lower lids (vartani1), and seven red lines (lohinyo ra1jayah2). Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 149. The desease Alaji appears to have been an affection of the eyes.

चण्डाल
चण्डाल,
 1) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 10, 7; 14, 4; A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 9; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, ii. 12; vi. 1, etc. Ca1n2d2a1la, 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 21; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 17, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 22. are the variant forms of the name of a despised caste, which in origin was probably a tribal body, 3) Fick, Die sociale Gliederung. 204 et seq. but which in the Brahminical theory was the offspring of S4u1dra athers and Brahmin mothers. 4) Apparently accepted for the Vedic period by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 217. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Litcratur und Cultur, 433. The references to the caste in he Yajurveda Sam2hita1s and in the Upanis2ads show clearly hat it was a degraded one, but they yield no particulars. 

चतुष्पद्
चतुष्-पद्,
 ‘quadruped,’ is a regular name for animals from the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 49, 3; 94, 5; 119, 1; iii. 62, 14, etc.; Av. iv. 11, 5; x. 8, 21; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 30; ix. 31; xiv. 8. 25, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 2; viii. 20, etc. onwards, being frequently contrasted with Dvipad, ‘biped.’ 2) Rv. x. 117, 8; Av. vi. 107, 1, etc. Catus2-pa1da, as an adjective applying to pas4avah2, ‘animals,’ is also found. 3) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 18; vi. 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, 3, 2; vi. 8, 2, 17, etc.

चन्द्र
1. Candra, 1) Av. ii. 15, 2; 22, 1; iii. 31, 6, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 28; xxxix. 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 2, 16, etc. Candra-mas, 2) Rv. i. 105, 1; viii. 82, 8; x. 64, 3; 85, 19; Av. xi. 6, 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 28; xxiii. 10. 59, etc. are the names of the ‘moon,’ the latter occurring from the Rigveda onwards, but the former being first used in this sense by the Atharvaveda. Very little is said about the moon in Vedic literature, except as identified with Soma, 3) See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 112, 113. The identification is clearly found in the later parts of the Rigveda. both alike being described as waxing and waning. Reference is, however, made to the regular changes of the moon, and to its alternation with the sun, 5) Rv. x. 68, 10. Cf. i. 62, 8; 72, 10. to which it, as Soma, is declared in the Rigveda to be married. 6) x. 85, 18. 19. Mention is also made of its disappearance at the time of new moon, 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 4, 18; iv. 6, 7, 12; xi. 1, 6, 19; xiv. 4, 2, 13; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 28, 8; perhaps Rv. x. 138, 4. and of its birth from the light of the sun. 8) Rv. ix. 71, 9; 76, 4; 86, 32; Sa1maveda, ii. 9, 2, 12, 1; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 463 et seq. Cf. Su1rya. In the Atharvaveda 9) xix. 9, 10. Av. vi. 128 is also regarded by the Kaus4ika Su1tra, c. 3, as referring to an eclipse of the moon. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 533. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 349, 350, 352. reference is made to demons eclipsing the moon (graha1s4 ca1ndrama1sa1h2). For the phases of the moon, and the month as a measure of time, see Ma1sa. For the moon and its mansions, see Naks2atra. ^4) Rv. x. 55, 5. Cf. Av. x. 8, 32.

चन्द्र
2. Candra appears to denote ‘gold’ in a certain number of passages from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. ii. 2, 4; iii. 31, 5; Av. xii. 2, 53; Jaittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 2, 7, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ii. 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 26; xix. 93; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 3, 4, etc. Cf. the adjective candrin in Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 37; xxxi. 31. 

चप्य
चप्य
 is found in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xix. 88; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxviii. 3. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xii. 7, 2, 13; 9, 1, 3. as the name of a sacrificial vessel.

चमस
चमस
 denotes a ‘drinking vessel,’ usually as employed for holding Soma at the sacrifice. It is frequently mentioned from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 20, 6; 110, 3; viii. 82, 7; x. 16, 8; 68, 8; 96, 9, etc.; Av. vii. 73, 3; xviii. 3, 54; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 13, etc.; Nirukta, xi. 2; xii. 38. It was made of wood (vr2ks2a), 2) Rv. x. 68, 8. and is hence called dru. 3) Rv. i. 161, 1. According to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 4) vii. 2, 11, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 280; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 167, 168. it was made of Udumbara wood.

चमू
चमू
 is a term of somewhat doubtful sense occurring repeatedly in the Rigveda, and connected with the preparation of Soma. Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 277, 278. considers that in the dual it denotes the two boards between which, in his opinion, the Soma was crushed (cf. Adhis2avan2a). Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Grassmann, Rigveda, 1, 15. however, appears to be right in taking the normal sense to designate a vessel into which the Soma was poured from the press, and Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 164-175. shows clearly that when it occurs in the plural 4) Rv. iii. 48, 5; viii. 2, 8; 82, 7. 8; ix. 20, 6; 62, 16; 63, 2; 92, 2; 93, 3; 97, 21. 37. 46; 99, 6. 8. it always has this sense, corresponding to the Graha-pa1tras of the later ritual, and that sometimes it is so used in the singular 5) Rv. ix. 107, 18; x. 91, 15. or dual 6) Rv. ix. 69, 5; 71, 1; 72, 5; 86, 47; 96, 20. 21; 97 2. 48; 103, 4; 107, 10; 108. 10. also. In some cases, 7) Singular: Rv. v. 51, 4; viii. 4, 4; 76, 10; ix. 46, 3; x. 24, 1. Dual: i. 28, 9; iv. 18, 3; vi. 57, 2; ix. 36, 1. however, he recognizes its use as denoting the mortar in which the Soma was pressed: he may be right here, as this mode of preparation was probably Indo-Iranian. 8) Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 158-164. In a derivative sense Camu1 appears in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 9) xiii. 8, 2, 1; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 430, n. 1. In S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiv. 22, 19, the sense is doubtful. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 105 et seq. to denote a trough, either of solid stone or consisting of bricks, used by the Eastern people to protect the body of the dead from contact with the earth, like modern stone-lined graves or vaults.

चरक
चरक
 primarily denotes a ‘wandering student,’ a sense actually found in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) iii. 3, 1. More especially it denotes the members of a school of the Black Yajurveda, the practices of which are several times referred to with disapproval in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 2) iii. 8, 2, 24 (where the reference is to Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 vi. 3, 9, 6; 10, 2, or some parallel passage); iv. 1, 2, 19; 2, 3, 15; 4, 1, 10; vi. 2, 2, 1. 10; viii. 1, 3, 7; 7, 1, 14. 24. In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 3) xxx. 18; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 16, 1. Its occurrence in the latter text renders improbable von Schroeder's view, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 188, that Caraka included all the Black Yajurveda schools. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 287, n. 2; 3, 256, 257, 454; Indian Literature. 87; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 212. the Caraka teacher (Caraka1ca1rya) is enumerated among the sacrificial victims at the Purus2amedha, or human sacrifice. His dedication there to ill-doing is a clear hint of a ritual feud.

चरकब्राह्मण
चरक-ब्राह्मण
 is the name of a work from which Sa1yan2a quotes in his commentary on the Rigveda. 1) viii. 66, 10; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 41.

चराचर
चराचर
 (‘running about’), a term found classed with Sari1sr2pa in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 13, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 12, 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 29. must apparently denote some kind of animal.

चरु
चरु
 designates a ‘kettle’ or ‘pot’ from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 7, 6; vii. 104, 2; ix. 52, 3; x. 86, 18; 167, 4; Av. iv. 7, 4; ix. 5, 6; xi. 1, 16; 3, 18; xviii. 4, 16 et seq., etc. It is called pan5ca-bild, ‘with five openings,’ in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 1, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, v. 6; xxxii. 6; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 4. 9, etc. It had a lid (apidha1na) and hooks (an3ka) by which it could be hung over a fire. 2) Rv. i. 162, 13; Av. xviii. 4, 53. It was made of iron or bronze 3) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 4, 5 Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271. (ayasmaya). The word is also secondarily used 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 10, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 4, 7; ii. 5, 3, 4; iii. 2, 3, 1, etc. Cf. Weber, Ina1ische Studien, 9, 216. to denote the contents of the pot, the mess of grain which was cooked in it.

 denoting ‘hide’ in general, is a common expression from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 85, 5; 110, 8; 161, 7; iii. 60, 2; iv. 13, 4, etc.; Av. v. 8, 13; x. 9, 2; xi. 1, 9, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 7, 1; vi. 1, 9, 2, etc. The stem carma, neuter (loc., carme), is found in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 2, 2. The oxhide was turned to many uses, such as the manufacture of bowstrings, slings, and reins (see Go). It was especially often employed to place above the boards 2) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 148-150; 181-183. on which the Soma was pressed with the stones. 3) Rv. x. 94, 9; 116, 4. It was possibly also used for making skin bags. 4) Rv. x. 106, 10, is so taken by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben. 228, who compares Odyssey, x. 19. Carman2ya denotes leather-work generally in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 5) v. 32. Cf. paricarman2ya, Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, ii. 1. The art of tanning hides (mla1) was known as early as the Rigveda, 6) viii. 55, 3 (a late hymn). where also the word for ‘tanner’ (carmamna) occurs. 7) viii. 5, 38; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 15; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 13, 1. For the form, cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 38, n. 1; p. 249, n. 4. Details of the process are lacking, but the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 8) ii. 1, 1, 9. refers to stretching out a hide with pegs (s4an5kubhih2), and the Rigveda 9) i. 85, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 228, 253. mentions the wetting of the hide.

चर्षणि
चर्षणि,
 used in the plural, denotes in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 86, 5; 184, 4; iii. 43, 2; iv. 7, 4; v. 23, 1; vi. 2, 2; x. 180, 3, etc. ‘men’ in general or ‘people,’ conceived either as active beings 2) If derived from car, ‘move,’ which is probable. or as cultivators 3) If derived from kr2s2, ‘plough or ‘till.’ in opposition to nomads. The expression ‘king of men’ (ra1ja1 cars2an2i1na1m) is frequently found. 4) Rv. iii. 10, 1; v. 39, 4; vi. 30, 5; viii. 70, 1; x. 139, 1, etc. The ‘people’ are also mentioned in connexion with war. 5) Rv. i. 55, 1; 109, 6; iv. 31, 4; 37, 8; vi. 31, 1, etc. In the Atharvaveda 6) xiii. 1, 38. ‘animals’ (pas4u) and ‘men’ (cars2an2i) are spoken of together. For the five cars2an2ayah2, 7) Rv. v. 86, 2; vii. 15, 2; ix. 101, 9. For the derivation, see Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 185, and especially 122, 2a (from car, ‘move’); Monier Williams, Dictionary, s.v. (from kr2s2, ‘plough’). see Pan5ca Jana1sah2.

चषाल
चषाल,
 the mortar-shaped top-piece of the sacrificial post (Yu1pa), is mentioned from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 162, 6; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 3, 4, 2, 7; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvi. 4, etc.; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 11, 8, etc. In one passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) v. 2, 1, 6. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 168, n. 1; 41, 31, n. 1. it is directed to be made of wheaten dough (gaudhu1ma).

चाक्र
चाक्र
 is the name of a man, variously styled Revottaras Sthapati Pa1t2ava Ca1kra 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. xii. 8, 1, 17. and Revottaras Pa1t2ava Ca1kra Sthapati, 2) Ibid., xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 205207; 10, 85. n. 1; Indian Literature, 123; Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 269 et seq., whose version is followed above. who is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a only. He is there said to have been expelled by the Sr2n5jayas, but to have restored to them their prince Dus2t2ari1tu despite the opposition of the Kauravya king Balhika Pra1tipi1ya. 2) Ibid., xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 205207; 10, 85, n. 1; Indian Literature, 123; Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 269 et seq., whose version is followed above. He must have been a sage rather than a warrior, as the first passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. xii. 8, 1, 17. shows him in the capacity of a teacher only. Cf. Sthapati.

चाक्रायण
चाक्रायण,
 ‘descendant of Cakra,’ is the patronymic of Us2asta or Us2asti. 1) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 5, 1; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 10, 1; 11, 1.

चाण्डाल

चाक्षुष
चाक्षुष,
 a word occurring once only in the Atharvaveda, 1) xvi. 7, 7. is, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a patronymic (of Suya1man, a personification). Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 800. treats it as probably a simple adjective (‘of sight’). 

चातुर्मास्य
चातुर्-मास्य,
 ‘four-monthly,’ denotes the festival of the Vedic ritual held at the beginning of the three seasons of four months each, into which the Vedic year was artificially divided. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 5, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 9, 5; ii. 2, 2, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 36; ii. 5, 2, 48; 6, 4, 1; v. 2, 3, 10; xiii. 2, 5, 2; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 1, etc. It is clear that the sacrifices commenced with the beginning of each season, 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 36 (cf. xiv. 1, 1, 28); Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 1. and it is certain that the first of them, the Vais4vadeva, coincided with the Pha1lguni1 full moon, 3) In the month Pha1lguna, or February-March. the second, the Varun2a-pragha1sas, with the A1s2a1d2hi1 full moon, 4) In the month A1s2a1d2ha1, or JuneJuly. and the third, the Sa1ka-medha, with the Ka1rttiki1 full moon. 5) That is, in the month Ka1rttika, when the moon is in the asterism Kr2ttika1: S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 3, 13; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 1, etc. There were, however, two alternative datings: the festivals could also be held in the Caitri1, the S4ra1van2i1, and A1graha1yan2i1 (Ma1rgas4i1rs2i1) full moons, 6) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 13, 1; 14, 1. 2; 15, 1. These are the fullmoon days in the months Caitra (March-April), S4ra1van2a (July-August), and Ma1rgas4i1r2s2a (November-December) respectively. or in the Vais4a1khi1, Bha1drapadi1, and Paus2i1 full moons. 7) Deva's Paddhati on Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, pp. 430, 450, 497. These are the full-moon days in the months Vais4a1kha (April-May), Bha1drapada (August-September), and Paus2a (December-January) respectively. Neither of the later datings is found in a Bra1hman2a text, but each may well have been known early, since the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 8) vii. 4, 8, 1. 2. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 9) v. 9, 8. 11. both recognize the full moon in the month Caitra as an alternative to the full moon in the month Pha1lguna, for the beginning of the year. Jacobi considers that the commencement of the year with the full moon in the asterism Phalguni1, which is supported by other evidence, 10) Indian Antiquary, 23, 156 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 223 et seq.; 50, 72-81. indicates that the year at one time began with the winter solstice with the moon in Phalguni1, corresponding to the summer solstice when the sun was in Phalguni1. These astronomical conditions, he believes, existed in the time of the Rigveda, 11) vii. 103, 9; x. 85, 13. Cf. Festgruss an Rudolf von Roth, 68 et seq. and prevailed in the fourth millennium B.C. The alternative dates would then indicate periods when the winter solstice coincided with the Caitri1 or the Vais4a1khi1 full moon. But Oldenberg 12) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 630 et seq.; 49, 475, 476; 50, 453-457. and Thibaut 13) Indian Antiquary, 24, 86 et seq. seem clearly right in holding that the coincidence of Pha1lguni1 with the beginning of spring, 14) See Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 6, 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 1, 2-4. So the Pha1lguni1 full moon is called ‘the mouth of the seasons (r2tu1na1m2 mukham)--e.g., Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxi. 15, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 9; and the first season is always spring: S4atapat2ha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 3, 8-14; ii. 1, 3, 1; vii. 2, 4, 26; xi. 2, 7, 32; xii. 8, 2, 34; xiii. 5, 4, 28; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 2, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 1. 7, etc. See Weber, Naxatra, 2, 352. which is certain, is fatal to this view, and that there is no difficulty in regarding this date as consistent with the date of the winter solstice in the new moon of Ma1gha, which is given by the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, 15) xix. 3. and which forms the basis of the calculations of the Jyotis2a. 16) Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie, und Mathematik, 17, 18. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 329 et seq.; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxvi., lxxxvii.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1101-1104. The full moon in Pha1lguna would be placed about one month and a half after the winter solstice, or, say, in the first week of February, which date, according to Thibaut, may reasonably be deemed to mark the beginning of a new season in India about 800 B.C. At the same time it must be remembered that the date was necessarily artificial, inasmuch as the year was divided into three seasons, each of four months, and the Indian year does not in fact consist of three equal seasons. The variations of the other datings would then not be unnatural if any school wished to defer its spring festival, the Vais4vadeva, to the time when spring had really manifested itself.

चाष
चाष,
 the ‘blue woodpecker’ (Coracias indica), is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) x. 97, 13. as well as in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 4; 15, 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 23; xxv. 7.

चिच्चिक
चिच्चिक
 is a bird mentioned with the equally unknown Vr2s2a1rava in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) x. 146, 2.

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 589.

चित्र
चित्र
 is the name of several persons. (a) The Rigveda 1) viii. 21, 18. contains a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) of a prince Citra. The later legend 2) Br2haddevata1, vii. 58 et. seq., with Macdonell's notes. attributes this panegyric to Sobhari, and describes Citra as king of the rats. (b) Citra Ga1n3gya1yani or Ga1rgya1yam2 is mentioned in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 1) i. 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 395; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 16, n. 1. as a contemporary of A1run2i and S4vetaketu. (c) Citra Gaus4ra1yan2i is mentioned as a teacher in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a. 1) xxiii. 5. Cf. Weber, loc. cit.

चित्ररथ
चित्र-रथ
 (‘having a brilliant car’) is the name of two persons. (a) It designates an A1ryan prince, who, with Arn2a, was defeated by Indra for the Turvas4a-Yadus on the Sarayu (perhaps the modern Sarju in Oudh), according to the Rigveda (iv. 30, 18). The locality would accord with the close connexion of Turvas4a and Krivi or Pan5ca1la. (b) Citraratha is also the name of a king for whom the Ka1peyas performed a special kind of sacrifice (dvira1tra), with the result, according to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xx. 12, 5. Cf. Hopkins. Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 52, 53; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 32; Indian Literature, 68, n. that in the Caitrarathi family only one member was a Ks2atra-pati, the rest dependents. Apparently this must mean that the Caitrarathis were distinguished from other families of princes by the fact that the chief of the clan received a markedly higher position than in most cases, in which probably the heads of the family were rather an oligarchy than a monarch and his dependents. See Ra1jan.

चीपुद्रु
चीपुद्रु
 designates some substance mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 127, 2. as of use in healing. The commentator Sa1yan2a reads Ci1padru, and explains the word as a kind of tree. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the Kaus4ika Su1tra 2) xxvi. 34. refers to the employment of splinters of Pala1s4a wood in the ritual application of this hymn. 3) Av. vi. 127. Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 350-352; Atharvaveda, 62; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 386. The text of Roth and Whitney reads by error S4i1pudru. suggests that the form of the word should be Ci1pud2u.

चुमुरि
चुमुरि
 is the name of an enemy of Dabhi1ti, for whom he, along with his friend Dhuni, is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 13; x. 113, 9. In vi. 26, 6, Cumuri alone is mentioned, and Da1sas or Dasyus generally are stated to have been subdued for Dabhi1ti in iv. 30, 21; ii. 13, 9. See also ii. 15, 9; vii. 19, 4. as having been defeated by Indra. Elsewhere 2) Rv. vi. 18, 8. the two are spoken of, along with S4ambara, Pipru, and S4us2n2a, as having been crushed by Indra, who destroyed their castles. It is impossible to say whether real men or demons are meant, but in favour of a man being denoted by Cumuri is the form of the name, which seems not to be A1ryan. 3) Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xxii. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 275; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology p. 162.

चूडभागवित्ति
चूड भागवित्ति
 (‘descendant of Bhagavitta’) is mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upan2is2ad 1) vi. 3, 9 (Ka1n2va=vi. 3, 17. 18 Ma1dhyam2dina). The text of the Ka1n2va has, as usual, Cu1la. as a pupil of Madhuka Pain3gya.

चूर्ण
चूर्ण
 appears to denote an aromatic powder in the phrase cu1rn2a-hasta, used of the Apsarases in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad (i. 4).

चेदि
चेदि
 is the name of a people who, with their king Kas4u, the Caidya, are mentioned only in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’), occurring at the end of one hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 5, 37-39. where their generosity is celebrated as unsurpassed. They occur later in the Epic with the Matsyas, and lived in Bandela Khan2d2a (Bundelkhand). 2) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 12, 688, n. 3; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 129; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 332; Oldenberg, Buddha, 402. In Vedic times they were probably situated in much the same locality.

चेलकशाण्डिल्यायन

चैकितानेय
चैकितानेय
 (‘descendant of Cekita1na’) is mentioned as a teacher in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 1) i. 37, 7; ii. 5, 2. The Caikita1neyas are also referred to there 2) i. 42, 1. in connexion with the Sa1man which they worshipped. Brahmadatta Caikita1neya is brought into connexion with the Sa1man in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 3) i. 3, 24. and Va1sis2t2ha Caikita1neya is known to the S2ad2vim2s4a 4) iv. 1. and Vam2s4a Bra1hman2as. 5) Indische Studien, 4, 373, 384. The word is a patronymic, formed from Caikita1na, according to S4an3kara, 6) On {|Br2hada1ran2yaka|} Upanis2ad, loc. cit. but more probably from Cekita1na, 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. a name found in the Epic.

च्यवतानमारुताश्व
च्यवतान मारुताश्व
 (‘descendant of Maruta1s4va’) is apparently the name of a prince in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’), in the Rigveda. 1) v. 33, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3. 155. Two distinct persons may, however, be meant.

च्यवन
च्यवन,
 1) This form is found even in the Nirukta (iv. 19), regularly in all the Vedic texts other than the Rigveda, and in the Epic. Cyava1na, 2) The Rv. has this form throughout. are variant forms of the name of an ancient R2s2i, or seer. The Rigveda 3) i. 116, 10; 117, 13; 118, 6; v. 74, 5; vii. 68, 6; 71, 5; x. 39, 4. represents him as an old decrepit man, to whom the As4vins restored youth and strength, making him acceptable to his wife, and a husband of maidens. The legend is given in another form in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 4) iv. 1, 5, 1 et seq. where Cyavana is described as wedding Sukanya1, the daughter of S4arya1ta. He is there called a Bhr2gu or A1n3girasa, and is represented as having been rejuvenated by immersion in a pond--the first occurrence of a motive, later very common in Oriental literature. Another legend about Cyava1na is apparently alluded to in an obscure hymn of the Rigveda, 5) x. 61, 1-3. where he seems to be opposed to the Paktha prince Tu1rvaya1n2a, an Indra worshipper, while Cyava1na seems to have been specially connected with the As4vins. This explanation of the hymn, suggested by Pischel, 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 71-77; accepted by Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 465. is corroborated by the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, 7) iii. 121-128; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxlvi; 26, 43 et seq. which relates that Vidanvant, another son of Bhr2gu, supported Cyavana against Indra, who was angry with him for sacrificing to the As4vins; it is also noteworthy that the As4vins appear in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 8) iv. 1, 5, 13 et seq. as obtaining a share in the sacrifice on the suggestion of Sukanya1. But a reconciliation of Indra and Cyavana must have taken place, because the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 9) viii. 21, 4; Pischel, op. cit., 1, 75. relates the inauguration of S4a1rya1ta by Cyavana with the great Indra consecration (aindren2a maha1bhis2eken2a). In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a1 10) xiii. 5, 12; xix. 3, 6; xiv. 6, 10; xi. 8, 11. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 243, 250-254; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 51, 52; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 43 et seq.; Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 56, 57. Cyavana is mentioned as a seer of Sa1mans or Chants. CH.

Weber 3) Indische Studien, 17, 208. thinks that in one passage of the Atharvaveda 4) iii. 7, 3. the word designates a constellation, and Whitney, 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 95. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 336. who does not decide whether that interpretation is necessary, suggests that the constellation  Aquarii may be meant, sicne the next verse mentions Vicr2tau, which is the constellation  and  Scorpionis, and is not far from Aquarius. See also Chardis.

1. Chandas in the Rigveda usually denotes a ‘song of praise’ or ‘hymn.’ 1) Rv. x. 85, 8 (an obscure verse); 114, 5; Av. iv. 34, 1; v. 26, 5; vi. 124, 1; xi. 7, 8, etc. The original sense of the word, as derived from the verb chand, ‘to please,’ was probably ‘attractive spell,’ ‘magic hymn,’ 2) Cf. Roth in St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. which prevailed on the gods. In a very late hymn of the Rigveda, 3) Rv. x. 90, 9. as well as in one of the Atharvaveda, 4) Av. xi. 7, 24. the word is mentioned in the plural (chanda1m2si), beside R2c (r2cah2), Sa1man (sa1ma1ni), and Yajus, and seems to retain its original meaning, not improbably with reference to the magical subject-matter of the Atharvaveda. From denoting a (metrical) hymn it comes to mean ‘metre’ in a very late verse of the Rigveda, 5) x. 14, 16. in which the ‘Ga1yatri1, the Tris2t2ubh, and all (sarva1) the metres (chanda1m2si) are mentioned. In the later Sam2hita1s three 6) Av. xviii. 1, 17; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 27, etc. or seven 7) Av. viii. 9, 17. 19, etc. metres are enumerated, and in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 8) viii. 3, 3, 6, etc. eight. By the time of the Rigveda Pra1tis4a1khya 9) xvi. 1 et seq. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, xcv. et seq. the metres were subjected to a detailed examination, though much earlier references are found to the number of syllables in the several metres. 10) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiv. 4; Jaittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 2, 7.

Chandas occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 12, 3. in the adjectival compound br2hac-chandas, which is used of a house, and must mean ‘having a large roof.’ Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 345; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 150. accepts the reading as correct, but Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 105. considers emendation to Chadis necessary.

छन्दोग
छन्दो-ग,
 ‘metre-singing,’ is the term applied to reciters of the Sa1mans, no doubt because these chants were sung according to their order in the Chandaa1rcika of the Sa1maveda. It is only found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) x. 5, 2, 10. and often in the Su1tras. 2) Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 2; xxii. 4; S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, x. 8, 33; xiii. 1, etc. Cf. Oldenberg, Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1908, 720.

 occurs often in the Rigveda, 1) i. 48, 15; 114, 5; vi. 15, 3; 46, 9. 12, etc. and occasionally later, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 9, 2; 3, 6, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 19; xiv. 12. denoting a secure dwelling-place. The word appears to be incorrectly written, because the metre shows that the first syllable is always short. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 477. accordingly suggested that Chadis should be read instead. But Chadis means ‘roof,’ while Chardis never has that sense. Bartholomae 4) Studien, 1, 47; 2, 58. Cf. Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xii., n. 2; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 312. is therefore probably right in suggesting some other form, such as Chad2is.

छाग
छाग,
 ‘goat,’ is found in the Rigveda, 1) i. 162, 3. and not rarely later. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 89; xxi. 40. 41; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 3, 4; v. 1, 3, 14; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 2. See Aja and Chaga. J.

जगत्
जगत्,
 ‘moving,’ is applied sometimes in the Atharvaveda, and later to the domestic animals in particular, as opposed to wild animals (s4vapad). 1) Av. viii. 5, 11, etc. Occasionally the cow is mentioned separately, when the word jagat covers the rest of the domesticated animals. 2) Av. i. 31, 4; x. 1, 29; xix. 47, 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 59. In the Rv. the sense of animal in general is usually sufficient; but cf. jagati1 in i. 157, 5; vi. 72, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 150, n.

जङ्गिड
जङ्गिड
 is the name of a healing plant mentioned in the hymns of the Atharvaveda. 1) ii. 4; xix. 34. 35. It was used as an amulet against the diseases, or symptoms of disease, Takman, Bala1sa, A1s4ari1ka, Vis4ari1ka, Pr2s2t2ya1maya, 2) Av. xix. 34, 10. fevers and rheumatic pains, Vis2kandha and Sam2skandha, 3) Av. ii. 4, 1; xix. 34, 1. 5. Jambha, and so on. But it is also regarded as a specific against all diseases, and as the best of healing powers. 4) Av. xix. 34, 9. 7. It is said to be produced from the juices (rasa) of ploughing (kr2s2i), 5) Av. ii. 4, 5. but this need only mean that it grew in cultivated land, not that it was itself cultivated. What plant the name designates is quite uncertain, for it disappears in the later literature. Caland 6) Altindisches Zauberritual, 15, rendering Kaus4ika Su1tra, viii. 15. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 433; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 42; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 141; Grohmann, ibid., 9, 417; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 65, 66, 390. takes it in the Kaus4ika Su1tra to be the Terminalia arjuneya.

जतू
जतू,
 the ‘bat,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 2, 22. and is mentioned as one of the victims at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 25. 26. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. 

जन
जन,
 besides meaning ‘man’ as an individual, with a tendency to the collective sense, commonly denotes a ‘people’ or ‘tribe’ in the Rigveda and later. Thus, the ‘five tribes’ (Panca Jana1h2 or Jana1sah2) are frequently referred to, and in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 6, 46. 48. the ‘people of Yadu’ (ya1dva jana) and the Yadus (ya1dva1h2) are synonymous. Again, the king (ra1jan) is described as ‘protector (gopa1) of the people (janasya),’ 2) Rv. iii. 43, 5. So Soma is called gopati janasya, ‘protector of the people,’ Rv. ix. 35, 5. and there are other references to king and Jana. 3) Rv. v. 58, 4. The people of the Bharatas (bha1rata jana) is also mentioned; 4) Rv. iii. 53, 12. See also Bharata. Cf. also x. 174, 5 = Av. i. 29, 6. there is no ground to assume with Hopkins 5) Religions of India, 26, 27. It is true that the Bharatas are called a gavyan gra1mah2, ‘a horde eager for booty,’ in Rv. iii. 33, 11; but Gra1ma has there merely a general application. Seen. 10. that Jana in this case means a clan or horde (Gra1ma), as distinguished from a people. It is difficult to say exactly how a people was divided. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 159, 160. argues from a passage in the Rigveda 7) ii. 26, 3. that a people was divided into cantons (Vis4), cantons into joint families or clans, or village communities (Gra1ma, Vr2jana), and these again into single families. He thinks that the four divisions are reflected in the passage in question. by Jana, Vis4, Janman, and Putra1h2, or sons, and argues that each village community was originally founded on relationship. But it is very doubtful whether this precise division of the people can be pressed. The division of the Jana into several Vis4 may be regarded as probable, for it is supported by the evidence of another passage of the Rigveda, 8) x. 84, 4. Vis4ah2 may have the same sense in several other passages--iv. 24, 4; v. 61, 1; vi. 26, 1; vii. 79, 2; viii. 12, 29--but it need not necessarily bear this sense. But in x. 91, 2, there is a clear contrast between Vis4 and Jana. which mentions the Vis4 as a unit of the fighting men, and thus shows that, as in Homeric times and in ancient Germany, relationship was deemed a good principle of military arrangement. But the subdivision of the Vis4 into several Gra1mas is very doubtful. Zimmer 9) Op. cit., 161. He also relies on Rv. v. 53, 11, where the Maruts are divided into s4ardha, vra1ta, and gan2a; but these words are vague. admits that neither Gra1ma 10) Rv. iii. 33. 11. See n. 5. nor Vr2jana 11) Rv. vii. 32, 27; x. 42, 10. has the special sense of a subdivision of the Vis4 when used for war, for both words only denote generally an armed host. He finds other designations of the village host in Vra1 12) Rv. i. 126, 5 (vis4ya1 iva vra1h2). and in Vra1ja, 13) Rv. x. 179, 2=Av. vii. 72, 2. but it is sufficient to say that the former passage is of extremely doubtful import, 14) Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 121, 319. and that the latter has no reference to war at all. It is therefore impossible to state in what exact relation the Gra1ma in Vedic times stood to the Vis4 or to the family (Kula or Gotra). The confusion is increased by the vagueness of the sense of both Gra1ma and Vis4. If the latter be regarded as a local division, then no doubt the Gra1ma must have been a part of a district; but if a Vis4 was a unit of relationship, then a Gra1ma may have contained families of different Vis4es, or may have sometimes coincided with a Vis4, or have contained only a part of a Vis4. But in any case the original state of affairs must have been greatly modified by the rise of the system of caste, and the substitution of a hierarchical for a political point of view. The elements of the people were represented by the family--either as an individual family inhabiting one home (Kula), and consisting often, no doubt, of a joint family of brothers, or as a patriarchal family of sons who still lived with their father--and by the clan, the later Gotra, which included all those who claimed a common ancestor. The Gotra may be regarded as roughly corresponding to the Latin gens and the Greek , and possibly the Vis4 may be the equivalent of the curia and , and the Jana of the tribus and  or . 15) Cf. Iliad, 2, 362. These three divisions may also be seen in the Vis4, Zantu, and Daqyu of the Iranian world, where the use of Vis4 suggests that in the Indian Vis4 a relationship based on blood rather than locality is meant--and perhaps even in the vicus, pagus, and civitas of the old German polity described in the Germania 16) Chap. vii. Zimmer gives other equations, for which cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 393 et seq. The exact parallelism cannot in any case be pressed. of Tacitus. The family in some form appears as the third element of the Jana in a passage of the Rigveda, 17) x. 91, 2, where janam2 janam and vis4am2 vis4am occur, and where a contrast must be meant. where the house (gr2ha) is contrasted with the Jana and the Vis4. Possibly, too, another passage 18) Rv. vii. 82, 1. contrasts the adhvara, or family sacrifice, with that of the Jana or Vis4, rather than, as Zimmer 19) Altindisches Leben, 435. thinks, the village with the two larger units. But it is significant of the particularism of the Vedic Indians that while the king maintained a fire which might be regarded as the sacred fire of the tribe, there is no sure trace 20) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 126. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 158; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 32, 33; Jolly, Zeitschrift der Dcutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 50, 512 et seq. of any intermediate cult between that of the king and that of the individual householder. The real elements in the state are the Gotra and the Jana, just as ultimately the gens and tribus, the  and  are alone important. It may be that Vis4 sometimes represents in the older texts what later was known as the Gotra. See Vis4. This appears clearly when the constitution of society in the Bra1hman2a period is considered. The tribe or people still exists, and is presupposed, but the division into Vis4 disappears. The real division is now the separate castes (Varn2a), but the numerous sections into which each of them is divided appear to be based in part on the ancient Gotra.

2. Jana S4a1rkaraks2ya (‘descendant of S4arkaraks2a’) is mentioned as a teacher in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (x. 6, 1, 1 et seq.) and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (v. 11, 1; 15, 1). He was a contemporary of As4vapati Kaikeya, and of Arun2a Aupaves4i and his son Udda1laka A1run2i.

जनक
जनक,
 king of Videha, plays a considerable part in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xi. 3, 1, 2; 4, 3, 20; 6, 2, 1 et seq. and the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 2) iii. 1, 1; iv. 1, 1; 2, 1; 4, 7; v. 14, 8. as well as in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a 3) i. 19, 2 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 329); ii. 76 (ibid., 15, 238). and the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad. 4) iv. 1. He was a contemporary of Ya1jn5avalkya Va1ja saneya, 5) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 1, 2; 4, 3, 20; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, loc. cit.; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. of S4vetaketu A1run2eya, and of other sages. 6) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 2, 1 et seq. He had become famous for his generosity and his interest in the discussion of the nature of Brahman, as ultimate basis of reality, in the life-time of Aja1tas4atru of Ka1s4i. 7) Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, loc. cit.; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 1. It is significant that he maintained a close intercourse with the Brahmins of the Kuru-Pan5ca1las, such as Ya1jn5avalkya and S4vetaketu; for this indicates that the home of the philosophy of the Upanis2ads was in the Kuru-Pan5ca1la country rather than in the east. There is a statement in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 8) xi. 6, 2, 10. that he became a Brahmin (brahma1). This does not, however, signify a change of caste, but merely that in knowledge he became a Brahmin (see Ks2atriya). Janaka is occasionally mentioned in later texts: in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 9) iii. 10, 9, 9. he has already become quite mythical; in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 10) xvi. 26, 7. a sapta-ra1tra or seven nights' rite is ascribed to him. It is natural to attempt to date Janaka by his being a contemporary of Aja1tas4atru, and by identifying the latter with the Aja1tasattu of the Pa1li texts: 11) Vincent Smith, Early History of India, 26 et seq. this would make the end of the sixth century B.C. the approximate date of Janaka. 12) Hoernle, Osteology, 106. But it is very doubtful whether this identification can be supported: Aja1tas4atru was king of Ka1s4i, whereas Aja1tasattu was king of Magadha, and his only connexion with Ka1s4i was through his marriage with the daughter of Pasenadi of Kosala. 13) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 3 et seq. Moreover, the acceptance of this chronology would be difficult to reconcile with the history of the development of thought; for it would make the rise of Buddhism contemporaneous with the Upanis2ads, whereas it is reasonably certain that the older Upanis2ads preceded Buddhism. 14) See e.g., von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur and Cultur, 243; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 224; Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanis2ads, 23 et seq.; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 25, 29. Nor do the Vedic texts know anything of Bimbisa1ra or Pasenadi, or any of the other princes famed in Buddhist records. The identification 15) Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 135; Von Schroeder, op. cit., 189; Macdonell, op. cit., 214. of Janaka of Videha and the father of Si1ta1 is less open to objection, but it cannot be proved, and is somewhat doubtful. In the Su1tras Janaka appears as an ancient king who knew of a time when wifely honour was less respected than later. 16) Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 48. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 426 et seq.; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 421 et seq.; Von Schroeder, op. cit., 187-189; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 175, 231; Oldenberg, Buddha, 31, n., who properly emphasizes the difficulty of attaching much importance to the names of the leaders of the thought of the Upanis2ads.

जनता
जनता,
 a word frequently found in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 1, 4; 6, 4; 3, 4, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 17; Av. v. 18, 12, etc. and the Bra1hman2as, 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 6, 1; ii. 3, 1, 3; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 7. 9; iii. 31; v. 9, etc. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 153, n. denotes the people as a community (cf. Sabha1) or as a religious unit.

जनपद
जन-पद
 in the Bra1hman2as denotes both the ‘people,’ as opposed to the king, 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 14 (plural); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 2, 17. and the ‘land’ or ‘relam.’ 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 9, 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 20; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 11, 5; viii. 1, 5. The ‘subjects’ are also denoted by the adjectival ja1napada. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 5, 1, 20.

जनमेजय
1. Janam-ejaya (‘man-impelling’) is the name of a king, a Pa1riks2ita, 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 1 et seq.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 34; viii. 11. 21; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 8, 27, etc. famous towards the end of the Bra1hman2a period. He is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xi. 5, 5, 13. as owning horses which when wearied were refreshed with sweet drinks, and as a performer of the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice. 3) xiii. 5, 4, 1-3. His capital, according to a Ga1tha1 quoted in the S4atapatha 4) xiii. 5, 4, 2. and the Aitareya Bra1hman2as, 5) viii. 21. was A1sandi1vant. His brothers Ugrasena, Bhi1masena, and S4rutasena are mentioned as having by the horse sacrifice purified themselves from sin. The priest who performed the sacrifice for him was Indrota Daiva1pi S4aunaka. 6) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 1; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, loe. cit. On the other hand the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 7) viii. 21. Cf. iv. 27; vii. 34. which also mentions his As4vamedha, names Tura Ka1vas2eya as his priest. It also contains an obscure tale stating that at one sacrifice of his he did not employ the Kas4yapas, but the Bhu1tavi1ras, being, however, induced by the Asitamr2gas to have recourse to the Kas4yapas again. 8) vii. 27. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 204; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 438, n. 229; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 345, n. He was a Kuru prince; see Pariks2it. The Gopatha Bra1hman2a 9)i. 2, 5. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 123125; 134-136; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 37, 65 et seq.; 42, 239; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 28 et seq. tells an absurd tale about him, evidently as of an ancient hero.

जनमेजय
2. Janam-ejaya is in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35. the name of a priest who officiated at the snake sacrifice.

जनश्रुत
जन-श्रुत
 (‘famed among men’) Ka1n2d2viya is the name of a pupil of Hr2tsva1s4aya, mentioned in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 40, 2), and of Va1rakya, a pupil of Jayanta, referred to in the same Bra1hman2a (iii. 41, 1; iv. 17, 1). Cf. Ja1nas4ruti.

जनि
जनि, जनी
 --These words appear to denote ‘wife,’ usually applying to her in relation to her husband (Pati). The more general sense of ‘woman’ is doubtful; for when Us2as is called a fair Jani1, 1) Rv. iv. 52, 1. ‘wife’ may be meant, and the other passage 2) v. 61, 3. cited for this sense by Delbru7ck, 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandschaftsnamen, 413. which refers to the begetting of childern, seems to demand the sense of ‘wives.’ Since the words usually appear in the plural, 4) i. 85, 1; iv. 5, 5; 19, 5; vii. 18, 2; 26, 3; ix. 86, 32; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 35; xx. 40. 43, etc. Cf. Rv. x. 43, 1. In x. 110, 5, the phrase is patibhyo na janayah2, where both plurals may be generic it is possible they may refer not to ‘wives’ proper, but to Hetairai. This is, however, rendered unlikely because the Rigveda 5) x. 18, 8. Cf. janitvana in viii. 2, 42. uses the phrase patyur janitvam, denoting ‘wifehood to a husband,’ as well as the expression janayo na patni1h2, 6) i. 62, 10; 186, 7. ‘like wives (who are) mistresses,’ 7) The distinction of sense was probably this: jani meant ‘wife,’ as bearing children (from jan, ‘beget’), while patni1 was ‘wife,’ as being mistress of the house (feminine of pati, ‘lord,’ ‘husband’). besides containing passages in which the word has reference to marriage. 8) v. 61, 3. So in x. 40, 10, the word seems certainly to refer to marriage. The singular occurs in the dialogue of Yama and Yami1. 9) x. 10, 3.

जनितृ

 1) Rv. i. 129, 11; 164, 33; iii. 1, 10; 54, 9, etc.; Av. iv. 1, 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 87, etc. and Janitri1 2) Rv. iii. 48, 2; 54, 14; Av. vi. 110, 13; ix. 5, 30, etc. are frequent words, in the Rigveda and later, for ‘father’ and ‘mother’ regarded as the ‘begetter’ and the ‘bearer’ respectively of the child. See Pitr2, Ma1tr2.

जन्तु
जन्तु,
 besides the general sense of ‘man,’ has also in a few passages 1) Rv. 1. 94, 5; x. 140, 4. the more restricted sense of ‘follower’ or ‘subject.’ The ‘followers of S4vaitreya’ 2) Rv. v. 19, 3. may be compared with the ‘subjects (vis4ah2) of Tr2n2askanda.’ 3) Rv. i. 172, 3.

जन्मन्
जन्मन्
 appears to have the sense of ‘relations’ in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) iii. 15, 2; ii. 26, 3 (where janena, vis4a1, janmana1, putraih2, is the series). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 160, and see Jana and Vis4. being used collectively in the second of them.

जमदग्नि
जमद्-अग्नि
 is one of the somewhat mythical sages of the Rigveda, where he is frequently mentioned. In some passages 1) Rv. iii. 62, 18; viii. 101, 8; ix. 62, 24; 65, 25. his name occurs in such a way as to indicate that he is the author of the hymn; once 2) Rv. x. 167, 4. he is thus associated with Vis4va1mitra. In other passages 3) Rv. vii. 96, 3; ix. 97, 51. he is merely referred to, and the Jamadagnis are mentioned once. 4) Rv. iii. 53, 15. 16. In the Atharvaveda, 5) ii. 32, 3 (cf. Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iv. 36; Mantra Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 1); iv. 29, 3; v. 28, 7; vi. 137, 1; xviii. 3, 15. 16. as well as the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 12, 4; iii. 1, 7, 3; 3, 5, 2; v. 2, 10, 5; 4, 11, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 19; iv. 2, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 19; xx. 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 62; xiii. 56. and the Bra1hman2as, 7) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 4, 14; xiii. 5, 15; xxi. 10, 5-7; xxii. 7, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 16; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 2, 14; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 9, 7; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 2, 4; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 11; iv. 3, 1, etc. he is quite a frequent figure. Here he appears as a friend of Vis4va1mitra 8) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 7, 3; v. 4, 11, 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 15. and a rival of Vasis2t2ha. 9) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, loc. cit. He owed his prosperity to his catu1ra1tra, or ‘four-night’ ritual, with which his family were also very successful. 10) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxi. 10, 5-7. In the Atharvaveda 11) ii. 32, 3; vi. 137, 1. Jamadagni is connected with Atri and Kan2va, as well as Asita and Vitahavya. He was Adhvaryu priest at the proposed sacrifice of S4unah2s4epa. 12) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 16. Cf.

In one passage 1) ii. 4, 2. it is said to be cured by the Jan3gid2a plant; in the other 2) viii. 1, 16. it is described as samhanuh2, ‘bringing the jaws together.’ Weber 3) Indische Studien, 13, 142. argued from the Kaus4ika Su1tra 4) xxxii. 1. that it was a child's ailment, especially ‘teething.’ Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 283. considers it to mean ‘convulsions,’ while Caland 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen la7ndischen Gesellschaft, 53, 224; Altindisches Zauberritual, 103. thinks it denotes ‘tetanus.’ Whitney 7) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 42. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 392. decides for ‘lockjaw’ or ‘convulsions.’

जम्भक
जम्भक,
 as the name of a demon, presumably identical with the demon causing Jambha, is mentioned in the Va1ja saneyi Sam2hita1 1) xxx. 16. and the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka. 2) xii. 25. Cf. Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ranyaka, 67, n. 7.

जयकलौहित्य
जयक लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Yas4asvin Jayanta Lauhitya.

जयन्त
जयन्त
 is the name of several teachers in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a: (a) Jayanta Pa1ra1s4arya (‘descendant of Para1s4ara’) is mentioned as a pupil of Vipas4cit in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers). 1) iii. 41, 1. (b) Jayanta Va1rakya (‘descendant of Varaka’) appears in the same Vam2s4a 1) iii. 41, 1. as a pupil of Kubera Va1rakya. His grandtather is also mentioned there as a pupil of Kam2sa Va1rakya. (c) A Jayanta Va1rakya, pupil of Suyajn5a S4a1n2d2ilya, perhaps identical with the preceding, is found in another Vam2s4a. 2) iv. 17, 1. (d) Jayanta is a name of Yas4asvin Lauhitya. 3) iii. 42, 1. Not only is the formation of the name a late one (cf. Whitney, Sanskrit Grammar, 1209d, and Macdonell, Vedic Grammar 191a), but the Upanis2ad in which it occurs is also a late one. See also Daks2a Jayanta Lauhitya.

जराबोध
जरा-बोध,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) i. 27, 10. is of doubtful meaning. It is held by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 103. to be the name of a seer. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Nirukta, x. 8. regards it as a mere adjective meaning ‘attending to the invocation,’ which is perhaps the most probable interpretation. Oldenburg, 4) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 23. He compares the r2s2i1 bodha-pratibodhau of Av. v. 30, 10. however, thinks that the word is a proper name, the literal sense being ‘alert in old age.’

जरायु
जरायु
 is found once in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 27, 1. in the sense of a ‘serpent's skin.’ Usually 2) Rv. v. 78, 8; Av. i. 11, 4; vi. 49, 1; ix. 4, 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 6, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 8; xix. 76; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 1, 11, etc; Cha1ndogya Upanisad, iii. 10. 2, etc. it denotes the outer covering (chorion) of the embryo, as opposed to the ulva, the inner covering (amnion). Living things are occasionally classified according to their mode of origin. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 3) vi. 3, 1. they are divided into (a) a1n2d2a-ja, ‘egg-born’; (b) ji1va-ja, ‘born alive,’ or born from the womb; (c) udbhij-ja, ‘propagated by sprouts.’ In the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 4) ii. 6. the division is fourfold: (a) a1n2d2a-ja; (b) ja1ru-ja, that is, jara1yu-ja (found in the Atharvaveda, 5) i. 12, 1. and needlessly read here by Bo7htlingk); 6) See ja1ru in Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 430, 6. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 196, 292; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 235. (c) udbhij-ja; and (d) svcda-ja, ‘sweat-born,’ explained as ‘insects.’

जरितृ
1. Jaritr2 is the regular term in the Rigveda, 1) i. 2, 2; 165, 14; ii. 33, 11; iii. 60, 7, etc. and occasionally later, 2) Av. v. 11, 8; xx. 135, 1, etc. for a singer of hymns of praise or worshipper.

जरितृ
2. Jaritr2. According to Sieg, 1) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 44 et seq. mention is made in one hymn of the Rigveda 2) x. 142. of Jaritr2, one of the S4a1rn3gas. That hymn he seeks to bring into connexion with the epic 3) Maha1bha1rata, i. 222, 1 et seq. tradition of the R2s2i Mandapa1la, who wedded Jarita1, a female S4a1rn3ga bird--apparently a hen sparrow (cat2aka1)--and had four sons. These being abandoned by him and exposed to the danger of being consumed by a forest fire, prayed to Agni with the hymn Rigveda x. 142. This interpretation is very doubtful, though Sa1yan2a 4) On Rv. x. 142, 7. 8. appears to have adopted it.

जरूथ
जरूथ,
 mentioned in three passages of the Rigveda, 1) vii. 1, 7; 9, 6; x. 80. 3. appears to denote a demon defeated by Agni. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Nirukta, vi. 17. Ludwig, however, followed by Griffith, 3) Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 11, n. sees in him a foe slain in a battle in which Vasis2t2ha, the traditional author of the seventh Man2d2ala of the Rigveda, was Purohita, or domestic priest.

जर्तिल
जर्तिल,
 ‘wild sesamum,’ is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (v. 4, 3, 2) as an unsuitable sacrificial offering. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (ix. 1, 1, 3) sesamum seeds are regarded as combining the qualities of cultivation (viz., edibility) with those of wild growth (because they are produced on unploughed land).

जर्वर
जर्वर
 was Gr2hapati or ‘householder’ at the snake festival described in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

जलजातूकर्ण्य
जल जातूकर्ण्य
 (‘descendant of Ja1tu1karn2a’), is mentioned in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xvi. 29, 6) as having obtained the position of Purohita, or domestic priest, of the three peoples or kings of Ka1s4i, Videha, and Kosala.

जलाषभेषज
जलाष-भेषज,
 ‘whose remedy is Jala1s2a,’ is an epithet of Rudra in the Rigveda 1) i. 43, 4; viii. 29, 5. and the Atharvaveda. 2) ii. 27, 6. It also occurs in the Ni1larudra Upanis2ad (a very late work), 3, and jala1s2a as an adjective is found in Rv. ii. 33, 7; viii. 33, 6. The word Ja1la1s2a occurs in a hymn of the Atharvaveda, 3) vi. 57. where it denotes a remedy, perhaps, for a tumour or boil. 4) Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 321 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 489. The commentator on this passage and the Kaus4ika Su1tra 5) xxxi. 11. regard Ja1la1s2a as meaning ‘urine,’ which seems a probable interpretation. 6) Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 12, 425 et seq. But Geldner 7) Vedische Studien, 3, 139, n. 2. thinks that rain-water, conceived as urine, is meant; and the Naighan2t2uka 8) i. 12. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 323, 324; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 76, 77; Hopkins, Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, 1894, cl. identifies jala1s2a and udaka ‘water.’

जष
जष
 is the name of some aquatic animal or fish in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 2, 25. There are various readings: jhas2a, jakha, jagha. and the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 2) v. 5, 13, 1. The commentary on the latter text explains it by makara, probably meaning ‘dolphin.’ The word also occurs in the Gopatha Bra1hman2a. 3) ii. 2, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 624 Cf. Jhas2a.

जहका
जहका,
 the ‘polecat,’ is mentioned as a victim at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 18, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 17; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 36. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. Sa1yan2a 2) On Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, loc. cit. thinks it means a jackal living in holes (vila-va1si1 kros2t2a1).

जह्नु
जह्नु
 occurs only in the plural in the legend of S4unah2s4epa, who is said to have obtained, as Devara1ta, both the lordship of the Jahnus and the divine lore of the Ga1thins. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 18 (Jahnu1na1m ca1dhipatye daive vede ca Ga1thina1m); Asvala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 14; Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xv. 27 (p. 195, 1. 21, ed. Hillebrandt, where the reading is different and the sense altered: Jahnu1na1m2 ca1dhitasthire daive vede ca Ga1thinah2. The two ca's cannot be justified, and the text must be incorrect). A Ja1hnava, or descendant of Jahnu, was, according to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 2) xxi. 12. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54, who correctly explains the passage which Sa1yan2a misunderstands. Vis4va1mitra, who is said, by means of a certain catu1-ra1tra or ‘four-night’ ritual, to have secured the kingdom for the Jahnus in their conflict with the Vr2ci1vants. He is here described as a king. Again, in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 3) vii. 17, 6, 7. Vis4va1mitra is addressed as a ra1ja-putra, ‘prince,’ and Bharatars2abha, ‘bull of the Bharatas.’ It is therefore clear that the Bra1hman2as, though not the Sam2hita1s, saw in him at once a priest and a prince by origin, though there is no trace whatever of their seeing in him a prince who won Brahmanhood as in the version of the later texts. 4) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1, 337 et seq. A Jahna1vi1 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda, 5) i. 116, 19; iii. 58, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153. being either the wife of Jahnu, or, as Sa1yan2a thinks, the race of Jahnu. The family must clearly once have been a great one, later merged in the Bharatas.

जातशाकायन्य
जात शाकायन्य
 (‘descendant of S4a1ka’) is mentioned as a ritual authority and contemporary of S4an3kha in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 (xxii. 7).

जातरूप
जात-रूप,
 ‘possessing native beauty,’ is the name of ‘gold’ in the later Bra1hman2as 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 13 (ja1taru1pa-maya, ‘composed of gold’); Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 25; Naighan2t2uka, i. 2. and the Su1tras. 2) Rajata-ja1taru1pe, ‘silver and gold,’ La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 6, 24. Cf. viii. 1, 3; Kaus4ika Su1tra, x. 16; xiii. 3, etc.; Sa1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 19, 9.

जाति
जाति,
 which in the Pa1li 1) Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 22, n. 4. texts is the word denoting ‘caste,’ does not occur at all in the early Vedic literature; when it is found, as in the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 2) xv. 4, 14. So ja1ti1ya, xx. 2, 11, etc. it has only the sense of ‘family’ (for which cf. Kula, Gotra, and Vis4). For the influence of the family system on the growth of caste, see Varn2a. To assume that it was the basis of caste, as does Senart, 3) Les Castes dans l'Inde (1896). is difficult in face of the late appearance of words for family and of stress on family. 4) Fick, op. cit., 3; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 51, 267 et seq.

जातूकर्ण्य
जातू-कर्ण्य,
 ‘descendant of Ja1tu1karn2a,’ is the patronymic of several persons. (a) A pupil of A1sura1yan2a and Ya1ska bears this name in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad in the Ka1n2va recension. 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3. In the Ma1dhyam2dina 2) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27. he is a pupil of Bha1radva1ja. (b) A Ka1tya1yani1-putra, ‘son of Ka1tya1yani1,’ bears this name in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka. 3) viii. 10. (c) A Ja1tu1karn2ya is mentioned in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 4) xxvi. 5 (Ja1tukarn2ya in Lindner's index, 159, is a misprint). as a contemporary of Ali1kayu Va1caspatya and other sages. (d) Ja1tu1karn2ya is in the Su1tras 5) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 3, 3; S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, i. 2, 17; iii. 16, 14; 20, 19; xvi. 29, 6 (Jala); Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, iv. 1, 27; xx. 3, 17; xxv. 7, 34, etc. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 138140. frequently a patronymic of teachers whose identity cannot be determined. The same person or different persons may here be meant.

जातूष्ठिर
जातू-ष्ठिर
 occurs in one verse of the Rigveda 1) ii. 13, 11. where Sa1yan2a and Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152. interpret the word as a proper name. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. (with a wrong reference, ii. 23, 11). renders it as an adjective meaning ‘naturally powerful.’ 4) Urkra7ftig. Grassmann, Wo7rterbuch, similarly explains the word as ‘powerful by nature or birth’ (ja1tu1).

जान
जान,
 ‘descendant of Jana,’ is the patronymic of Vr2s4a in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 3, 12. and apparently in the S4a1t2ya1yanaka. 2) In Sa1yan2a on Rv. v. 5. Cf. Br2haddevata1, v. 14 et seq., with Macdonell's notes; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 64 et seq. 

जानक
जानक,
 ‘descendant of Janaka,’ is the patronymic of Kratuvid in some MSS. of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) vii. 34. In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 2) ii. 3, 8, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 1. the name appears instead as Kratujit Ja1naki. Ja1naka is also, according to some manuscripts of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 3) vi. 3, 10 (Ka1n2va). the patronymic of A1yasthu1n2a, but is here no doubt a misreading of Ja1naki.

जानकि
जानकि,
 ‘descendant of Janaka,’ is the patronymic of Kratujit in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 1) ii. 3, 8, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 1. of Kratuvid in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 2) vii. 34. and of A1yasthu1n2a in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 3) vi. 3, 10 (Ka1n2va = vi. 3, 18. 19, Ma1dhyam2dina). where he is mentioned as a pupil of Cu1d2a Bha1gavitti, and as teacher of Satyaka1ma Ja1ba1la.

जानश्रुति
जान-श्रुति,
 ‘descendant of Ja1nas4ruta,’ is the patronymic of Pautra1yan2a in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (iv. 1, 1; 2, 1).

जानश्रुतेय
जान-श्रुतेय,
 ‘descendant of Ja1nas4ruti’ or of ‘Janas4ruta1.’ is the patronymic or metronymic of several persons--Upa1vi 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 25, 115. or Aupa1vi, 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 1, 5. 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 5.

जाबाल
जाबाल,
 ‘descendant of Jaba1la,’ is the metronymic of Maha1s4a1la 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 3, 3, 1; 6, 1, 1. and Satyaka1ma. 2) Ibid., xiii. 5, 3, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 14; vi. 3, 19; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 4, 1, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 7. Ja1ba1la is also mentioned as a teacher in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, 3) iii. 9, 9. which refers to the Ja1ba1las 4) iii. 7, 2. as well. The Ja1ba1la Gr2hapatis are spoken of in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a. 5) xxiii. 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 395.

जाबालायन
जाबालायन,
 ‘descendant of Ja1ba1la,’ is the patronymic of a teacher, a pupil of Ma1dhyam2dina1yana, who is mentioned in the second Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Ka1n2va recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (iv. 6, 2).

जामदग्निय
जामदग्निय
 is the patronymic of two ‘descendants of Jamadagni’ in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 1) vii. 1, 9, 1. It appears from the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xxi. 10, 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 12, 251, n.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54. that the Aurvas are meant, and that Jamadagni's descendants were ever prosperous.

जामातृ
जामातृ
 is a rare word denoting ‘son-in-law’ in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 2, 20. Va1yu is called the ja1ma1tr2 of Tvas2t2r2 in viii. 26, 21. 22. Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 517; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 78, 79. where also occurs the word Vija1ma1tr2, denoting an ‘unsatisfactory son-in-law,’ as one who does not pay a sufficient price, or one who, having other defects, must purchase a bride. Friendly relations between son-in-law and father-in-law are referred to in the Rigveda. 2) x. 28, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 255.

जामि
जामि,
 a word which appears originally to have meant ‘related in blood,’ is not rarely used as an epithet of ‘sister’ (Svasr2), and sometimes even denotes ‘sister’ itself, the emphasis being on the blood-relationship. 1) Cf. Delbru7ck, Dic indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 463, 464. As ‘relation,’ it occurs, e.g., Rv. i. 31, 10; 75, 3. 4; 100, 11; 124, 6, etc.; as ‘sister,’ Rv. i. 65, 7; x. 10, 10, etc.; with svasa1, i. 123, 5; 185, 5; iii. 1, 11; ix. 65, 1; 89, 4, etc. So it appears in a passage of the Atharvaveda, 2) i. 17, 1. where ‘brotherless sisters’ (abhra1tara iva ja1mayah2) are referred to. The word is similarly used in the dispute occurring in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 3) iii. 37. as to the precedence of Ra1ka1, or of the wives of the gods, in a certain rite. One party is there described as holding that the sister should be preferred (ja1myai vai pu1rva-peyam)--apparently at a ceremonial family meal--to the wife, presumably as being of one blood with the husband, while the wife is not (being anyodarya1, ‘of another womb’). 4) Delbru7ck, loc. cit. In the neuter 5) Rv. iii. 54, 9; x. 10, 4; ja1mi-kr2t, ‘making relationship,’ Av. iv. 19, 1. Cf. Altareya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. the word means ‘relationship,’ like ja1mi-tva, which also occurs in the Rigveda. 6) i. 105, 9; 166, 13; x. 55, 4; 64, 13.

जामिशंस
जामि-शंस,
 the ‘imprecation by a sister’ or ‘relation,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 10, 1 (= Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 6, 3), and personified in ix. 4, 15. Cf. ja1mya1h2 s4apathah2, Av. ii. 7, 2; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 362. showing that family disputes were not rare. This is also indicated by the word Bhra1tr2vya, which, while properly meaning ‘father's brother's son,’ regularly denotes simply ‘enemy.’

जाम्बिल
जाम्बिल,
 ‘hollow of the knee,’ 1) Perhaps for ja1nu-bila. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 11, n. 4. occurs once in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 2) iii. 15, 3. The word also occurs in the form of Ja1mbi1la in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 3) v. 13, 1. and the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 4) xxv. 3. Mahi1dhara, in his commentary on the latter text, interprets the word as ‘knee-pan,’ which he says is so named because of its resemblance to the citron, ja1mbi1ra.

जायन्तीपुत्र
जायन्ती-पुत्र,
 ‘son of Ja1yanti1,’ is mentioned in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) vi. 5, 2 (Ka1n2va = vi. 4, 32 Ma1dhyam2dina). as a pupil of Ma1n2d2u1ka1yani1putra.

जाया
जाया
 regularly denotes ‘wife,’ and, as opposed to Patni1, wife as an object of marital affection, the source of the continuance of the race. 1) Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 411, 412. Cf. Rv. i. 105, 2; 124, 7; iii. 53, 4; iv. 3, 2; 18, 3; ix. 82, 4; x. 10, 7; 17, 1; 71, 4, etc.; Av. iii. 30, 2; vi. 60, 1, etc. So it is used of the wife of the gambler, and of the wife of the Bra1hman2a in the Rigveda; 2) x. 34, 2. 3. 13, and x. 109. it is also frequently combined with Pati, ‘husband,’ 3) Rv. iv. 3, 2; x. 149, 4. both there and in the later literature. 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 23, 1. Cf. vii. 13, 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 6, 7, 9. Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 12. Patni1, on the other hand, is used to denote the wife as partner in the sacrifice; 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 9, 2, 14. when no share in it is assigned to her, she is called Ja1ya1. 6) i. 1, 4, 13. The distinction is, of course, merely relative; hence one text 7) Ibid., i. 1, 4, 16. calls Manu's wife Ja1ya1, another 8) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 8, 1. Patni1. Later on Ja1ya1 is superseded by Da1ra.

जायान्य
जायान्य,
 1) Av. vii. 76, 3-5; xix. 44, 2. Ja1yenya, 2) ii. 3, 5, 2; 5, 6, 5. are variant forms of the name of a disease mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. In one passage of the former text 3) xix. 44, 2. it is mentioned with jaundice (harima1) and pains in the limbs (an3ga-bhedo visalpakah2). Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 377, following Wise, Hindu System of Medicint, 321, describing Aks2ata. thinks these are its symptoms, and identifies it with a kind of Yaks2ma, or disease of the lungs. Bloomfield 5) American Journal of Philology, 11, 320 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 559-561. prefers to identify it with syphilis, in accordance with certain indications in the ritual of the Kaus4ika Su1tra. 6) xxxii. 11. Cf. also the commentary on Av. vii. 76, and Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, loc. cit. Roth conjectures ‘gout,’ but Whitney 7) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 442. Cf. Henry, Lelivre vii de l' Atharvave4da, 98. leaves the nature of the disease doubtful.

 ‘lover,’ has no sinister sense in the early texts 1) Rv. i. 66, 8; 117, 18; 134, 3; 152, 4; ix. 32, 5, etc. The word is often used mythologically, as, e.g., ja1ra us2asa1m, ‘lover of the dawns,’ vii. 9, 1. Cf Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 308. generally, where the word applies to any lover. But it seems probable that the Ja1ra at the Purus2amedha, or human sacrifice, 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 4. 1. must be regarded as an illegitimate lover; this sense also appears in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 3) vi. 4, 11. and Indra is styled the lover of Ahalya1, wife of Gautama 4) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 65.

जारत्कारव

जास्पति
जास्-पति
 occurs once in the Rigveda 1) i. 135. 8. in the sense of the ‘head of the family.’ The abstract formed from this word, Ja1s-patya, apparently denoting ‘lordship of children,’ is also found there. 2) Rv. v. 28, 3; x. 85, 23.

जाह्नव
जाह्नव,
 ‘descendant of Jahnu,’ is the patronymic of Vis4va1mitra in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxi. 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 32; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54. This fact is of some importance as disproving Aufrecht's theory 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 424. that the Jahnus were the clan of Aji1garta the father of S4unah2s4epa.

जित्वन्शैलिनि
जित्वन् शैलिनि
 is the name of a teacher in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 1) iv. 1, 2 (Ka1n2va = iv. 1, 5 Ma1dhyam2dina, which has S4ailina as the patronymic). a contemporary of Janaka and Ya1jn5avalkya. He held that speech (va1c) was Brahman.

जिह्वावन्त्बाध्योग
जिह्वावन्त् बाध्योग
 is the name, in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 1) vi. 5, 3 (Ka1n2va = vi. 4, 33 Ma1dhyam2dina). of a teacher, pupil of Asita Va1rs2a1gan2a.

जीवगृभ्
जीव-गृभ्,
 ‘seizing alive,’ is, according to Roth, 1) St Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Siebenzig Lieder, 174. the term for a police official in the Rigveda. 2) x. 97, 11. But although this sense is rendered possible by the mention of Madhyamas4i1, perhaps ‘arbitrator,’ in the same passage, 3) Rv. x. 97, 12. it is neither necessary nor probable. 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 180.

Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 960. where the edition of Roth and Whitney has the unjustified emendation Ji1vala. 2) With this conjectural form, cf.

जूर्णि
जूर्णि,
 ‘firebrand,’ is regarded by Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 301. as one of the weapons of the Vedic Indians. But since it is only mentioned in the Rigveda 2) i. 129, 8. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 4. as a weapon used by demons, its employment in normal war cannot be safely assumed.

जूर्णी

जैत्रायणसहोजित्
जैत्रायण सहो-जित्
 is apparently in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 1) xviii. 5. the name of a prince who celebrated the Ra1jasu1ya, or ‘royal consecration.’ Von Schroeder 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 168. quotes in support of Jaitra1yan2a as a proper name the derivative Jaitra1yan2i, ‘descendant of Jaitra,’ formed according to the Gan2a karn2a1di, which is referred to by Pa1n2ini; 3) iv. 2, 80. but it should be noted that in the parallel passage of the Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1 4) xxviii. 5, cited by von Schroeder Ka1t2haka, 1, p. 269. the reading is different, and no proper personal name appears, the subject being Indra, the god. This reading seems much more probable, for the verse should be general, and suit every king performing the rite.

 does not appear till the Su1tra period. 1) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 4; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 10; vi. 6, etc. He appears also as a pupil of Vya1sa, Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a, ad fin.; Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 377. Cf. his Indian Literature, 56. But a Jaimini1ya Sam2hita1 of the Sa1maveda is extant, and has been edited and discussed by Caland; 2) As part ii. of Hillebrandt's Indische Forschungen, Breslau, 1907.

जैवन्तायन
जैवन्तायन,
 ‘descendant of Ji1vanta,’ is mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) iv. 5, 26 (Ma1dhyam2dina). The name is recognised by Pa1n2ini, iv. 1, 103. as a teacher, with S4aunaka and Raibhya, of Rauhin2a1yana.

जैवल
जैवल
 or Jaivali, ‘descendant of Ji1vala,’ is the patronymic of Prava1han2a in the Br2hada1ran2yaka 1) vi. 2, 1 (Ka1n2va = vi. 1, 1 Ma1dhyam2dina), where the form is Jaivala. and Cha1ndogya Upanis2ads. 2) i. 8, 1. 2. 8; v. 3, 1. Jaivali, the king, in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 3) i. 38, 4. is the same person.

ज्ञातृ
ज्ञातृ
 occurs in two passages of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 32, 3; viii. 8, 21. and one of the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 2) xii. 14. Cf. Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 66, n. 4. with a somewhat obscure sense. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 181. conjectures not unnaturally that the word is a technical term taken from law, meaning ‘witness.’ The reference is, perhaps, to a custom of carrying on transactions of business before witnesses as practised in other primitive societies. 4) In Manu, viii. 57, the word is a various reading for sa1ks2in, ‘witness.’ Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 140. Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. suggests that the word has the sense of ‘surety.’ But Bloomfield 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 475. and Whitney 7) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 306. ignore these interpretations.

ज्ञाति
ज्ञाति
 (masc.), a word which originally seems to have meant ‘acquaintance,’ 1) Being in all probability derived from jn5a1, ‘know,’ not from jan, ‘beget,’ as would at first sight seem more likely on account of the sense. Cf. the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. denotes in the Rigveda 2) vii. 55, 5, seems to refer to the members of the joint family sleeping in the paternal house; x. 66, 14; 85, 28 (the kinsmen of the bride are meant); 117, 9 (perhaps ‘brother and sister’ are meant by jn5a1ti1 here, but ‘kinsfolk’ will do; of. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 432). and later 3) Av. xii. 5, 44 (where Whitney in his Translation renders the word by ‘acquaintances,’ which seems too vague and feeble); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 5, 2; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 4, 3 (jn5a1tibhya1m2 va1 sakhibhya1m2, va1, ‘where ‘relations’ are contrasted with ‘friends’ or ‘companions’); ii. 2, 2, 20; 5, 2, 20; xi. 3, 3, 7, etc. a ‘relation,’ apparently one who was connected by blood on the father's side, though the passages do not necessarily require the limitation. But this sense follows naturally enough from the patriarchal basis of Vedic society. 4) For the transition from the etymological meaning, cf. , which in Homer designate ‘brother’ and ‘sister’; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

ज्या
ज्या
 is the regular word for ‘bowstring’ in the Rigveda 1) iv. 27, 3; vi. 75, 3; x. 51, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 1, 3; v. 13, 6; vi. 42, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 9; xxix. 51, etc. The making of bowstrings was a special craft, as is shown by the occurrence of the Jya1-ka1ra, or ‘maker of bowstrings,’ among the victims at the Purus2amedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 7; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 3, 1. The bowstring consisted of a thong of ox-hide. 4) Rv. vi. 75, 3; Av. i. 1, 3. In the Epic the bowstring is made of hemp (maurvi1); Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 271. It was not usually kept taut, 5) Av. vi. 42, 1. but was specially tightened when the bow was to be used. 6) Rv. x. 166, 3. The sound of the bowstring (jya1-ghos2a) is referred to in the Atharvaveda. 7) v. 21, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 298 299. Cf. A1rtni1. 

ज्याका
ज्याका
 means ‘bowstring,’ with a contemptuous sense, in the Rigveda, 1) x. 133, 1, where anyakes2a1m2 jya1ka1h2 is unmistakably contemptuous. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 137. and in the simple sense in the Atharvaveda. 2) i. 2, 2.

ज्यापाश
ज्या-पाश
 means ‘bowstring’ in the Atharvaveda (xi. 10, 22).

ज्याह्रोड
ज्या-ह्रोड
 occurs in the description of the arms of the Vra1tya in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xvii. 1, 14 (spelt -hn2od2a in text, -hnod2a in comm.). and is also mentioned in the Su1tras. 2) Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 4, 11 (spelt -hrod2a); La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 6, 8 (spelt -hnod2a: the editor notes that the Dra1hya1yan2a Su1tra has the same reading). The sense is somewhat obscure, for one Su1tra describes it as a ‘bow not meant for use’ (ayogyam2 dhanus), 3) Ka1tya1yana, loc. cit. while the other speaks of it as a ‘bow without an arrow’ (dhanus2ka anis2u). 4) La1t2ya1yana, loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 38; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Acad my of Arts and Sciences, 15, 32; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 33, 52. Some sort of a bow, therefore, seems to be meant.

ज्येष्ठ
ज्येष्ठ,
 ordinarily meaning ‘greatest,’ has further the specific sense of ‘eldest’ 1) With changed accent, jyes2t2ha4. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 83, 14. brother in the Rigveda. 2) iv. 33, 5; x. 11, 2. It also means the eldest among sons, which is another side of the same sense. 3) Av. xii. 2, 35; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 3, 8, and cf. Jyais2thineya.

ज्येष्ठघ्नी
ज्येष्ठ-घ्नी,
 ‘slaying the eldest,’ is the name of a Naks2atra, or lunar mansion, usually called Jyes2t2ha1, in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 110, 2. Cf. vi. 112, 1. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 2) i. 5, 2, 8. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 361. It is Antares or Cor Scipionis.

ज्येष्ठा
ज्येष्ठा
 See Naks2atra. 

ज्यैष्ठिनेय
ज्यैष्ठिनेय
 denotes, in combination with Jyes2t2ha, the eldest,’ a ‘son of the father's first wife’ (jyes2t2ha1), in the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 8, 1 (opposed to hanis2t2ha and ha1nis2t2hineya); Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 2; xx. 5, 2.

ज्योतिष
ज्योतिष,
 ‘astronomy.’ It is important to note that no reference to any work on astronomy occurs in the Sam2hita1s or Bra1hman2as. The text which claims to represent the astronomical science of the Veda has been edited by Weber, 1) Ueber den Vedakalender namens Jyotis2am (1862). and has frequently been discussed since. 2) See references in Thibaut, Astrenomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 20, 29. Its date is unknown, but is undoubtedly late, as is shown alike by the contents and form of the work.

ज्वालायन
ज्वालायन,
 ‘descendant of Jva1la,’ is the name of a man, a pupil of Gaus2u1kti, mentioned in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iv. 16, 1), in a list of teachers. JH.

झष
झष
 is mentioned in the story of Manu told in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) i. 8, 1, 4. where it means a ‘great fish’ (maha1-matsya) according to the commentator. Eggeling 2) Sacred Books of the East, 12, 217, n. 3; 26, xxxi. suggests that a horned fish is meant, because in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) i. 7, 1; ii. 6, 7. the Id2a1, or personified libation, is represented as a cow, and this may have brought in the idea of a horned fish in the later form of an old legend. But cf. Jas2a. T.

तकवान
तकवान
 appears to be a patronymic from Taku, 1) Cf. Bhr2gava1n2a, from Bhr2gu; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Taku, as an adjective(?), occurs in Rigveda, ix. 97, 52. and to be the name of a seer in the Rigveda, 2) i. 120, 6. presumably a descendant of Taku Kaks2i1vant, for his name occurs in a group of hymns composed by the Ka1ks2i1vatas. 3) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 221. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 92; Ludwig, U7ber Methode bei Interpretation des R2gveda, 47.

तक्मन्
तक्मन्
 is a disease repeatedly mentioned in the Atharvaveda, but later not known under this name. It is the subject of five hymns 1) i. 25; v. 22; vi. 20; vii. 116; xix. 39 (cf. v. 4). of the Atharvaveda, and is often mentioned elsewhere. 2) Av. iv. 9, 8; v. 4. 1. 9; 30, 16; ix. 8, 6; xi. 2, 22. 26, etc. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 4, 119; Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschishte des Weda, 39, had, from the use of Kus2t2ha as a remedy, regarded it as denoting ‘leprosy,’ and was followed by Pictet, Kuhn's Zeitschrift 5, 337. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 4, 280, thought ‘consumption’ was meant. first identified it with ‘fever,’ and Grohmann 4) Indische Studien, 9, 381 et seq. showed that all the symptoms pointed to that ailment. 5) See also Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 451 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 379-385, and compare the jvara (a non-Vedic word) of the classical medicine, Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 219 et seq.; Jolly, Medicin, 70-72. Da1rila and Kes4ava, the commentators on the Kaus4ika Su1tra, everywhere equate takman and jvara. Reference is made to the alternate hot and shivering fits of the patient, 6) Av. i. 25, 2-4; v. 22, 2. 7. 10; vi. 20, 3; vii. 116, 1. to the yellow colour of the jaundice which accompanies the fever, 7) Av. i. 25, 2; v. 22, 2; vi. 20, 3. and to its peculiar periodicity. The words used to describe its varieties are anye-dyuh2, 8) Av. i. 25, 4; vii. 116, 2. ubhaya-dyuh2, 9) Ibid. tr2ti1yaka, 10) Av. i. 25, 4; v. 22, 13; xix. 39, 10. vi-tr2ti1ya, 11) Av. v. 22, 13. and sadam2-di, 12) Av. v. 22, 13; xix. 39, 10. the exact sense of most of which terms is somewhat uncertain. It is agreed 13) Grohmann, op. cit., 387; Zimmer, op. cit., 382; Bloomfield, op. cit., 274. that the first epithet designates the fever known as quotidianus, which recurs each day at the same hour, though the word is curious (lit. ‘on the other--i.e., next, day’). The ubhaya-dyuh2 (‘on both days’) variety appears to mean a disease recurring for two successive days, the third being free; this corresponds to the rhythmus quartanus complicatus. 14) Grohmann, 388; Zimmer, 382; Bloomfield, 274. It may conceivably be the form styled Ca1turthaka Viparyaya (Wise, op. cit., 232), in which the paroxysm occurs every fourth day, and lasts for two days. But Sa1yan2a considers that it means a fever recurring on the third day, the ‘tertian.’ The tr2ti1yaka, however, must be the ‘tertian’ fever, 15) Sa1yan2a on Av. i. 25, 4; Bloomfield, 451. It is the jvara tr2ti1yaka of Sus4ruta (2, 404, 7). though Zimmer 16) Op. cit., 383, quoting Hu7gel, Kashmir, 1, 133. suggests that it may mean a fever which is fatal at the third paroxysm. Grohmann 17) Op. cit., 388. regards the vi-tr2ti1yaka as equivalent to the tertiana duplicata, a common form in southern countries, in which the fever occurs daily, but with a correspondence in point of time or severity of attack on alternate days. Bloomfield 18) Op. cit., 451. suggests that it is identical with the ubhaya-dyuh2 variety. The sadam2-di 19) Of doubtful derivation: either ‘always cutting’ (of Sa1yan2a on Av. xix. 39, 10), or ‘always fastening upon’ (Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.), or ‘belonging to every day’ = sadam2dina (Zimmer, 383, n.; Bloomfield, 452). type appears to be the kind later known as sam2tata-jvara (‘continuous fever’), in which there are attacks of several days’ duration, with an interval followed by a fresh period of attack. Fever occurred at different seasons, in the autumn (s4a1rada), in the hot weather (grais2ma), in the rains (va1rs2ika), 20) Av. v. 22, 13. but was especially prevalent in the first, as is indicated by the epithet vis4va-s4a1rada, ‘occurring every autumn.’ 21) Av. ix. 8, 6; xix. 34, 10. The disease is said to arise when Agni enters the waters. 22) Av. 1, 25. 1. From this Weber 23) Indische Studien, 4, 119. deduced that it was considered to be the result of a chill supervening on heat, or the influence of heat on marshy land. Grohmann 24) Ibid., 9, 493. preferred to see in this connexion of the origin of the disease with Agni's entering the waters 25) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. an allusion to the fact that fever arises in the rainy season, the time when Agni, as lightning, descends to earth with the rain. Zimmer. 26) Of. cit., 384. who accepts this view, further refers to the prevalence of fever in the Terai, and interprets vanya, an epithet of fever found in the Atharvaveda, 27) Av. vi. 20, 4. as meaning ‘sprung from the forest,’ pointing out that fever is mentioned as prevalent among the Mu1javants and Maha1vr2s2as, two mountain tribes of the western Hima1laya. 28) Av. v. 22, 5. There is no trace of fever having been observed to be caused by the bite of the anopheles mosquito, which breeds in stagnant water: this theory has without reason been held to be known to classical Indian medicine. 29) Jolly, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 222. Among the symptoms of Takman, or among complications accompanying it, are mentioned ‘itch’ (Pa1man), ‘headache’ (s4i1rs2a-s4oka), 30) Av. xix. 39, 10. For the present position of the disease in India, cf. the Report of the Simla Conference of 1909. ‘cough’ (Ka1sika1), and ‘consumption,’ or perhaps some form of itch (Bala1sa). It is perhaps significant that the Takman does not appear until the Atharvaveda. It is quite possible that the Vedic A1ryans, when first settled in India, did not know the disease, which would take some generations to become endemic and recognized as dangerous. What remedies they used against it is quite uncertain, for the Atharvaveda mentions only spells and the Kus2t2ha, which can hardly have been an effective remedy, though still used in later times. Fever must, even in the Atharvan period, have claimed many victims, or it would not be mentioned so prominently.

 ‘grain,’ especially ‘rice grain,’ is mentioned very often in the Atharvaveda 1) x. 9, 26; xi. 1, 18; xii. 3, 18. 29. 30. and later, 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 6; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 1, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 3; ii. 5, 3, 4; v. 2, 3, 2; vi. 6, 1, 8, etc.; s4ya1ma1ka-tan2d2ula, ‘millet grain,’ ibid., x. 6, 3, 2; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 14, 3; apa1ma1rga-tan2d2ula, ‘grain of the Achyranthes aspera,’ v. 2, 4, 15, etc. but not in the Rigveda. This accords with the fact that rice cultivation seems hardly known in the Rigveda. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 239. See Vri1hi. Husked (karn2a) and unhusked (akarn2a) rice is referred to in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 4) i. 8, 9, 3. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 190. 

तत
तत,
 ‘dada,’ is the pet name for ‘father’ in the Rigveda 1) viii. 91, 6; ix. 112, 3. and later. 2) Av. v. 24, 16; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 5, 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 9, 7; in the vocative as a form of address, Av. viii. 4, 77; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 14; vii. 15; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 3, 3. Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 449. Cf. Ta1ta and Pitr2.

ततामह
ततामह,
 ‘grandfather,’ is found in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 24, 17; viii. 4, 76. It seems to mean literally ‘great father,’ and to be an analogical formation following pita1maha; Delbru7ck, op. cit., 473, 474.

तनय
तनय,
 n., denotes ‘offspring,’ ‘descendants’ in the Rigveda, 1) i. 96, 4; 183, 3; 184, 5; ii. 23, 19; vii. 1, 21, etc.; tokam2 ca tanayam2 ca, i. 92, 13; ix. 74, 5. Cf. vi. 25, 4; 31, 1; 66, 8; and i. 31, 12, as explained by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 3, 193. where also it is often used adjectivally with Toka. 2) Rv. i. 64, 14; 114, 6; 147, 1; 189, 2; ii. 30, 5, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7. There seems no ground for the view 3) Nirukta, x. 7; xii. 6. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Tan, tana, and tanas, have the same sense as Tanaya. See Rv. vi. 46, 12; 49, 13; vii. 104, 10; viii. 68, 12, etc. (tan); viii. 25, 2 (tana); v. 70, 4 (tanas). that toka means ‘sons,’ ‘children,’ and tanaya ‘grandchildren.’

तन्ति
तन्ति
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 24, 4. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders the plural of the word by ‘files’ of calves. But it seems rather to have the sense which it has in the later literature, of ‘cords,’ here used to fasten the calves.

तन्तु
तन्तु
 appears properly to mean ‘thread,’ and in particular the ‘warp’ of a piece of weaving, as opposed to Otu, the ‘woof.’ Both senses are found in the Atharvaveda. 1) xiv. 2, 51 (opposed to otu); xv. 3, 6 (the pra1n5cah2 and tiryan5cah2 threads or cords of the throne of the Vra1tya [A1sandi1]). In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) iii. 1, 2, 18; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 8, 9. the ‘warp’ is called anucha1da, the ‘woof’ parya1sa, the tantavah2 being the ‘threads.’ In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 3) vi. 1, 1, 4. on the other hand, the ‘warp’ is pra1ci1na-ta1na, the ‘woof’ otu. The threads or cords of the throne (Pary n3ka) are referred to in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad. 4) i. 5; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 20, n. 2. In the Rigveda the word is used only metaphorically, and this is its most frequent use even in the Bra1hmanas. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. It is applied to the filaments of plants in Rv. x. 134, 5; to the spider's web in Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanisad. ii. 1, 23. See also Va1n2a.

तन्त्र
तन्त्र
 means, like Tantu, the ‘warp’ of a piece of weaving, or more generally the ‘web’ itself. It is found in the Rigveda 1) x. 71, 9. and later. 2) Av. x. 7, 42; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 5, 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, x. 5; S4atapa ha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 2, 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 254.

तपस्
तपस्, तपस्य
 See Ma1sa.

तपोनित्य
तपो-नित्य
 (‘constant in penance’) Pauru-s4is2t2i (‘descendant of Purus4is2t2a’) is the name of a teacher in the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad (i. 9, 1) who believed in the value of penance (tapas).

तयादर
तयादर
 is the name of an animal only mentioned in the adjectival form ta1ya1dara along with Parasvant, ‘wild ass’(?) in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 72, 2. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 335.

तरक्षु
तरक्षु,
 the ‘hyæna,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 19, 1, where Sa1yan2a explains the animal to be ‘a kind of tiger with an ass's appearance’ (vya1ghra-vis4es2o gardabha1ka1rah2); Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 21; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 40. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81. 

तरन्त
तरन्त
 appears, along with Purumi1d2ha, as a patron of S4ya1va1s4va in the Rigveda. 1) v. 61, 10. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 7, 12. and other Bra1hman2as 3) Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 139; S4a1t2ya1yanaka apud Sa1yan2a on Rv. ix. 38, 3 = Sa1maveda, ii. 410. he, together with Purumi1d2ha, is described as receiving gifts from Dhvasra 4) Rv. ix. 58, 3. and Purus2anti; but since the receipt of gifts was forbidden to Ks2atriyas, they for the nonce became R2s2is, and composed a passage in honour of the donors. 4) Rv. ix. 58. 3. He, like Purumi1d2ha, was a Vaidadas4vi, or son of Vidadas4va. 5) Cf. Rv. v. 61, 10; notes 2 and 3. This is merely a misunderstanding of the Rv. Cf. Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 39; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 50 et seq.; 62, 63; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 232, n. 1; R2gveda-Noten, 1, 353, 354, where he points out that the Bra1hman2a tradition, and that of the Br2haddevata1 (v. 50-81, with Macdonell's notes), are not to be accepted as real explanations of the Rigveda.

तरु
तरु,
 the usual term for ‘tree’ in classical Sanskrit, never occurs in Vedic literature, except perhaps in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) v. 44, 5. where Sa1yan2a finds it, and where it can be so translated. But the form (tarubhih2) is probably to be interpreted otherwise. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., cites tarobhih2 in Rv. ii. 39, 3, as a parallel, and so Oldenberg, R2gvedaNoten, 1, 341.

तरुक्ष
तरुक्ष
 is the name of a man in the Rigveda 1) viii. 46, 32. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 117. who is mentioned along with Balbu1tha, the Da1sa, in a Da1na-stuti, or ‘Praise of Gifts.’

तर्कु
तर्कु,
 ‘spindle,’ is known only in Vedic literature from the mention of it in Ya1ska's Nirukta (ii. 1) as an example of the transposition of letters, the word being derived, according to him, from the root kart, ‘to spin.’ 

तर्द
तर्द,
 ‘borer,’ occurs in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 50, 1. 2. enumerating insects that injure grain. Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 318. suggests that a kind of mouse or rat may be meant. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 485. thought a bird was denoted.

तर्द्मन्
तर्द्मन्
 in the Atharvaveda 1) xiv. 1, 40. applies to the hole in the yoke (Yuga). In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) iii. 2, 1, 2; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 26, n. 1. it designates a hole in a skin.

तर्य
तर्य
 is, according to Sa1yan2a, the name of a man in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) v, 44, 12. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158, 159. But the verse is hopelessly obscure. 2) Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 342.

तलाश
तलाश
 is the name of a tree in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 15, 3. Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 291. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. suggests that it may be the same as ta1li1s4a (Flacourtia cataphracta).

तल्प
तल्प
 is the regular term for ‘bed’ or ‘couch’ from the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda 1) Rv. vii. 55, 8; Av. v. 17, 12; xiv. 2, 31. 41. onwards. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 6, 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 5, 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiii. 4, 2; xxv. 1, 10. One made of Udumbara wood is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 3) i. 2, 6, 5. The violation of the bed of a Guru, or teacher, is already mentioned in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 4) v. 10, 9. while the adjective talpya, ‘born in the nuptial couch,’ denotes ‘legitimate’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 5) xiii. 1, 6, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 154. 

तलव
तलव
 in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda, 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 20; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 15, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 83, n. 15. denotes a ‘musician’ of some kind.

तष्टृ
तष्टृ
 is found in the Rigveda 1) i. 61, 4; 105, 18; 130, 4; iii. 38, 1; vii. 32, 20; x. 93, 12; 119, 5. Cf. Nirukta, v. 21. in the sense of ‘carpenter,’ like Taks2an, which is from the same root taks2, ‘to fashion.’

तसर
तसर
 denotes the weaver's ‘shuttle’ in the Rigveda 1) x. 130, 2. and the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 83; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxviii. 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 4, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 254.

तस्कर
तस्कर
 occurs in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 5; vi. 27, 3; vii. 55, 3; viii. 29, 6. and frequently later, 2) Av. iv. 3, 2; xix. 47, 7; 50, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 77-78; xii. 62; xvi. 21, etc; Nirukta, iii. 14. denoting ‘thief’ or ‘robber.’ It appears to be practically synonymous with Stena, in connexion with which it is often mentioned. 3) Rv. vii. 55. 3; Av. xix. 47, 7; 50, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 79; xvi. 21, etc. The Stena and the Taskara are contrasted in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 4) xi. 79 (the Malimlu is janes2u, ‘among men’; the others vane, ‘in the forest’). Cf. for the Malimlu, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 3, 2, 6; Atharvaveda, xix. 49, 10. with the Malimlu, who is a burglar or house-breaker, while they are highwaymen, or, as the Rigveda 5) x. 4, 6. puts it, ‘men who haunt the woods and risk their lives’ (tanu1-tyaja1 vanar-gu1). In another passage of the Rigveda, 6) vii. 55, 3. however, the dog is told to bark at the Taskara or the Stena, which clearly points to an attempt at house-breaking. The thief goes about at night, 7) Rv. i. 191, 5. and knows the paths 8) Rv. viii. 29, 6. on which he attacks his victim. In one passage of the Rigveda 9) x. 4, 6. the use of cords is mentioned, but whether to bind the thieves when captured, or to bind the victim, is not clear. 10) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 178, n. The Atharvaveda 11) xix. 50, 5. Cf. Rv. x. 97, 10 (stena). refers to the Stena and the Taskara as cattle and horse thieves. 12) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 984.

तायु
तायु
 was another name for thief, perhaps of a less distinguished and more domestic character than the highwayman, for though he is referred to as a cattle-thief, 13) Rv. i. 65, 1; vii. 86, 5. he is also alluded to as a stealer of clothes (vastra-mathi) 14) Rv. iv. 38, 5. and as a debtor. 15) Rv. vi. 12, 5. No doubt this theft is the result of despair at being in debt, which might lead to loss of liberty (R2n2a). In one passage the Ta1yus are said to disappear at the coming of dawn (which is elsewhere called ya1vayad-dves2as, ‘driving away hostile beings,’ and r2ta-pa1, ‘guardian of order’), like the stars of heaven (naks2atra). 16) Rv. i. 50, 2. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 47. In the S4atarudriya litany of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 17) xvi. 20, 21. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 4, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 4. Rudra is called lord of assailers (a1-vya1dhin), thieves (stena), robbers (taskara), pickpockets (sta1yu), stealers (mus2n2ant), and cutters (vi-kr2nta); and designations of sharpers (gr2tsa) and bands (gan2a, vra1ta), apparently of robbers, are mentioned. 18) xvi. 25. It is therefore not surprising that the Rigveda 19) i. 129, 9; ii. 23, 16; vi. 24, 10; 41, 5; 51, 15; x. 63, 16. should contain many prayers for safety at home or on the way, or that the Atharvaveda should devote several hymns to night 20) Av. xix. 47-50. chiefly for protection against the evil doings of thieves and robbers. Pischel 21) Vedische Studien, 2, 55, 56. Contrast 1, 106. suggests that in one passage of the Rigveda 22) Rv. vii. 55. Vasis2t2ha is represented as a burglar, but the admits that, since Vasis2t2ha was attacking the house of his father Varun2a, he was only seeking to obtain what he may have regarded as his own. But the interpretation of the hymn is not certain. 23) Cf. Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 337 et seq.; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 370; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 308; Br2haddevata1, vii. 11 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. Sa1yan2a's explanation of one passage of the Rigveda, 24) vi. 54, 1. as referring to professional cattle-trackers, like the Khojis of the Panjab, seems quite probable. 25) Zimmer, op. cit., 182, 183, citing Elliot, Memoirs, 1, 276; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 123. The punishment of thieves appears primarily to have been left to the action of the robbed. The practice of binding them in stocks 26) Cf. Rv. i. 24, 13, 15; vii. 86, 5; Av. vi. 63, 3 = 84, 4; 115, 2. 3; 121; xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, all of which passages are cited by Zimmer, 181, 182, to prove this practice. But it must be noted that Rv. vii. 86, 5, alone is not at all conclusive evidence, though Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1 (drupade a1han), probably mean the same thing. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 976, 983, renders the passages as referring to casting a thief into a snare, and Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 106, makes Rv. vii. 86, 5, refer to the cattle-thief (pas4u-tr2p) taking away the rope from the calf he means to steal. For Rv. x. 4, 6, see above, n. 10. The German and Slavonic parallels cited by Zimmer, 182, n., support his view. See also for a similar punishment in case of debt, R2n2a. seems clearly referred to. But later, at any rate-and in all probability earlier also, as in othe countries--a more severe penalty could be exacted, and death inflicted by the king. 27) Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xii. 4345; A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, i. 9, 25, 4. 5; Jolly, op. cit., 124. There is no hint in Vedic literature of the mode of conviction; a fire ordeal is not known to the Atharvaveda, 28) Av. ii. 12 was so interpreted by Schlagintweit, Die Gottesurtheile der Inder, 9 et seq. (1866); Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 164 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 445; Zimmer, 183 et seq.; but see Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 330 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 294-296; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 54; Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 47, 85; Jolly, op cit., 146. and the ordeal known to the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 29) vi. 16; Jolly, loc. cit. is not said to be used in the case of theft. No doubt the stolen property was recovered by the person robbed if he could obtain it. Nothing is known as to what happened if the property had passed from the actual thief into the possession of another person.

तस्तुव
तस्तुव,
 or Tasruva, as the Paippala1da recension has it, is the name of a remedy against snake poison, and is mentioned along with Ta1buva in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 13, 10, 11. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 428; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 244. 

ताजद्भङ्ग
ताजद्-भङ्ग
 (‘easily broken’) is apparently the name of a tree or plant in the Atharvaveda. 1) viii. 8, 3 (a battle hymn). The Kaus4ika Su1tra 2) xvi 14. Cf. Bloomfield's edition, xliv; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 583, 584; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 35; Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 502; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. treats it as a compound word, and its commentator makes it out to be the castor-oil plant (eran2d2a). Whitney, 3) Op. cit., 504. however, treats the expression as two separate words, and thinks that the passage means ‘may they be broken suddenly (ta1jat) like hemp (bhan5ga).’

ताण्ड
ताण्ड
 seems to be the name of a sage to whose school belonged the Ta1n2d2a Bra1hman2a mentioned in the La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra. 1) vii. 10, 17. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 49.

ताण्डविन्द
ताण्ड-विन्द,
 or Ta1n2d2a-vindava, is the name of a teacher mentioned in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka. 1) viii. 10. The manuscripts differ as to the form of the name.

ताण्डि
ताण्डि
 occurs as the name of a pupil of Ba1dara1yan2a in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) at the end of the Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a. 1) See Konow's Translation, 80, n. 2.

ताण्ड्य
ताण्ड्य
 is the name of a teacher in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) vi. 1, 2, 25. Cf. Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 140. quoted on a point bearing on the Agniciti, or piling of the sacred fire. He is also mentioned in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 2) Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 373, 384. The Ta1n2d2ya Maha1bra1hman2a or Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 3) Edited in the Bibliotheca Indica Series, 1869-74. See Weber, Indian Literature, 66 et seq., 74, 133; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 203, 210; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 23 et seq. of the Sa1maveda represents the school of the Ta1n2d2ins. 

तात
तात,
 apparently ‘dada's boy,’ an affectionate term of address by a father (cf. Tata) to a son, is found in the Bra1hman2as, 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 14, 4; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 6; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 4, 2. occurring in the vocative only. But in the sense of ‘father,’ through confusion with Tata, it occurs also as early as the Aitareya A1ran2yaka. 2) i. 3, 3, where Tata and Ta1ta are given as variant forms of the address of the child to the father. Little, Grammatical Index, 75, takes Ta1ta to mean ‘father’ primarily, but this seems unlikely. Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 449, 454.

तादुरी
तादुरी
 is mentioned in a verse of the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 15, 14. together with the female frog (Man2d2u1ki1). Some similar animal must be meant, 2) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 175. but Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., where he suggests ta1d2uri1, from the root tad2, ‘beat,’ with the sense of ‘splashing.’ with the commentator Durga on the Nirukta, 4) ix. 7. regards the word as an adjective describing the frog.

तान्व
1. Ta1nva in an obscure passage of the Rigveda 1) iii. 31, 2. seems to mean a ‘legitimate son,’ who is said not to leave the heritage (riktha) of his father to his sister (ja1mi). The exact meaning is probably unascertainable, 2) Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 348; Oldenberg, R2gveda Noten, 1, 240; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 34. but the passage may convey a statement of what was no doubt the fact, that the daughter had no share in the paternal inheritance; her brother had to provide for her during her life if she remained unmarried, but she had no independent portion. 3) Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 87, for the modern law of the Panjab. (See Da1ya.)

तान्व
2. Ta1nva appears to be a patronymic, ‘descendant of Tanva,’ in a verse of the Rigveda. 1) x. 93, 15. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. thinks that it is the patronymic of Duh2s4i1ma, who is mentioned in the preceding verse, but this is uncertain. 

तापस
1. Ta1pasa, ‘ascetic,’ is not found in Vedic literature till the Upanis2ads. 1) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 22. Cf. Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 40.

तापस
2. Ta1pasa is a name of Datta who was Hotr2 priest at the snake festival described in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xxv. 15).

ताबुव
ताबुव
 is the name in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 13, 10. of a remedy against snake poison. The Paippala1da recension has Ta1vuca instead. Weber 2) Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1896, 681. thinks that the original form was Ta1thuva, from the root stha1, ‘stand,’ and that it meant ‘stopping’; but this is hardly probable. 3) Barth. Revne del'Histoire des Religions, 39, 26. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 244; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 428.

तायादर
तायादर,
 ‘belonging to the Taya1dara’ (Av. vi. 72, 2).

तायु
तायु,
 ‘thief,’ is mentioned several times in the Rigveda. 1) i. 50, 2; 65, 1; iv. 38, 5; v. 15, 5; 52, 12; vi. 12, 5; vii. 86, 5 (pas4u-tr2t2, ‘cattle-thief,’ see Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 106). See Taskara.

तारका
तारका
 is found several times in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 8, 1; iii. 7, 4; vi. 121, 3; xix. 49, 8. denoting a star. The masculine form Ta1raka occurs in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 2) i. 5, 2, 5.

तारुक्ष्य
तारुक्ष्य
 is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya 1) iii. 1, 6. and S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yakas. 2) vii. 19. In the former passage Ta1rks2ya is a variant reading, and in the latter Ta1rks2ya is read, but this is probably only due to confusion with Ta1rks2ya, the reputed author of a Rigvedic hymn. 3) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 5, 2, with Keith's note; Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra xi. 14, 28; xii. 11, 12, A1s4vala1yana Srauta Su1tra, ix. 1. 

तार्क्ष्य
तार्क्ष्य
 is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 89, 6; x. 178. as a divine steed, apparently the sun conceived as a horse. 2) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 149. But Foy, 3) Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 11, 366, 367. judging by the name, apparently a patronymic of Tr2ks2i, who is known from the Rigveda 4) viii. 22, 7. onwards as a descendant of Trasadasyu, thinks that a real steed, the property of Tr2ks2i, is meant; but this is not very probable. 5) In Khila, ii. 4, 1, Ta1rks2ya is represented as a bird (va1yasa), also a symbol of the sun. In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 18, he is mentioned with Aris2t2anemi, originally an epithet of his (Rv. i. 89, 6; x. 178, 1), as a person, and in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 3, 13, he appears as Vaipas4yata (Vaipas4cita in A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 7), king of the birds (cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 369). See also Ta1ruks2ya.

तार्प्य
तार्प्य
 denotes, in the Atharvaveda 1) xviii. 4, 31. and later, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 11, 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 7, 1; 7, 6, 4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxi. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 5, 20; Ka1tya1yana S4ranta Su1tra, xv. 5, 7 et seq.; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 12, 19. a garment made of some material, the nature of which is uncertain. The commentators on the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) v. 3, 5, 20. Cf. Ka1tya1yana, loc. cit.; Sa1yan2a on Av., loc. cit.; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 879. suggest that a linen garment, or one thrice soaked in ghee, or one made of the tr2pa1 or of the triparn2a plant, is meant: it is doubtful whether the sense was known even to the author of the Bra1hman2a himself. Goldstu7cker's 4) Dictionary, s.v. abhis2ecani1ya. rendering of the word is ‘silken garment,’ which Eggeling 5) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 85, n. 1. is inclined to accept.^6

तार्ष्टाघ
तार्ष्टाघ,
 a species of tree, is mentioned in the Kaus4ika Su1tra, 1) xxv. 23. while the adjective formed from it, ta1rs2t2a1ghi1, ‘derived from the Ta1rs2t2a1gha tree,’ is found in the Atharvaveda. 2) v. 29, 15. Cf. Whitney's note in his Translation of the Atharvaveda. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 18, 280. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. thinks that the sars2apa, or mustard plant, is meant. 

तितउ
तितौ७
 1) On the peculiar form of this word, of. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 20, 3. is found once in the Rigveda 2) x. 71, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. denoting a ‘sieve,’ or perhaps ‘winnowing fan,’ which was used for purifying corn (saktu).

तित्तिर
तित्तिर, तित्तिरि,
 is the name of the partridge in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 1, 2; v. 5, 16, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 30, 36. The form Tittira occurs in the Maitra1yan2i1 Samhita1, iii. 14, 1. and the Bra1hman2as, 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 5; v. 5, 4, 6; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 154, 6 (Oertel, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 181). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 251. being presumably an onomatopoetic formation. The bird is described as having variegated plumage (bahu-ru1pa). It is usually associated with the Kapin5jala and Kalavin3ka.

तिथि
तिथि,
 as the name of a lunar day, the thirtieth part of a lunar month of rather over twenty-seven days, is only found in the later Su1tras, 1) Gobhila Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 1, 13; ii. 8, 12, 20; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 25; v. 2, etc. being completely unknown to the Bra1hman2as, in which the only day is the natural one. 2) Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 7, 8. See Ma1sa.

तिमिर्घदौरेश्रुत
तिमिर्घ दौरे-श्रुत
 (‘descendant of Du1res4ruta’) is mentioned as Agni1dh (‘fire-kindling’) priest at the snake sacrifice described in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

तिरश्च
तिरश्च
 is read in some manuscripts of the Atharvaveda 1) xv. 3, 5. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 776; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana Aran2yaka, 19, n. 3. in the description of the Vra1tya's throne (A1sandi1), meaning ‘the cross-pieces.’ But the reading should be tiras4cye, which is adjectival, and is used in the same sense. 

तिरश्चराजि
तिरश्च-राजि,
 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 10, 2; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94, 95, reports this form from the Av., but the text and Roth (St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.) read tiras4ci-ra1ji there. Tiras4ci-ra1ji, 2) Av. iii. 27, 2; vi. 56, 2; vii. 56, 1; x. 4, 13; xii. 3, 56. Tiras4ci1na-ra1ji, 3) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 13, 21; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 27. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 488, 553; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 68, n. 2; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 295-297. are variant forms of a name for ‘snake’ (lit., ‘striped across’), found in the later Sam2hita1s.

तिरश्ची
तिरश्ची
 is, according to the Anukraman2i1, the author of a Rigvedic hymn 1) viii. 95, 4. in which he appeals to Indra to hear his call. The Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xii. 6, 12. adopts this view of the name, and mentions a Tiras4ci1 A1n3girasa. But Roth 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 115. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 187; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90; Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 273. thinks that the word is not a proper name at all.

तिरश्चीनवंश
तिरश्चीन-वंश,
 ‘cross-beam,’ is used to denote a ‘beehive’ in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 1) iii. 1, 1. Cf. Little, Grammatical Index, 75. See also Vam2s4a.

तिरिन्दिर
तिरिन्दिर
 is mentioned in a Da1nastuti, or ‘Praise of Gifts,’ in the Rigveda 1) viii. 6, 46-48. as having, along with Pars4u, bestowed gifts on the singer. In the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xvi. 11. 20. this statement is represented by a tale that the Kan2va Vatsa obtained a gift from Tirindira Pa1ras4avya, Tirindira and Pars4u being in this version thus treated as one and the same man. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160, 161; 5, 142. sees in the Rigvedic passage a proof that the Yadus had gained a victory over Tirindira, and gave a part of the booty to the singers; but there is no proof whatever of the correctness of this interpretation, which Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 136, 137. shows to be most unlikely. Yadu princes must be meant by Tirindira and Pars4u, though Weber 5) Indische Studien, 4, 356, n.; Indian Literature, 3, 4; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 37, 38. thinks that the singers were Yadus, not the princes. The latter he holds to have been Iranian (cf. , and see Pars4u), and he thinks that in this there is evidence of continual close relations between India and Iran. This is perfectly possible, but the evidence for it is rather slight. 6 For the recent controversy as to Iranian names found at Boghaz-kio7i, cf. Jacobi, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 721 et seq.; Oldenberg, ibid., 1095-1100; Keith, ibid., 1100-1106; Sayce, ibid., 1106, 1107; Kennedy, ibid., 1107-1119. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 94 et seq., argues in favour of an early connexion of Iranians and Indians in Arachosia, where he places part of the action of the Rigveda. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 16, 277, holds that traces of Iranian connexion are signs of late date; Arnold, ibid., 18, 205 et seq., opposes this view.

तिरीट
तिरीट
 1) Meaning, according to later native lexicographers, ‘head-dress’ or ‘diadem.’ is found in the Atharvaveda 2) viii. 6, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 265; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 495. in the adjectival derivative tiri1t2in used of a demon, and presumably meaning ‘adorned with a tiara.’

तिर्य
तिर्य
 occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 7, 3. as an epithet of Karambha, ‘gruel.’ It is probably equivalent to tilya, ‘made of sesamum,’ as rendered by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Whitney, 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 155. but tiriya is read by Roth 4) See Whitney, loc. cit., with Lanman's additional note. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 377, construes the adjective with vis2am, and renders ‘the poison which comes in a horizontal direction’ (cf. tiryan5c). Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 121, amends to atiriya, ‘overflowing.’ Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 270; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 201. in the Ra1ja-nighan2t2u as a kind of rice.

तिर्यञ्चाङ्गिरस
तिर्यञ्च् आङ्गिरस
 is mentioned as a seer of Sa1mans, or Chants, in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xii. 6, 12. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160. The name is doubtless feigned. 

तिल
तिल
 denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 8, 3; vi. 140, 2; xviii. 3, 69; 4, 32. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 2, 10, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 12; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 1, 1, 3, etc. the sesamum plant, and particularly its grains, from which a rich oil (Taila) was extracted. It is often 3) Av. vi. 140, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit.; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 22; Cha1ndogva Upanis2ad, v. 10, 6, etc. mentioned in connexion with Ma1s2a, ‘kidney bean.’ The Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 4) Loc. cit. attributes the bean and the sesamum to the winter (hemanta) and the cool (s4is4ira) seasons. The stalk of the sesamum plant (tila-pin5ji1, 5) Av. ii. 8, 3. til-pin5ja 6) Av. xii. 2, 54.) was used for fuel, and the seed was boiled in the form of porridge (tilaudana 7) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 16; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 240.) for food.

तिल्वक
तिल्वक
 is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 8, 1, 16. as a tree (Symplocos racemosa), near which it is inauspicious to construct a grave. The adjectival derivative tailvaka, ‘made of the wood of the Tilvaka,’ is found in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 2) iii. 1, 9. and is employed to describe the yu1pa, or sacrificial post, in the S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) iii. 8.

तिष्य
तिष्य
 occurs twice in the Rigveda, 1) v. 54, 13; x. 64, 8 (with Kr2s4a1nu as in archer). apparently as the name of a star, 2) Weber, Naxatra, 2, 290; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 355; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 331; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 77, n. 1. though Sa1yan2a takes it to mean the sun. It is doubtless identical with the Avestan Tistrya. Later it is the name of a lunar mansion: see Naks2atra.

तिसृधन्व
तिसृ-धन्व,
 ‘a bow with three (arrows),’ is mentioned as a gift to the priest at the sacrifice in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) i. 8, 19, 1. and in the Bra1hman2as. 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 3, 4; ii. 7, 9, 2; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 1, 5, 10; xiv. 1, 1, 7. 

तुग्र
तुग्र
 appears in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 3; 117, 14; vi. 62, 6. as the name of the father of Bhujyu, a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, who is accordingly called Tugrya 2) Rv. viii. 3, 23; 74, 14. or Taugrya. 3) Rv. i. 117, 15; 118, 6; 182, 5. 6; viii. 5, 22; x. 39, 4. A different Tugra seems to be referred to in other passages of the Rigveda 4) vi. 20, 8; 26, 4; x. 49, 4. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328, 329; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 157. as an enemy of Indra.

तुग्र्य
तुग्र्य
 occurs in the Rigveda as a patronymic of Bhujyu, 1) Who is also called Tugrasya su1nu, Rv. vi. 62, 6. Cf. the use of Pajriya and perhaps Kr2s2n2iya in the patronymic sense without Vr2ddhi. but also in a passage 2) viii. 32, 20. in which no reference to Bhujyu appears to be meant, and in which it may mean ‘a man of the house of Tugra.’ A similar sense seems to occur in the locative plural feminine in the Rigveda, 3) i. 33, 15. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 47. where (supplying viks2u) the meaning must be ‘among the Tugrians.’ This explanation may also apply to the epithet of Indra 4) viii. 45, 29; 99, 7. or Soma, 5) viii. 1, 15, where, however, Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., suggests an alteration to make it refer to Indra. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 128. tugrya1-vr2dh, ‘rejoicing among the Tugrians.’

तुच्
तुच्
 in the Rigveda 1) viii. 18, 18; 27, 14; vi. 48, 9. occasionally occurs denoting ‘children.’ Tuj occurs rather more often in the same sense. 2) iii. 45, 4; iv. 1, 3; v. 41, 9; viii. 4, 15. Cf. Tanaya and Toka.

तुजि
तुजि
 is the name in the Rigveda 1) vi. 26, 4; x. 49, 4. of a prote4ge4 of Indra, who in another hymn 2) vi. 20, 8. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. appears to be called Tu1tuji.

तुमिञ्जऔपोदिति
तुमिञ्ज औपोदिति
 is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (i. 7, 2, 1) as a Hotr2 priest at a Sattra, or ‘sacrificial session,’ and as having been engaged in a discussion with Sus4ravas. 

तुरकावषेय
तुर कावषेय
 is mentioned in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) at the end of the tenth book of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) x. 6, 5, 9. as the source of the doctrine set forth in that book, and as separated, in the succession of teachers, from S4a1n2d2ilya by Yajn5avacas and Kus4ri. In the same Bra1hman2a 2) ix. 5, 2, 15. he is quoted by S4a1n2d2ilya as having erected a fire-altar on the Ka1roti1. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 3) iv. 27; vii. 34; viii. 21. he appears as a Purohita, or ‘domestic priest,’ of Janamejaya Pa1riks2ita, whom he consecrated king. In the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 4) vi. 5, 4 (Ka1n2va, not in Ma1dhyam2dina). and a Khila 5) i. 9, 6; Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 65, 190. he appears as an ancient sage. Oldenberg, 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 239. no doubt rightly, assigns him to the end of the Vedic period. He is probably 7) So the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. identical with Tura, the deva-muni, ‘saint of the gods,’ who is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 8) xxv. 14, 5. See Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 203, n.; Indian Literature, 120, 131; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, xviii.

तुरश्रवस्
तुर-श्रवस्
 is the name of a seer mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) ix. 4, 10. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 53; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 316. as having pleased Indra by two Sa1mans (Chants) of his composition. Indra in return appears to have given him the oblation of the Pa1ra1vatas on the Yamuna1.

तुर्यवाह्
तुर्य-वाह्,
 masc.; Turyauhi1, fem., ‘a four-year-old ox or cow,’ is mentioned in the later Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 3, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 11; 13, 17; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 10; xviii. 26, etc.

तुर्व
तुर्व
 occurs only once in the Rigveda (x. 62, 10), doubtless as a name of the Turvas4a people or king. 

तुर्वश
तुर्वश
 occurs frequently in the Rigveda as the name of a man or of a people, usually in connexion with Yadu. The two words usually occur in the singular without any connecting particle, Turvas4a Yadu or Yadu Turvas4a. 2) v. 31, 8. In a plural form the name Turvas4a occurs once with the Yadus, 3) i. 108, 8. and once alone 4) viii. 4, 18; singular with A1nava in viii. 4, 1. in a hymn in which the singular has already been used. In one passage 5) iv. 30, 17. the dual Turvas4a1-Yadu1 actually occurs, and in another 6) x. 62, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 220, n. 1. Yadus Turvas4 ca, ‘Yadu and Turva.’ In other passages 7) i. 4, 77; vi. 27, 7. Cf. viii. 4, 1. Turvas4a appears alone, while in one 8) vii. 19, 8. Turvas4a and Ya1dva occur. From these facts Hopkins 9) Op. cit., 258 et seq. deduces the erroneousness of the ordinary view, 10) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 122, 124; Oldenberg, Buddha, 404; Ludwig, op. cit., 153; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 64; Sanskrit Literature, 153 et seq., etc. according to which Turvas4a is the name of a tribe, the singular denoting the king, and regards Turvas4a as the name of the Yadu king. But the evidence for this is not conclusive. Without laying any stress on the argument based on the theory 11) Zimmer, 122, 124; Macdonell, 153, 154. that the ‘five peoples’ of the Rigveda are the Anus, Druhyus, Turvas4as, Yadus, and Pu1rus, it is perfectly reasonable to hold that the Turvas4as and Yadus were two distinct though closely allied tribes. Such they evidently were to the seers of the hymns which mention in the dual the Turvas4a1-Yadu1 and speak of Yadus Turvas4 ca. This explanation also suits best the use of the plural of Turvas4a in two Rigvedic hymns. In the Rigveda the chief exploit of Turvas4a was his participation in the war against Suda1s, by whom he was defeated. 12) vii. 18, 6. Hopkins 13) Op. cit., 264. suggests that he may have been named Turvas4a because of his fleet (tura) escape from the battle. His escape 1 i. 36, 18; 54, 6; 174, 9; vi. 20, 12; 45, 1; viii. 4, 7; 7, 18; 9, 14; 45, 27; x. 49, 8. In vii. 18, 6, Turvas4a is joined with Yaks2u, apparently a contemptuous variant of Yadu (Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261). Cf. Tr2tsu. may have been assisted by Indra, for in some passages 14) Rv. i. 174, 9; iv. 30, 17; v. 31, 8; viii. 4, 7. Indra's aid to Turvas4a (and) Yadu is referred to; it is also significant that the Anu, and apparently the Druhyu, kings are mentioned as having been drowned in the defeat, but not the Turvas4a and Yadu kings, and that Turvas4a appears in the eighth book of the Rigveda as a worshipper of Indra with the Anu prince, the successor, presumably, of the one who was drowned. 15) Hopkins, 265. Griffith, 16) Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 433, n. however, proposes to refer these passages to a defeat by Turvas4a and Yadu of Arn2a and Citraratha on the Sarayu; 17) The hymn is a late one, and the connexion of verse 18, where Arn2a and Citraratha are mentioned, is obscure. Cf. Hopkins. 259. but the evidence for this is quite inadequate. Two passages of the Rigveda 18) vi. 45, 1; ix. 61, 2 (where Divoda1sa is mentioned); vii. 19, 8 (where he appears as Atithigva). seem to refer to an attack by Turvas4a and Yadu on Divoda1sa, the father of Suda1s. It is reasonable to suppose that this was an attack of the two peoples on Divoda1sa, for there is some improbability of the references being to the Turvas4a, who was concerned in the attack on Suda1s, the son. Zimmer 19) Op. cit., 124. considers that the Turvas4as were also called Vr2ci1vants. This view is based on a hymn 20) vi. 27, 5-7. in which reference is made to the defeat of the Vr2ci1vants on the Yavya1vati1 and Hariyu1pi1ya1 in aid of Daivara1ta, and of Turvas4a in aid of Sr2n5jaya, the latter being elsewhere 21) iv. 15, 4. clearly the son of Devara1ta. But as this evidence for the identification of the Turvas4as with the Vr2ci1vants is not clear, it seems sufficient 22) Oldenberg, Buddha, 404, n. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. to assume that they were allies. Later, in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 23) xiii. 5, 4, 16. the Turvas4as appear as allies of the Pan5ca1las, Taurvas4a horses, thirty-three in number, and armed men, to the number of 6,000, being mentioned. 24) The sense is obscure. The St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it apparently as 6,033 horses (of armed warriors); Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 400, prefers to understand it as 33 horses and 6,000 men; Oldenberg, loc. cit., takes it as 6,033 warriors. Harisva1min's Commentary, cited by Eggeling, is obscure. But otherwise the name disappears: this lends probability to Oldenberge's conjecture 25) Buddha, 404. that the Turvas4as became merged in the Pan5ca1la people. Hopkins 26) Op. cit., 258, n. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 220. considers that in the S4atapatha passage the horses were merely named from the family of Turvas4a; but this view is less likely, since it ignores the difficulty involved in the reference to the men. It is impossible to be certain regarding the home of the Turvas4as at the time of their conflict with Suda1s. They apparently crossed the Parus2n2i1, 27) Rv. vii. 18. but from which side is disputed. The view of Pischel 28) Vedische Studien, 2, 218, Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. and Geldner, 29) Vedische Studien, 3, 152. If in Rv. viii. 20, 24, 1 rvas4a is read with Ludwig for tu1rvath hey are connected with the Sindhu. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 167; Muir, Sanskrit Text, 5, 286; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 354 et seq. that they advanced from the west towards the east, where the Bharatas were (see Kuru), is the more probable.

तुर्वीति
तुर्वीति
 is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, both in association with Vayya 1) i. 54, 6; ii. 13, 12; iv. 19, 6. and alone. 2) Rv. i. 36, 18; 61, 11; 112, 23. In three passages 3) i. 61, 11; ii. 13, 12; iv. 19, 6. reference is made to Indra aiding him over a flood. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147; 4, 254. Cf. Turvas1a, and Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 358; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 42, 36. has conjectured that he was king of the Turvas4as and Yadus. But there is no sufficient evidence for this view, though presumably he was of the Turvas4a tribe.

तुला
तुला,
 ‘scales,’ is mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 1) xxx. 17. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xi. 2, 7, 33. also speaks of the balance in connexion with the weighing of a man's good and evil deeds in the next and in this world. This differs very considerably from the later balance 3) Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 145. ordeal, in which a man was weighed twice, and was pronounced guilty or innocent according as, on the second occasion, he was more or less heavy than on the first. It is not possible to read the later practice into the earlier. 4) Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 21; 2, 363, quotes Schlagintweit as giving this passage as an example of the balance ordeal. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 45, n. 4.

तुष
तुष,
 in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 6, 16; xi. 1, 12, 29; 3, 5; xii. 3, 19. and later, 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 5, 5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 9, etc. regularly denotes the ‘husk’ of grain, often used for a fire. 3) Tus2a-pakva, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 4, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 2, 1, 7.

तूणव
तूणव
 denotes in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Samhita1, vi. 1, 4, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 6, 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 4; xxxiv. 5 (Indische Studien, 3, 477). and the Bra1hman2as 2) Pan5cavims4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 5, 13; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 13, 1; 15, 1; Nirukta, xiii. 9. a musical instrument of wood, probably the ‘flute.’ A ‘fluteblower’ is enumerated among the victims of the Purus2amedha, or ‘human sacrifice.’ 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 19, 20; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289.

तूतुजि
तूतुजि
 See Tuji.

तूपर
तूपर,
 ‘hornless,’ is a frequent description of animals intended for the sacrifice, especially of the goat, in the Atharvaveda and later. 1) Av. xi. 9, 22; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 1, 4, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 1, 15; xxix. 59, etc.; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 3, 7, etc.

तूर्घ्न
तूर्घ्न
 is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yak (v. 1) as the northern part of Kuruks2etra. 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78. Its exact position, however, cannot be ascertained.

तूर्णाश
तूर्णाश,
 in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 32, 4. Cf. Nirukta, v. 16. seems to denote a ‘mountain torrent.’ 

तूर्वयाण
तूर्वयाण
 is the name of a prince mentioned in the Rigveda. He appears by name in two passages, 1) i. 53, 10; vi. 18, 13. and is clearly alluded to in a third, 2) ii. 14, 7 (as a comparison of the two preceding passages shows); perhaps also viii. 53, 2. In i. 174, 3, Tu1rvaya1n2a seems also to be a proper name, though Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., here regards the word as an adjective. as an enemy of Atithigva, A1yu, and Kutsa. With this accords the fact that the Pakthas were opposed in the battle of the ten kings to the Tr2tsus, 3) vii. 18. and that Tu1rvaya1n2a  is shown by another passage of the Rigveda 4) x. 61, 1 et seq.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 71-77. to have been a prince of the Pakthas. He is there represented as having been a prote4ge4 of Indra, who aided him against Cyava1na and his guardians, the Maruts. It is not probable that he is identical with Sus4ravas. 5) Mentioned in i. 53, 9. 10. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 75, n.

तूष
तूष
 is found in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 1, 1; ii. 4, 9, 1; vi. 1, 1, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 1, 8; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 1, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262. denoting the ‘fringe’ or ‘trimming’ of a garment.

तृक्षि
तृक्षि
 is, in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 22, 7. the name of a prince who was a Tra1sadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu.’ He also appears with the Druhyu and the Pu1ru peoples in another hymn. 2) vi. 46, 8. It is not certain that the two persons are identical (cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic, 1, 113, notes 3, 4), but it is probable. It has been conjectured, but it is not probable, that the steed Ta1rks2ya (as ‘belonging to Tr2ks2i’) was his. 3) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 149.

तृण
तृण,
 ‘grass,’ is often mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 1; 162, 8, 11; x. 102, 10, etc. and later. 2) Av. ii. 30, 1; vi. 54, 1, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 22; viii. 24, etc. It was used as straw to roof in a house or hut. 3) Av. iii. 12, 5; ix. 3, 4, 7. 

तृणजलायुक
तृण-जलायुक,
 ‘caterpillar,’ is mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (iv. 2, 4).

तृणस्कन्द
तृण-स्कन्द
 occurs once in the Rigveda 1) i. 172, 3. as the name of a prince, his subjects (vis4ah2) being referred to. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 159, takes vis4ah2 as ‘cantons,’ but see Vis4. The word may originally have meant ‘grasshopper.’ 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

तृतीयक
तृतीयक,
 ‘the tertian (fever),’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda (i. 25, 4; v. 22, 13; xix. 39, 10). See Takman.

तृत्सु
तृत्सु
 occurs in the Rigveda, once in the singular 1) vii. 18, 13. and several times in the plural, 2) vii. 18, 7. 15. 19; 33, 5. 6; 83, 4. 6. 8. as a proper name. The Tr2tsus were clearly helpers of Suda1s in the great battle against the ten kings, S4imyu, the Turvas4a, the Druhyu, Kavas2a, the Pu1ru, the Anu, Bheda, S4ambara, the two Vaikarn2as, and perhaps the Yadu, who led with them as allies 3) They were regarded as enemies of the kings by Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95, and by Zimmer, op. cit., 126, The latter, however, altered his view (see pp. 430, 431, which Hopkins, op. cit., 260, has overlooked), and there is no doubt that the later opinion is correct. Cf. also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173; Hopkins, 260, 261. Of these tribes the Pakthas, Alinas, Bhala1nas, Vis2a1n2ins, and S4ivas, were probably settled in the north-west, to the west of the Indus, and around the Kabul River. The Anus, Pu1rus, Turvas4as, Yadus, and Druhyus, were probably tribes of the Panjab; the Ajas, S4igrus, and Yaks2us, tribes of the east, under Bheda; S4ambara may also have been a native of the east; S4imyu and Kavas2a are doubtful; and the Vaikarn2au probably belonged to the north-west. the Matsyas, Pakthas, Bhala1nas, Alinas, Vis2a1n2ins, S4ivas, Ajas, S4igrus, and perhaps Yaks2us. 4) This is uncertain; the text of the Rigveda, vii. 18, 6, has Yaks2u, and the same word recurs in verse 19. On the other hand, the word Yadu would naturally be expected in verse 6, as Turvas4a is mentioned. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 122, says that Yadu occurs in vii. 18, but on p. 126 he cites Yaks2u in both places, evidently by oversight. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261, n., considers that Turvas4a, the Yaks2u, is a sarcastic expression, instead of Turvas4a, the Yadu, making Turvas4a, whom he regards as king of the Yadus, ridiculous as a member of an insignificant people, and alluding to him also as a sacrificial victim (as it were, yas2t2avya, ‘to be offered’; of purod2a1s4, ‘cake of sacrifice,’ in verse 6, as a pun on puroga1s, ‘leader’). Whether Yaks2u is used contemptuously for Yadu or not, it seems hard not to believe that the Yadus are referred to. The defeat of the ten kings is celebrated in one hymn of the Rigveda, 5) vii. 18. and is evidently alluded to in two others. 6) vii. 33 and 83. The great battle took place on the Parus2n2i1, but there was also a fight on the Yamuna1 with Bheda, the Ajas, S4igrus, and Yaks2us. As the Yamuna1 and the Parusn2i1 represent opposite ends of the territory of the Tr2tsus (for we cannot with Hopkins 7) India, Old and New, 52. No such conjecture was made by him in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 259 et seq. safely identify the streams), it is difficult to see exactly how the ten kings could be confederated, but it should be noted that the references to the ten kings occur in the two later hymns, 6) vii. 33 and 83. and not in the hymn 5) vii. 18. describing the battle itself; besides, absolute numerical accuracy cannot be insisted upon. It is difficult exactly to determine the character of the Tr2tsus; especially in their relation to the Bharatas, who under Vis4va1mitra's guidance are represented as prospering and as advancing to the Vipa1s4 and S4utudri1. 8) Rv. iii. 33; 53, 9-12. Roth ingeniously brought this into connexion with the defeat of his enemies by Suda1s, which is celebrated in the seventh book of the Rigveda--a book attributed to the Vasis2t2ha family--and thought that there was a reference in one verse 9) vii. 33, 6. See Roth, op. cit., 90, 121: Muir. Sanskrit Texts, 12, 320; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 154, 155; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur and Cultur, 35, 36; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 110, 111; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society. 16, 41. to the defeat of the Bharatas by Suda1s. But it seems certain that the verse is mistranslated, and that the Bharatas are really represented as victors with Suda1s. 10) Oldenberg, Buddha, 406: Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 34. Ludwig 11) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 175. accordingly identifies the Tr2tsus and the Bharatas. Oldenberg, 12) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 207. Cf. Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 362. after accepting this view at first, 13) Buddha, 405, 406. later expressed the opinion that the Tr2tsus were the priests of the Bharata people, and therefore identical with the Vasis2t2has. This view is supported by the fact that in one passage 14) Rv. vii. 33, 1 (s4vityan5co daks2in2ataskaparainah2). the Tr2tsus are clearly described as wearing their hair in the peculiar manner affected by the Vasis2t2has, 15) Rv. vii. 83. (s4vityan5co daks2in2ataskaparainah2). and would in that passage thus seem to represent the Vasis2t2has. But Geldner 16) Vedische Studien, 2, 136; R2gvedaGlossar, 74. has suggested with great probability that Tr2tsu, who is once mentioned in the singular, 17) Rv. vii. 18, 13. means the Tr2tsu king--that is, Suda1s. 18) Cf. Rv. vii. 18, 24. The parallelism of verses 13 and 24 is quite beyond question. Moreover, the praise of Suda1s and of the Bharatas is found coupled in Rv. iii. 53, 9. 12. 24, and in Rv. vi. 16, 4, 5, Divoda1sa is coupled with the Bharatas in such a way as to suggest irresistibly that Divoda1sa was a Bharata. This explanation alone justifies the description 19) Rv. vii. 33, 6. of the Bharatas as Tr2tsu1na1m2 vis4ah2, 20) That this is the sense of vis4ah2 is almost certain. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, loc. cit. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 159, and Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 111, render it ‘cantons,’ but see Vi1s4. ‘subjects of the Tr2tsus,’ meaning the Tr2tsu Gotra or family, for the people could not be said to be subjects of a body of priests. The Vasis2t2has might be called Tr2tsus because of their close connexion with the royal house of that people. The reverse process is also quite possible, but is rendered improbable by the fact that the Pratr2dah2 are referred to as receiving Vasis2t2ha. 21) Rv. vii. 33, 14. Geldner (op. cit., 138, 139) ingeniously suggests that Vasis2t2ha, being miraculously born, needed a Gotra, and so became a Tr2tsu. This name of the Tr2tsu dynasty is probably older than its connexion with Vasis2t2ha in the time of Suda1s, a conclusion supported by the name of Pratardana, who is mentioned later as a descendant of Divoda1sa, 22) Pratardana is mentioned in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxvi. 5, as Daivoda1si, ‘descendant of Divoda1sa.’ an ancestor of Suda1s. The Tr2tsu dynasty could therefore hardly have been referred to as Vasis2t2has. For the further history of the dynasty and its relation with Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra, see Suda1s. If the Tr2tsus and their subjects, the Bharatas, were in the Rigvedic period at war with the tribes on either side of the territory between the Parus2n2i1 and the Yamuna1, it is clear 23) Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 406 et seq., and see Kuru. that later on they coalesced with the Pu1rus and probably others of those tribes to form the Kuru people. Already in the Rigveda 24) See Rv. vi. 47, where Divoda1sa and Sa1rn5jaya are both praised. In vi. 27, 5, the Turvas4as are opposed to the Sr2n5jayas, and in vii. 18, 6; 19, 8, the Tr2tsus are opposed to the Turvas4as. the Tr2tsus are allied with the Sr2n5jayas, and in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 25) ii. 4, 4, 5. one Purohita serves both Kurus and Sr2n5jayas. Hillebrandt 26) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 98 et seq. considers that the Tr2tsus cannot be identified with the Bharatas, but that Suda1s and the Bharatas represent an invading body, which, however, became allied with the Tr2tsus and the Vasis2t2ha priests. He also thinks that the Rigveda reveals a time when Divoda1sa, the grandfather or ancestor of Suda1s, was living in Arachosia, on the Sarasvati1, and warring against the Pan2is, whom he identifies with the Parnians. But this conjecture 27) Cf. also Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 837 et seq. cannot be regarded as probable. In the Sarasvati1 28) Rv. vi. 61, 3. Brunnhofer, Iran und Turan, 127, identifies this river with the Oxus, but Hillebrandt identifies it with the Haraqaiti. it is not necessary to see any other river than the later Sarasvati1, in the middle country, which flowed within the boundaries of the Tr2tsus: it is also significant that there are references 29) Rv. ix. 61, 2. Cf. vi. 45, 1; Zimmer, op. cit., 124. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 424. to contests between Turvas4a Yadu and Atithigva or Divoda1sa. Thus there is no reason to doubt that Divoda1sa and the Bharatas were in the middle country, and not in Iran.

तृष्ट
तृष्ट
 is mentioned in the Maitra1yan2i1 1) iv. 8, 1. The reading is uncertain; it may be Tr2s2t2ha1-varutri1. See von Schroeder's edition, p. 106, n. and Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1s 2) xxx. 1, where again the reading is uncertain. The Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1, xlvi. 4, has Tvas2t2a1-varutri1 (von Schroeder's edition of the Ka1t2haka, 2, 181, n.). Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 190, 191; Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 119. as being along with Varutri the priest of the Asuras.

तृष्टामा
तृष्टामा
 is mentioned as a stream in the Nadi1-stuti, or ‘praise of rivers,’ in the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14. There seems to be no means of identifying it.

तेजन
तेजन
 denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 110, 5. a rod or staff of reed used for measuring a field. In the Atharvaveda the sense of ‘bamboo’ is found twice, 2) i. 2, 4; xx. 136, 3 (= Khila, v. 22, 3). Cf. taijana as an adjective in Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxi. 10. the bamboo being specified in the second passage as ‘of the spring’ (va1santika); more particularly it denotes the shaft of an arrow, 3) Av. vi. 49, 1 (Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 317); is2u eka-tejana1, ‘an arrow with one shaft,’ vi. 57, 1. a sense often found in later Vedic texts. 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 25; iii. 26; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 1 (with s4r2n3ga and s4alya as the three parts of an arrow; in Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 8, 1, kulmala takes the place of tejana; cf. ibid., 2). The Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 3, 3, 1, has ani1ka, s4alya, and tejana. Cf. Is2u.

तेजनी
तेजनी
 denotes in the later Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as a bundle of reeds, 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 8, 3, 12; perhaps Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 9. and in some cases such a bundle twisted into a rope, 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxii. 13; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 11, as rendered by Sa1yan2a. for the two ends of the Tejani1 are mentioned.

तेजस्
तेजस्
 is regarded by Schrader 1) Prehistoric Antiquities, 221. as having in the Rigveda 2) Cf. vi. 3, 5; 8, 5; 15, 19. the specific sense of ‘axe.’ But in all the passages the sense of the ‘bolt’ of the god is adequate.

तैत्तिरीय
तैत्तिरीय
 is the name of one of the divisions of the Black Yajurveda, which is, however, not found thus described until the Su1tra period. 1) Anupada Su1tra, ii. 6; vii. 7. 10, etc. See Weber Indian Literature, 87 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 175 et seq.; von Schroeder, Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 1, x et seq. The school is represented by a Sam2hita1, 2) Edited by Weber, Indische Studien, xi, xii, and in the Bibliotheca Indica, 1854-1899. a Bra1hman2a, 3) Edited in the Bibliotheca Indica, 1855-1870, and in the A1nanda1s4rama Series, 1898. and an A1ran2yaka, 4) Edited in the Bibliotheca Indica, 18641872, and in the A1nanda1s4rama Series, 1898. besides an Upanis2ad, 5) Edited by Roer, 1850, and in the A1nanda1s4rama Series, 1889. which forms a part of the A1ran2yaka.

तैमात
तैमात
 is twice mentioned as a species of snake in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 13, 6; 18, 4. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 243; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 425; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95. 

तैल
तैल,
 ‘sesamum oil,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 7, 2 (all the manuscripts have taula, which must be wrong; the Paippala1da MS has tu1la: see Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 7). where 2) xx. 136, 16. reference is made to keeping such oil in jars. In the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 3) xi. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben. 240, 241. reference is made to anointing with sesamum oil.

तोक
तोक
 denotes ‘children’ or ‘descendants’ generally in the Rigveda 1) i. 43, 2; ii. 2, 11; 9, 2; vii. 62, 6; viii. 5, 20; 67, 11, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 13, 2; 28, 3; v. 19, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvi. 7 (Indische Studien, 3, 466); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 5, 2, 39, etc. The word is often joined with Tanaya. 3) Rv. i. 31, 12; 64, 14; 114, 6; 147, 1; ii. 33, 14; v. 53, 13; vi. 1, 12, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7.

तोक्मन्
तोक्मन्,
 neut., denotes in the Rigveda 1) x. 62, 8. and later 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 13, 81; xxi. 30. 42; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 11; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 5, etc. the green shoots of any kind of grain. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 3) viii. 16. Cf. for its use at the Sautra1man2i1, Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 160. reference is made to the shoots of rice (vri1hi), large rice (maha1vri1hi), panic seed (priyan3gu), and barley (yava).

तोत्त्र
तोत्त्र,
 a ‘goad’ for driving cattle, is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xii. 4, 1, 10).

तोद
तोद
 appears once to denote a ‘goad’ in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 16, 11; Mantra in Kaus4ika Su1tra, 107. but more often 2) Rv. vi. 6, 6; 12, 1, 3, are probably so to be understood. it is an agent noun meaning ‘impeller.’ Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 3, 74. considers that in one passage 4) Rv. i. 150, 1. the sense is ‘wielder of the rod of punishment’ (later dan2d2a-dhara)--that is, ‘prince.’ 

तौग्र्य
तौग्र्य,
 ‘descendant of Tugra,’ is the patronymic of Bhujyu in the Rigveda. 1) i. 117, 16; 118, 6; 182, 5. 6; viii. 5, 22; x. 39, 4.

तौदी
तौदी
 in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) x. 4, 24. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 578, leaves the word untranslated. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 608, suggests that it is a fanciful name, ‘the piercer,’ since it is associated with ghr2ta1ci1, ‘dripping with ghee,’ which is clearly such a word. appears to denote a plant.

तौर्वश
तौर्वश
 See Turvas4a.

तौल
तौल,
 the reading of the text of the Atharvaveda (i. 7, 2), and a form which is otherwise unknown and cannot be satisfactorily explained, must doubtless be meant for Taila.

तौविलिका
तौविलिका,
 occurring once in a hymn of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 16, 3. is a word of quite uncertain sense. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks it means some kind of beast; Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 72. and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292. regard it as a sort of plant; Sa1yan2a explains it as a disease-causing demon, while Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 30, 466. leaves the sense doubtful.

त्रपु
त्रपु
 denotes ‘tin’ in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 3, 8. and later. 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xviii. 10; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 11, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 13 (all in enumerations of metals); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 12, 6, 5; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 17, 3; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 17, 7. In Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 7, 5, 1, the form is trapus. Its quality of being easily smelted, which Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 53. thinks is indicated by the name (as derived from the root trap, ‘be ashamed’), is clearly alluded to in the Atharvaveda passage. 

त्रसदस्यु
त्रस-दस्यु,
 son of Purukutsa, 1) Rv. v. 33, 8; vii. 19, 3; viii. 19, 36; iv. 42, 8 et seq. is mentioned in the Rigveda as king of the Pu1rus. 2) Rv. iv. 38, 1 et seq.; vii. 19, 3. He is merely alluded to in i. 63, 7; 112, 4; viii. 8, 21; 36, 7; 37, 7; 49, 10. He was born to Purukutsa by his wife, Purukutsa1ni1, at a time of great distress; 3) Rv. iv. 42, 8 et seq. this, according to Sa1yan2a, refers to Purukutsa's captivity: possibly his death is really meant. Trasadasyu was also a descendant of Giriks2it, 4) Rv. v. 33, 8. and Purukutsa was a descendant of Durgaha. The genealogy, therefore, appears to be: Durgaha, Giriks2it, Purukutsa, Trasadasyu. Trasadasyu was the ancestor of Tr2ks2i, 5) Rv. viii. 22, 7. He was a Pu1ru king. See vi. 46, 8. and, according to Ludwig, 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155, with reference to Rv. v. 33, 7 et seq. had a son Hiran2in. Trasadasyu's chronological position is determined by the fact that his father, Purukutsa, was a contemporary of Suda1s, either as an opponent 7) So Ludwig, 3, 174, who alters Suda1sam to Suda1se, in support of this view, in Rv. i. 63, 7. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 204, 205, 219, R2gvedaNoten, 1, 63; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 153; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 112, n. 1. Foy, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 34, 242, denies that the word in this passage is a proper name at all. or as a friend. 8) Cf. Hillebrandt, loc. cit. That Purukutsa was an enemy of Suda1s is more probable, because the latter's predecessor, Divoda1sa, was apparently 9) Rv. i. 130, 7; Ludwig, 3, 114; but see Hillebrandt, 1, 113, 114. at enmity with the Pu1rus, and in the battle of the ten kings Pu1rus were ranged against Suda1s and the Tr2tsus. Trasadasyu himself seems to have been an energetic king. His people, the Pu1rus, were settled on the Sarasvati1, 10) Rv. vii. 95, 96; Ludwig, 3, 175; Hillebrandt, 1, 115. which was, no doubt, the stream in the middle country, that locality according well with the later union of the Pu1rus with the Kuru people, who inhabited that country. This union is exemplified in the person of Kurus4ravan2a, who is called Tra1sadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ in the Rigveda, 11) x. 33, 4. Cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 150, 184. whose father was Mitra1tithi, and whose son was Upamas4ravas. The relation of Mitra1tithi to Tr2ks2i does not appear. Another descendant of Trasadasyu was Tryarun2a Traivr2s2n2a, who is simply called Trasadasyu in a hymn of the Rigveda. 12) v. 27. He was not only a ‘descendant of Trivr2s2an,’ but, according to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 13) xiii. 3, 12. The Ta1n2d2aka, cited by Sa1yan2a (Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 67), has Trasadasyu, like the Rv. he was also Traidha1tva, ‘descendant of Tridha1tu.’ The order of these two predecessors of Tryarun2a cannot be determined in any way from Vedic literature. According to the later tradition, 14) Harivam2s4a, 714 et seq., where the name (716) is also misread as Tridharman. Traidha1tva cannot reasonably be taken as representing a patronymic from Tridhanvan, as Sieg, op. cit., 7476, seems to do. Trivr2s2an has entirely disappeared from the Epic tradition; there is thus no way of assigning a relative priority to either Trivr2s2an or Tridhanvan. a prince named Tridhanvan preceded Tryarun2a in the succession. Vedic tradition further fails to show in what precise relation Trasadasyu stood to Trivr2s2an or Tryarun2a. Trasdasyu Paurukutsa appears in several Bra1hman2as 15) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 16; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxii. 3 (Indische Studien, 3, 473); Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 5, 3. as a famous sacrificer of ancient times, together with Para A1t2n2a1ra, Vi1tahavya S4ra1yasa, and Kaks2i1vant Aus4ija, who in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 16) ii. 6, 11. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 217 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 111-116; 2, 165, n. 4; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 25; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386. are called ‘ancient great kings’ (pu1rve maha1ra1ja1h2).

त्रातऐषुमत
त्रात ऐषुमत
 (‘descendant of Is2umant’) is mentioned in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) i. 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 372. as a pupil of Nigad2a Pa1rn2avalki.

त्रायमाणा
त्रायमाणा
 denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 2, 6. a plant of an unknown species. The word is possibly only an epithet, retaining its participial sense of ‘preserving,’ though this interpretation is not favoured by the accent. 2) Tra1yama1n2a1. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 477.

त्रासदस्यव
त्रासदस्यव,
 ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ is the patronymic in the Rigveda of Tr2ks2i 1) viii. 22, 7. and of Kurus4ravan2a. 2) x. 33, 4. The word is also applied to Agni as ‘protector of, or worshipped by, Trasadasyu’ and his line. 3) viii. 19, 32; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 96.

त्रिककुद्
त्रि-ककुद्

From it came the salve (A1n5jana), 3) Hence called Traikakuda, Av. iv. 9, 9, 10; xix. 44, 6, etc. which tradition made out to be derived from Vr2tra's eye. 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, loc. cit.; Maitra1yan2i1 and Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1s, loc. cit. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 5, 29, 30; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 239, n. 4; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 381.

त्रिकद्रुक
त्रि-कद्रुक,
 a term used in the plural only, appears to denote three vessels of some kind for holding Soma. ^1 i. 32, 3; ii. 11, 17; 15, 1; 22, 1; x. 14, 16.

त्रिखर्व
त्रि-खर्व
 is the name of a school of priests mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (ii. 8, 3) as practising a special rite with success.

त्रित
त्रित
 is clearly a god 1) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 67-69. in Vedic literature, but Ya1ska in one passage of the Nirukta 2) iv. 6. already explains the name as that of a R2s2i or seer.

त्रिपुर
त्रि-पुर,
 ‘a threefold stronghold,’ is alluded to in the Bra1hman2as 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 3, 3, 25; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 11; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a in Indische Studien, 2, 310. See also Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiv. 10, etc., and Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 46, n 1. as a secure protection. But as the passages are mythical no stress can be laid on them as evidence for the existence of forts with three concentric walls. 

त्रिप्लक्ष
त्रि-प्लक्ष,
 masc. plur., ‘the three fig-trees,’ is the name of the place where the Dr2s2advati1 disappeared, near the Yamuna1, according to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 13, 4. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiii. 29, 33; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 19, 9; Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, xxiv. 6, 39.

त्रियवि
त्रिय्-अवि
 See Tryavi.

त्रियुग
त्रि-युग,
 neut., is an expression occurring in the Rigveda 1) x. 97, 1 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 6, 1, and Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1; xii. 75. where it is said that the plants (os2adhi) were born ‘three ages’ before the gods (devebhyas triyugam2 pura1). The commentator on the Nirukta 2) ix. 28. thinks that the ages here meant are the Yugas of the later Indian chronology, the sense of the passage being that the plants were born in the first Yuga. The author of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) vii. 2, 4, 26. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 340. understands three seasons--spring, the rains, and autumn--to be meant in the verse, taking the two words triyugam2 pura1 separately as ‘formerly, in the three seasons.’ The vague sense ‘three ages’ is quite adequate: the use of ‘three’ in such cases is a favourite feature in folklore. Cf. Yuga.

त्रिवत्स
त्रि-वत्स,
 ‘three years old,’ 1) As regards the form and meaning of this compound, cf. Tryavi. is an expression applied to cattle in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 10; xviii. 26; xxviii. 27; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 13; xviii. 9; xxi. 14, etc. Cf. La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 3, 9 et seq., where one explanation of the word is tri-vars2a.

त्रिवृत्
त्रि-वृत्,
 ‘threefold,’ is the designation of an amulet in the Atharvaveda (v. 28, 2. 4).

त्रिवेदकृष्णरातलौहित्य
त्रि-वेद कृष्ण-रात लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of S4ya1majayanta Lauhitya, according to a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 42, 1). 

त्रिशङ्कु
त्रि-शङ्कु
 is in Vedic literature the name of a sage mentioned as a teacher in the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad. 1) i. 10, 1. There is no trace of the later legend by which he becomes the victim of Vasis2t2ha's curse and the object of Vis4va1mitra's solicitude, being eventually fixed in the sky as a constellation. 2) See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 362, 375 et seq. The confusion of the chronology in the tales of Tris4an3ku is a good example of the worthlessness of the supposed epic tradition.

त्रिशोक
त्रि-शोक
 is the name of an ancient mythical seer who is mentioned both in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 13; viii. 45, 30. In x. 29, 2, the word seems merely to be an adjective, meaning ‘with triple splendour.’ and the Atharvaveda. 2) iv. 29, 6. A Sa1man, or chant, named after him is referred to in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) viii. 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107, 162; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 33.

त्रैककुद
त्रै-ककुद
 See Trikakud.

त्रैतन
त्रैतन
 appears in the Rigveda 1) i. 158, 5. as a Da1sa, an enemy of Di1rghatamas, who seems to have engaged him in single combat and defeated him. The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that he is rather a supernatural being allied to Trita (cf. the Avestan Thrita and Thraetaona). 2) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 68. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 151; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 144.

त्रैधात्व
त्रै-धात्व
 (‘descendant of Tridha1tu,’) is the patronymic of Tryarun2a in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiii. 3, 12).

त्रैपद
त्रै-पद,
 neut., occurs as a measure of distance, ‘threequarters’ of a Yojana, in the Pan5ca1vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, where half a Yojana is termed Gavyu1ti and a quarter Kros4a. 1) xvi. 13. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiv. 41, 12. 

त्रैवणि
त्रैवणि
 is mentioned as a pupil of Aupacandhani or Aupajandhani in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) ii. 6, 3 (Ka1n2va = ii. 5, 21 Ma1dhyam2dina); iv. 6, 3 (= iv. 5, 27). In the Ma1dhyam2dina recension 2) iv. 5, 27. his name occurs twice in the second Vam2s4a, in both cases as a pupil of Aupajandhani.

त्रैवृष्ण
त्रै-वृष्ण,
 ‘descendant of Trivr2s2an,’ is the patronymic of Trayarun2a in the Rigveda (v. 27, 1).

त्र्यरुणत्रैवृष्णत्रसदस्यु
त्र्य्-अरुण त्रै-वृष्ण त्रसदस्यु
 is the name of a prince whose generosity to a singer is celebrated in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) v. 27, 1-3. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 3, 12. Cf. the Ta1n2d2aka recension, cited in Sa1yan2a, on Rv. v. 2, where Trasadasyu is given as the king's name. he appears as Tryarun2a Traidha1tva Aiks2va1ka, and is the hero of the following story. He was out in his chariot with his Purohita, or domestic priest, Vr2s4a Ja1na, and by excessive speed in driving killed a Brahmin boy. This sin was atoned for by the Purohita's using his Va1rs4a Sa1man (chant). The S4a1t2ya1yana Bra1hman2a, cited by Sa1yan2a, 3) On Rv., loc. cit. See also the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a version in Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 20. elaborates the tale. As Vr2s4a had held the reins, king and priest accused each other of the murder. The Iks2va1kus being consulted threw the responsibility for the crime on Vr2s4a, who thereupon revived the boy by the Va1rs4a Sa1man. In consequence of this unfairness of theirs--being Ks2atriyas they were partial to a Ks2atriya--Agni's glow ceased to burn in their houses. In response to their appeal to restore it, Vr2s4a came to them, saw the Pis4a1ci1 (demoness), who, in the form of Trasadasyu's wife, had stolen the glow, and succeeded in restoring it to Agni. This version with some variations occurs also in the Br2haddevata1, 4) v. 14 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. which connects the story with a hymn of the Rigveda. 5) v. 2. Sieg's attempt 6) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 64-76. Cf. Geldner, Festtgruss an Roth, 192. to show that the hymn really refers to this tale is not at all successful. 7) See Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 366 et seq.; R2gveda-Noten, 1, 312; Hillebrandt, Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1903, 240 et seq. It is clear that Trasadasyu must here mean ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ and not King Trasadasyu himself. The difference of the patronymics, Traivr2s2n2a and Traidha1tva, by which he is referred to can best be explained by assuming that there were two kings, Trivr2s2an and Tridha1tu (or possibly Tridhanvan), from whom Tryarun2a was descended. 8) See Sieg, op. cit., 74-76, and Trasadasyu. The connexion with the Iks2va1kus is important (see Iks2va1ku).

त्र्यवि
त्र्य्-अवि
 designates a calf eighteen months old 1) The etymological meaning is apparently ‘having three sheep (periods)’ -that is, ‘having periods of thrice six months,’ just as the adjective pan5ca1vi means ‘having five periods of six months,’ or ‘thirty months old.’ in the Rigveda 2) iii. 55, 14. and later Sam2hita1s. 3) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 2; xviii. 12, etc. (in the form triyavi); Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 10; xviii. 26, etc.

त्र्याशिर्
त्र्य्-आशिर्,
 ‘with three admixtures,’ is an epithet of Soma in the Rigveda. 1) v. 27, 5. Cf. perhaps viii. 2, 7 (traya Indrasya soma1h2 suta1sah2, ‘three kinds of Soma pressed for Indra’). According to Sa1yan2a this means mixed with curds (Dadhi), meal (Saktu), and milk (Payas). More accurately it would seem 2) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic, 1, 209; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 422. to denote the milk (gava1s4ir), the barley (yava1s4ir), and the curds (dadhya1s4ir), which were used to mix with the Soma.

त्वच्
त्वच्,
 ‘skin,’ ‘hide,’ (a) denotes specially in the Rigveda 1) i. 79, 3; iii. 21, 5; ix. 65, 25; 66, 29; 70, 7; 79, 4; 101, 11, 16, etc. the hide used in the process of extracting the Soma juice from the plant. The Soma was pounded with stones (adri) upon the skin laid on the pressing boards (adhis2avan2e phalake), 2) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic, 1, 181-183, and Adhisavan2a. which, however, are not mentioned in the Rigveda. Or if a pestle and mortar were used, the skin was still placed underneath them to catch the drops of juice, not above, as Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 110. thought. (b) Tvac also denotes the rind of the Soma plant that remains after the juice has been extracted. 4) Rv. ix. 86, 44; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, 13, 1; Hillebrandt, op. cit., 52. (c) Metaphorically the term kr2s2n2a1 tvac, ‘the black skins,’ is applied to the aboriginal enemies of the invading A1ryans. 5) Rv. i. 130, 8, and probably ix. 41, 1, for which, however, cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., 51, n. 2, and see Da1sa.

त्वष्टृ
त्वष्टृ
 is employed once in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 3, 33. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 688; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 651. to denote a ‘carpenter,’ with a deliberate play on the name of the god Tvas2t2r2. He is there mentioned as using an axe (svadhiti) to fashion (from wood) ‘a well-made form’ (ru1pam2 sukr2tam). See Tas2t2r2.

त्वाष्ट्र
त्वाष्ट्र,
 ‘descendant of Tvas2t2r2,’ is the patronymic, in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 1) ii. 6, 3 (Ka1n2va = ii. 5, 22 Ma1dhyam2dina); iv. 6, 3 (= iv. 5, 28). of the mythical teacher A1bhu1ti.

त्सरु
त्सरु,
 --(a) This word seems to denote some sort of crawling animal in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) vii. 50, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. (b) In the later literature the word means a ‘handle,’ as of a beaker (Camasa). 1) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 4. Cf. La1t2ya1yana Srauta Su1tra, x. 12, 12, etc. In this sense also it seems to occur in the description of the plough (La1n3gala) in the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 17, 3, where the ordinary text has soma-satsaru (so the Pada text), and the Paippala1da recension has somapitsalam. and the later Sam2hita1s. 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 5, 6, has sumati-tsaru; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 12; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 71; Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, ii. 34, have somapitsaru, which Vasis2t2ha renders as ‘provided with a handle for the drinker of Soma’ (i.e., somapi-tsaru). Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 255, suggests soma-sa-tsaru, ‘with (sa-) strap (uman, a conjectural word) and handle’ (tsaru). Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 116, prefers to read throughout sumati-tsaru, ‘with well-smoothed handle,’ from the root seen in mati1-kr2, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 13. 

त्सारिन्
त्सारिन्
 denotes, in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 134, 5. a ‘hunter’ engaged in the chase of the takva (an unknown beast), according to Ludwig and Max Mu7ller. 2) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 448. But this explanation is quite conjectural. D.

दंश
दंश
 (lit., ‘biter’), ‘gad-fly,’ is mentioned in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (vi. 9, 3; 10, 2).

दंष्ट्र
दंष्ट्र,
 denoting a prominent tooth, ‘tusk,’ or ‘fang’ of an animal, occurs often from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. ii. 13, 4; x. 87, 3; Av. iv. 36, 2; x. 5, 43; xvi. 7, 3, etc.

दक्षकात्यायनिआत्रेय
दक्ष कात्यायनि आत्रेय
 (‘descendant of Atri’) is mentioned in the Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) of the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 41, 1; iv. 17, 1) as a pupil of S4an3kha Ba1bhravya.

दक्षजयन्तलौहित्य
दक्ष जयन्त लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Kr2s2n2ara1ta Lauhitya.

दक्षपार्वति
दक्ष पार्वति
 (‘descendant of Parvata’) is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 4, 4, 6. as having performed a certain rite which his descendants, the Da1ks2a1yan2as, still maintained, thus enjoying royal dignity down to the time of the Bra1hman2a itself. He appears in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 2) iv. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 223; 4, 358; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 374 et seq.; Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 138. also.

दक्षिणतस्कपर्द
दक्षिणतस्-कपर्द
 is an epithet of the Vasis2t2has in the Rigveda (vii. 33, 1) referring to their mode of ‘wearing the hair in a braid on the right side.’ See Kaparda. 

दक्षिणा
दक्षिणा
 appears repeatedly in the Rigveda 1) A whole hymn, Rv. x. 107, is devoted to its praise. Cf. i. 168, 7; vi. 27, 8; viii. 24, 29; 39, 5; x. 62, 1, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 11, 4; v. 7, 11; xi. 7, 9; 8, 22; xiii. 1, 52; xviii. 4, 8, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 7, 3, 1; 8, 1, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 19, 23; xix. 30; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 3, 3 et seq.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 9, 3, 1 et seq. The verses (ga1tha1 na1ra1s4am2si1, either as a single expression or as two separate terms) used to win these Daks2in2a1s were notoriously false. See Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiv. 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 2, 6. 7; Nirukta, i. 7; xi. 2. as the designation of the gift presented to priests at the sacrifice, apparently because a cow--a prolific (daks2in2a1) one--was the usual ‘fee’ 3) The transition of meaning is similar in the use of the English word ‘fee’; ‘cattle,’ ‘money,’ ‘payment for service’ (see Murray's English Dictionary, s.v. ‘fee’). Cf. also Go-da1na, n. 4. on such an occasion. 4) Cf. the rule that when nothing is specified a cow is the Daks2in2a1, Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 2, 13; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 1, 2. The later Da1na-stutis, or ‘Praises of Gifts,’ in the Rigveda immensely exaggerate these donations, and the exaggeration grows in the Bra1hman2as. It is important to notice that these enumerations of gifts in the main include nothing but articles of personal property, such as kine, horses, buffaloes, or camels (us2t2ra), ornaments, and so forth, but not land. 5) So, e.g., Rv. i. 126, 1-4; v. 30, 12-15; viii. 1, 32. 33; 3, 21 et seq.; 4, 19-21; 5, 37-39; 6, 46-48; 55; 56; vii. 18, 21-24, and the full list in Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 273-277. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 49 et seq. Clothes (va1sas) and gold are mentioned as a Daks2in2a1 in Av. ix. 5, 14. The four Daks2in2a1s, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 4, 7, are gold, a cow, clothes, and a horse. This is practically exhaustive if the trappings of the horse and ornaments are included. Reference is, however, made in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 6) xiii. 7, 1, 13, with which compare xiii. 6, 2, 18, where the Brahmin's land is excluded; and see xiii. 7, 1, 15, where the gift of land is disapproved. to land as a Daks2in2a1, but with disapproval, probably because the land came to be regarded as inalienable without the consent of the clansmen. 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 1, 1, 4. Cf. above, pp. 100, n. 19, 246; below, pp. 351, 352. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 169171; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 104, 105; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 96-98; Bloomfield, Religion of the Veda, 69-74; Atharvaveda, 76 et seq., 100, 121.

दक्षिणापथ
दक्षिणा-पथ
 (lit., ‘the road to the south’), ‘the south country,’ is found, probably as a designation of the Deccan, as early as the Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, 1) i. 1, 2, 13. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 394, n., and Baudha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, v. 13. coupled with Sura1s2t2ra. A similar expression is daks2in2a1 pada1, ‘with southward foot,’ in the Rigveda, 2) x. 61, 8. referring to the place where the exile (para1-vr2j) goes on being expelled. This no doubt simply means ‘the south’ beyond the limits of the recognized A1ryan world, which even as late as the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 3) ii. 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 185; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 408; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 30; Keith S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 28, n. 1; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 200. appears as bounded by the Vindhyas on the south.

दक्षिणाप्रष्टि
दक्षिणा-प्रष्टि
 denotes ‘the side horse on the right.’ It appears from two passages of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) v. 1, 4, 9; ix. 4, 2, 11 (this passage appears to speak of three horses only, but of. v. 4, 3, 17). Cf. also Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 13, 12. that there were at times four horses yoked to the chariot, the right and the left yoke horse (daks2in2a1-yugya, savya1-yugya) in the middle, flanked by one on each side, the two latter of course not being fastened to the yoke at all, but presumably by traces alongside of the yoke horses. See Ratha.

दक्षिणायन
दक्षिणायन
 See Su1rya.

दक्षिणायुग्य
दक्षिणा-युग्य,
 ‘the yoke horse on the right,’ is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (v. 1, 4, 6; 4, 3, 8; ix. 4, 2, 11). See Ratha.

दण्ड
दण्ड,
 ‘staff.’ (a) This word is often mentioned in the ordinary sense; for example, when used for driving cattle 1) Rv. vii. 33, 6. (go-ajana1sah2), or as a weapon. 2) Av. v. 5, 4. Cf. Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 35; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 4, 6, etc. A staff was given to a man on consecration for driving away demons, according to the Satapatha Bra1hman2a. 3) iii. 2, 1, 32. The staff also played a part in the initiation (upanayana) of a youth on attaining manhood. 4) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 19; 22; Sa1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, ii. 1, 6, 11, etc. In a modified sense the word is used to denote the handle of a ladle or similar implement. 5) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 4, 1, 36. Of a musical instrument, Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 9; S4rauta Su1tra, xvii. 3, 1 et seq. (b) The ‘staff’ as the symbol of temporal power, implying punishment, is applied by the king (ra1ja-pres2ito dan2d2ah2). 1) Pa1raskara Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 15. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 7, where the king, being himself ‘exempt from punishment’ (a-dan2d2ya), inflicts judicial punishment (dan2d2a-vadha). The king, in modern phraseology, was the source of criminal law; and he clearly retained this branch of law in his own hands even in later times. 2) Foy, Die ko7nigliche Gewalt, 21 et seq. The punishment of the non-guilty (a-dan2d2ya) is given as one of the characteristics of the nonBrahminical Vra1tyas in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) xvii. 1, 9; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 33. See also Dharma.

दण्डऔपर
दण्ड औपर
 (‘descendant of Upara’) is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (vi. 2, 9, 4) and the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (iii. 8, 7) as having performed a certain rite.

दण्डन
दण्डन
 occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 2, 54. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 682. among other names of ‘reed’ or ‘cane.’

दत्ततापस
दत्त तापस
 was Hotr2 priest at the snake festival described in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

दधि
दधि,
 ‘sour milk,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 2, 9; ix. 87, 1, etc. and later. 2) Av. iii. 12, 7; iv. 34, 6; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 3, 4, etc.; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xviii. 5, 12, etc. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) i. 8, 1, 7. Cf. Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 348. mentions in order Ghrta (‘clarified butter’), Dadhi, Mastu, which Eggeling 4) Sacred Books of the East, 12, 218. renders ‘whey,’ and A1miks2a1, ‘curds.’ Dadhi often has the meaning of ‘curds’ also. It was used for mixing with Soma. 5) Dadhya1s4ir, ‘mixed with sour milk,’ is an epithet of Soma in Rv. i. 5, 5; 137, 2; v. 51, 7; vii. 32, 4. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 219 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227.

दध्यञ्चाथर्वण
दध्यञ्च् आथर्वण
 is a purely mythical sage. In the Rigveda 1) i. 80, 16; 84, 13, 14; 116, 12; 117, 22; 119, 9, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 141, 142; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 176. he is clearly a divinity of some kind, but in the later Sam2hita1s 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 4, 4; 6, 6, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xix. 4. and the Bra1hman2as 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 18; vi. 4, 2, 3; xiv. 1, 1, 18. 20. 25; 4, 13; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28, etc. he is metamorphosed into a teacher. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hmana 4) xii. 8, 6. So also Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 21. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxxv; Atharvaveda, 23, 116, 118, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. he is by oversight called an A1n3girasa.

दध्याशिर्
दध्य्-आशिर्
 See Dadhi and Soma.

दन्त्
दन्त्, दन्त,
 ‘tooth,’ is frequently mentioned from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. vii. 55, 2; x. 68, 6; Av. v. 23, 3; 29, 4; vi. 56, 3, etc. The more usual form is Danta, Rv. iv. 6, 8; vi. 75, 11; Av. iv. 3, 6, etc. Cleansing (dha1v) the teeth was an ordinary act, especially in preparation for a sacrifice, and accompanied bathing, shaving of the hair and beard (kes4a-s4mas4ru), and the cutting of the nails. 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 6, 2 (not exactly paralleled in Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 1, 2 et seq.). A hymn of the Atharvaveda 3) vi. 140. celebrates the appearance of the first two teeth of a child, though its exact interpretation is doubtful. 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 321; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 224; Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 176; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 540, 541; Atharvaveda, 71; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 386. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 5) vii. 14; S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xv. 18. there is a reference to a child's first teeth falling out. The word seems in the Rigveda 6) iv. 6, 8; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 99; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 341, 342. once to denote an elephant's tusk. Whether dentistry was practised is doubtful. The occurrence in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 7) ii. 1, 5. of Hiran2ya-dant, ‘gold-toothed,’ as the name of a man, is perhaps significant, especially as it is certain that the stopping of teeth with gold was known at Rome as early as the legislation of the Twelve Tables. 8) Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 206. See Wordsworth, Fragments and Specimens of Early Latin, 537.

दभीति
दभीति
 appears several times in the Rigveda as a hero or sage. Indra overcomes on his behalf Cumuri and Dhuni; 1) x. 113, 9; ii. 15, 9; vii. 19, 4. he pressed Soma for Indra, 2) vi. 20, 13. who rewarded him. 3) vi. 26, 6. For him 30,000 Da1sas were sent to sleep, 4) iv. 30, 21. and for him the Dasyus were bound without cords. 5) ii. 13, 9. Dabhi1ti also appears, with Turvi1ti, as a prote4ge4 of the As4vins. 6) i. 112, 23. There seems no reason to deny that he was a real person. 7) Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 155, 157, 158. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 162.

दम
दम,
 ‘house,’ is a word that occurs several times in the Rigveda. 1) i. 1, 8; 61, 9; 75, 5; 143, 4; ii. 1, 2, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 24. It denotes, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But this seems very doubtful in view of the apparent connexion of  and , ‘build,’ in Greek. the place in which a man wields uncontrolled power (from the root dam, ‘control’).

दम्पति
दम्-पति
 denotes ‘the master of the house’ 1) For the form, cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 37, n. 9. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2. 307 et seq., argues in favour of the spelling dam2pati (adopted by Geldner in his R2gveda, Glossar). Cf. patir dan. Rv. i. 149, 2; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 176, 177. in the Rigveda, 2) i. 127, 8; ii. 39, 2; v. 22, 4; viii. 69. 16; 84, 7. but is more often used in the dual to designate ‘the master and the mistress,’ 3) Rv. v. 3, 2; viii. 31, 5; x. 10, 5; 68, 2; 85, 32; 95, 12, etc.; Av. vi. 123, 3; xii. 3, 14; xiv. 2, 9, etc. Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 418, 420. an expression that may legitimately be deemed to show the high status of women at the time of the Rigveda. See Stri1.

दर्भ
दर्भ
 is the name of a grass in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 3 (with S4ara and Kus4ara, varieties of grass). and later. 2) Av. vi. 43, 2; viii. 7, 20; x. 4, 13; xi. 6, 15; xix. 28, 1. etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 1, 4, etc. In the Atharvaveda it is used for the calming of anger (manyus4amana), 3) Av. vi. 43. and as an amulet for protection against the scattering of one's hair or the striking of one's breast. 4) xix. 32, 2. Cf. xix. 30. It is also said to be ‘rich in roots’ (bhu1ri-mu1la), 5) Av. vi. 43, 2. to possess a thousand leaves (sahasra-parn2a) and a hundred stalks (s4ata-ka1n2d2a). 6) Av. xix. 32, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. 

दर्वि
दर्वि,
 or Darvi1, properly denotes a ‘ladle,’ in which sense it is found in the Rigveda 1) v. 6, 9; x. 105, 10. and later. 2) Av. iii. 10, 7; iv. 14, 7; ix. 6, 17, etc. But the word also means a serpent's ‘hood’ in the Atharvaveda, 3) x. 1, 13. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 577. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 153. though Zimmer regards it as the name of a serpent. ^4 Altindisches Leben, 95, where he takes Karikrata also as the name of a snake.

दर्विदा
दर्विदा,
 the ‘woodpecker,’ is mentioned as a victim at the As4vamedha or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 13, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 15, Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. The St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., suggests ‘woodpiercer’ (da1ru-vidha) as the literal sense. On the etymology, cf. F. W. Thomas's article. ‘The D.Suffix,’ p. 121, in Transactions of the Cambridge Philological Society, 5, part ii. Cf. Da1rva1gha1ta.

दर्श
दर्श
 (‘appearance’) denotes the new moon day, 1) Av. vii. 81, 3, 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 1, 14; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 2, 2, 1. usually in opposition to the day of full moon (pu1rn2a-ma1sa). 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 4, 1, etc. Most frequently the word occurs in the compound 3) Ibid., i. 6, 7, 1; 9, 3; ii. 5, 6, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 2, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 5, 11, etc. dars4a-pu1rn2ama1sau, ‘new and full moon,’ the days of special ritual importance. 4) Hillebrandt, Das altindische Neuund Vollmondsopfer, Jena, 1880; Rituallitteratur, 111-114; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 439. The order of the first two words here is worthy of note, for it distinctly suggests, though it does not conclusively prove, that the month was reckoned from new moon to new moon, not from full moon to full moon. See Ma1sa.

दशग्व
दश-ग्व
 appears in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 12, 2 as the name of a person who was assisted by Indra. The other references in that work, 2) They are mentioned with the Navagvas in i. 62, 4; iii. 39, 5; iv. 51, 4; v. 29, 12; x. 62, 6, and alone in ii. 34, 12. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 144 (C). however, clearly show the mythical character of the Das4agvas, and of any individual among them. 

दशतयी
दशतयी
 in the Nirukta 1) vii. 8. 20; xi. 16; xii. 40. frequently denotes the text of the Rigveda as divided into ten Man2d2alas.

दशद्यु
दश-द्यु
 appears twice in the Rigveda 1) i. 33, 14; vi. 26, 4. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. as the name of a hero, but nothing can be made out regarding him or his relation to Vetasu, who is mentioned in one passage along with him.

दशन्
दशन्,
 ‘ten,’ forms the basis of the numerical system of the Vedic Indians, as it does of the A1ryan people generally. But it is characteristic of India 1) Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 70. that there should be found at a very early period long series of names for very high numerals, whereas the A1ryan knowledge did not go beyond 1,000. In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 2) xvii. 2 et seq. Cf. xxii. 34; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 1, 2, 16. the list is 1; 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000 (ayuta); 100,000 (niyuta); 1,000,000 (prayuta); 10,000,000 (arbuda); 100,000,000 (nyarbuda); 1,000,000,000 (samudra); 10,000,000,000 (madhya); 100,000,000,000 (anta); 1,000,000,000,000 (para1rdha). In the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 3) xxxix. 6. In xvii. 10 the number badva disappears, and the list corresponds with that of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, except for the fact that niyuta and prayuta change places. the list is the same, but niyuta and prayuta exchange places, and after nyarbuda a new figure (badva) intervenes, thus increasing samudra to 10,000,000,000, and so on. The Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 has in two places 4) iv. 4, 11, 4; vii. 2, 20, 1. exactly the same list as the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. The Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 5) ii. 8, 14. has the list ayuta, prayuta, then ayuta again, arbuda, nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta, para1rdha. The Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 6) xvii. 14, 2. has the Va1jasaneyi list up to nyarbuda inclusive, then follow nikharvaka, badva, aks2ita, and apparently go = 1,000,000,000,000. The Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 7) i. 10, 28, 29. Cf. Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 3, 2; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30, n. 2; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka 293, 294. list replaces nikharvaka by nikharva, badva by padma, and ends with aks2itir vyoma1ntah2. The S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 8) xv. 11, 7. continues the series after nyarbuda with nikharva1da, samudra, salila, antya, ananta (= 10 billions). But beyond ayuta 9) Cf. Rv. iii. 6, 15; viii. 1, 5; 2, 41, 21, 18; 34, 15; 46, 22; Av. viii. 2, 21; 8, 7; x. 8, 24; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xix. 13, 6; xxi. 18, 3, etc. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 348, considers that it has not any definite sense in the Rigveda; this cannot be either proved or disproved. The Rv. has the phrase s4ata1 sahasra1n2i several times (iv. 32, 18; viii. 32, 18, etc.) = 100,000; and ayuta may easily have been already specialized, though it may also have retained a vague sense. none of these numbers has any vitality. Badva, indeed, occurs in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 10) vii. 21. 23. but it cannot there have any precise numerical sense; 11) Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 96. and later on the names of these high numerals are very much confused. An arithmetical progression of some interest is found in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 12) xviii. 3. Cf. La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 10, 1 et seq.; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 9, 1-6. where occurs a list of sacrificial gifts in which each successive figure doubles the amount of the preceding one. It begins with dva1das4a-ma1nam2 hiran2yam, ‘gold to the value of 12’ (the unit being uncertain, but probably the Kr2s2n2ala), 13) Cf. Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 9, 1; Weber, op. cit., 102, 103. followed by ‘to the value of 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768, 1,536, 3072,’ then dve as2t2a1vim2s4ati-s4ata-ma1ne, which must mean 2×128×24 (the last unit being not a single ma1na, but a number of 24 ma1nas) = 6,144, then 12,288, 24,576, 49,152, 98,304, 196,608, 393, 216. With these large numbers may be compared the minute theoretical subdivision of time found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 14) xii. 3, 2, 1 et seq. Cf. also Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 1, 1, where a series of names of the divisions of the muhu1rta is given, apparently as alternatives, not as successive stages (ida1ni1m, tada1ni1m, etarhi, ks2ipram, ajiram, a1s4uh2 (? a1s4u), nimes2ah2, phan2ah2, dravan, atidravan, tvaran, tvarama1n2ah2, a1s4uh2, a1s4i1ya1n, javah2). See Weber, op. cit., 92-94. where a day is divided into 15 muhu1rtas--1 muhu1rta = 15 ks2ipras, 1 ks2ipra = 15 etarhis, 1 etarhi = 15 ida1nis, 1 ida1ni = 15 pra1n2as. The S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 15) xiv. 75 et seq. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana Aran2yaka, vii. 20. has a decimal division of the day into 15 muhu1rtas-1 muhu1rta = 10 nimes2as, 1 nimes2a = 10 dhvam2sis. Few fractions are mentioned in Vedic literature. Ardha, pa1da, s4apha, and kala1 denote (1/2), (1/4), (1/8), (1/16) respectively, but only the first two are common. Tr2ti1ya denotes the third part. 16) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 1, 4; v. 2, 6, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 6, 1; 7, 1, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 4, 4, etc. In the Rigveda 17) vi. 69, 8 = Av. vii. 44, 1 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 11, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 15; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 1, 13. Indra and Vis2n2u are said to have divided 1,000 by 3, though how they did so is uncertain. Tri-pa1d denotes ‘three-fourths.’ 18) Rv. x. 90, 4. There is no clear evidence that the Indians of the Vedic period had any knowledge of numerical figures, though it is perfectly possible. 19) If as2t2a-karn2i1 means in Rv. x. 62, 7, having the figure 8 marked on the ears' of cattle, then the mention of numerical signs would be certain. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 234, 235, 348. But this is doubtful. See Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 309, n. 10. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 308; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 90-103; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 349; Kaegi, Rigveda, n. 65; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 275 et seq.

दशपुरुषंराज्य
दश-पुरुषं-राज्य,
 occurring in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) xii. 9, 3, 1. 3. doubtless 2) Cf. A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 3; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 14, 18. So tri-purus2a, ‘three generations,’ Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 7. The St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Eggeling Sacred Books of the East, 44, 269, have the correct rendering. means ‘sovereignty inherited through ten ancestors,’ a striking case of hereditary rule. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 1, 209. But see 10, 75, n. 1. once rendered the word as the ‘kingdom 4) This would be sa1mra1jya, which is always spelt with m, not m2; cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 75, 3. of Das4apuru,’ comparing the Das4apura of Ka1lida1sa's Meghadu1ta 5) i. 48. and the Das4a1rn2a of the ‘middle country.’

दशमास्य
दश-मास्य,
 ‘ten months old,’ describes in the Rigveda 1) v. 78, 7-8. and later 2) Av. i. 11, 6; iii. 23, 2. There are several references in Vedic literature to birth in the tenth month, as Rv. x. 184, 3, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 366; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 313, n. 1. the embryo immediately before birth. See Ma1sa.

 denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 4, 7. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xxii. 14. the period of life between 90 and 100 years which the Rigveda 3) i. 158, 6. calls the das4ama yuga, ‘the tenth stage of life.’ Longevity seems not to have been rare among the Vedic Indians, for the desire to live a ‘hundred autumns’ (s4aradah2 s4atam) is constantly expressed. 4) Rv. i. 89, 9; x. 18, 10, and passim. See Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 384; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 62, 63. Di1rghatamas is said to have lived 100 years, 5) S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, ii. 17. and Mahida1sa Aitareya is credited with 116. 6) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 16, 7; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iv. 2, 11; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 17. Onesikritos 7) In Strabo, p. 701. reported that they sometimes lived 130 years, a statement with which corresponds the wish expressed in the Ja1taka 8) Ed. Fausbo7ll, ii. 16. for a life of 120 years. Probably the number was always rather imaginary than real, but the comparative brevity of modern life in India 9) Indian Empire, 1, 513 et seq. may be accounted for by the cumulative effect of fever, which is hardly known to the Rigveda. See Takman.

दशवृक्ष
दश-वृक्ष
 is the name of a tree, according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. in the Atharvaveda. 2) ii. 9, 1. But Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 50. treats the word as a mere adjective meaning ‘of ten trees.’

दशव्रज
दश-व्रज
 is the name of a prote4ge4 of the As4vins in the Rigveda (viii. 8, 20; 49, 1; 50, 9).

 is the name of a sacrificer mentioned in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 52, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

दशा
दशा
 denotes the ‘fringe’ or ‘border’ of a garment (va1sah2) in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) iii. 3, 2, 9, and often in the Su1tras. The word also occurs in the compound das4a1-pavitra, 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 32; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 2, 2, 11. Cf. iv. 1, 1. 28. which means ‘a filtering cloth with a fringe.’ 

दशोणि
दशोणि
 appears in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 4, 8. apparently as a favourite of Indra and as opposed to the Pan2is, who fell in hundreds for his benefit. The view of Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; 5, 107. that he is here the priest of the Pan2is is very improbable. Elsewhere his name is simply mentioned. 3) x. 96, 12, where, however, the word may be merely an epithet of Soma. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 92, n. 1; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. See also Das4on2ya.

दशोण्य
दशोण्य
 is the name of a sacrificer mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 52, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. along with Das4as4ipra and others. Whether he is identical with Das4on2i cannot be decided.

दस्यवे वृक,
 ‘wolf to the Dasyu,’ is the name of a man mentioned four times in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 51, 2; 55, 1; 56, 1. 2. In one hymn 2) viii. 51. he is called a R2s2i, but in two others 3) viii. 55. 56. he is clearly a prince victorious over the Dasyus, and a generous patron of the singer. It is hardly necessary to assume different persons, 4) Especially as the name occurs only in the small collection of Ka1n2va hymns forming the Va1lakhilya group in the eighth Man2d2ala. for the term R2s2i is not altogether inconsistent with royalty. He was son of Pu1takratu 5) viii. 56, 2. Pautakrata. Cf. viii. 68, 17. and Pu1takrata1, 6) viii. 56, 4. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139, 164; 5, 552. his wife.

दस्यवेसह
दस्यवे सह
 is, according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the name of a man or a clan in the Rigveda. 2) i. 36, 18. But he admits that the words may be an epithet of Agni. This is the interpretation given to them by Oldenberg. 3) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 33.

दस्यु
दस्यु,
 a word of somewhat doubtful origin, is in many passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 34, 7; 100, 18; ii. 13, 9, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 157, 158. clearly applied to superhuman enemies. On the other hand, there are several passages in which human foes, probably the aborigines, are thus designated. This may be regarded as certain in those passages where the Dasyu is opposed to the A1ryan, who defeats him with the aid of the gods. 2) Rv. i. 51, 8; 103, 3; 117, 21; ii. 11, 18, 19; iii. 34, 9; vi. 18, 3; vii. 5, 6; x. 49, 3. Probably also in v. 70, 3; x. 83, 6, people are meant. The great difference between the Dasyus and the A1ryans was their religion: the former are styled ‘not sacrificing,’ ‘devoid of rites,’ ‘addicted to strange vows,’ ‘godhating,’ and so forth. 3) The Dasyu is called a-karman, ‘riteless,’ x. 22, 8; a-devayu, ‘indifferent to the gods,’ viii. 70, 11; a-brahman, ‘without devotion,’ iv. 16, 9; a-yajvan, ‘not sacrificing,’ viii. 70, 11; a-yajyu, id., vii. 6, 3; a-vrata, ‘lawless,’ i. 51, 8; 175, 3; vi. 14, 3; ix. 41, 2; anyavrata, ‘following strange ordinances,’ viii. 70, 11; deva-pi1yu, ‘reviling the gods,’ Av. xii. 1, 37. It is impossible in all cases to be certain that people are meant. As compared with the Da1sa, they are less distinctively a people: no clans (vis4ah2) of the Dasyus are mentioned, and while Indra's dasyu-hatya, ‘slaughter of the Dasyus,’ is often spoken of, there is no corresponding use of da1sa-hatya. That the Dasyus were real people is, however, shown by the epithet ana1s applied to them in one passage of the Rigveda. 5) Rv. v. 29, 10. The sense of this word is not absolutely certain: the Pada text and Sa1yan2a both take it to mean ‘without face’ (an-a1s), 6) This sense allows of two interpretations: ‘misfeatured,’ which seems that of Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Grassmann, Wo7rterbuch; or ‘speechless’ (that is, unable to speak the language of the A1ryans), which is that of Bollensen, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 41, 496. but the other rendering, ‘noseles’ (a-na1s), is quite possible, 7) This view is supported by Megasthenes' report as to natives who were : see Strabo, p. 711; Pliny, Nat. Hist., vii. 2, 18, cited by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 430. See also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 109; 5, 95; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 277; Knauer, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 29, 52; Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 2, 293 (accent). 4 Rv. i. 51, 5, 6; 103, 4; x. 95, 7; 99, 7; 105, 11. Cf. dasyu-han. ‘Dasyuslaying,’ i. 100, 12; vi. 45, 24; viii. 76, 11; 77, 3; x. 47, 4 (all of Indra); vi. 16, 15; viii. 39, 8 (of Agni), etc. and would accord well with the flat-nosed aborigines of the Dravidian 8) The suggestion in the Indian Empire, 1, 390, that the modern Brahui type is the true Dravidian, while the modern Dravidian is the result of fusion with Mun2d2a1-speaking tribes, would render this theory improbable. But it seems more probable that the Brahuis in speech preserve the tradition of Dravidian settlements in North India. type, whose language still persists among the Brahuis, who are found in the north-west. This interpretation would receive some support from Vr2tra's being called ‘broken-nosed’ if this were a correct explanation of the obscure word ruja1na1s. 9) See Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 415 (who takes ruja1na1h2 of Rv. i. 32, 8, as = ruja1na-na1h2); Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 31, 32 (who suggests as possible the analysis of the word as ruja1-ana1h2). But cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 361, who suggests the emendation ruja1nah2 as nominative singular of the simple participle ‘broken’; Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 59, n. 1. The other epithet of the Dasyus is mr2dhra-va1c, which occurs with ana1s, 10) Rv. v. 29, 10. and which has been rendered 11) Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 393 et seq. ‘of stammering, or unintelligible speech.’ This version is by no means certain, and since the epithet is elsewhere 12) The expression is used of the A1ryan Pu1rus in vii. 18, 13; of the Pan2is in vii. 6, 3; and of hostile persons in i. 174, 2; v. 32, 8; x. 23, 5. Roth, Erla7uterungen zum Nirukta, 97, thinks the sense is ‘of insulting speech,’ and Zimmer, op. cit., 114, 115, strongly supports this view. But Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 89, 90, 114, prefers to see in it ‘speaking an enemy's speech,’ and thinks that the Pu1rus were dialectically different from the Bharatas--a view which can be supported from the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 1, 23, 24, where the Asuras say he'lavo (= he'rayo, ‘ho, enemies,’ in Sanskrit). See Muir, op. cit., 2^2, 114; Davidson, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 37, 23 (the Maha1bha1s2ya version); Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 31, n. 3. The word could thus apply to the Dasyus also, as the strange speech of the enemy could be either A1ryan or aboriginal. applied to A1ryans, its correct meaning is more probably ‘of hostile speech.’ Dasyu corresponds with the Iranian dan3hu, daqyu, which denotes a ‘province.’ Zimmer 13) Op. cit., 110 et seq. So Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 158. thinks that the original meaning was ‘enemy,’ whence the Iranians developed the sense of ‘hostile country,’ ‘conquered country,’ ‘province,’ while the Indians, retaining the signification of ‘enemy,’ extended it to include demon foes. Roth 14) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. considers that the meaning of human enemy is a transfer from the strife of gods and demons. Lassen 15) Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 633 et seq. This theory is now generally discredited. Cf. Justi, Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1866, 1446 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 142; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 162 et seq.; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 156. attempted to onnect the contrast daqyu: dasyu with that of daeva: deva, and to see in it a result of the religious differences which, according to Haug's theory, had separated the Iranians and the Indians. The word may have originally meant ‘ravaged land’ 16) Both this word and Da1sa appear to be derived from the root das, which, according to Whitney, Roots, means ‘lay waste’; but, according to Roth, ‘suffer want,’ ‘waste away.’ as a result of invasion; hence ‘enemies’ country,' then ‘hostile people,’ who as human foes were more usually called by the cognate name of Da1sa. Individual Dasyus are Cumuri, S4ambara, S4us2n2a, etc. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 17) vii. 18, where the descendants of Vis4va1mitra are called dasyu1na1m2 bhu1yis2t2ha1h2; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 26, 7. the word has, as later, 18) Manu, v. 131; x. 32. 45; Zimmer, op. cit., 118. Cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., 3, 276 et seq.; Zimmer, op. cit., 101 et seq. the sense of uncivilized peoples generally.

दाक्षायण
दाक्षायण,
 ‘descendant of Daks2a.’ The Da1ks2a1yan2as are mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Av. i. 35, 1, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 51, 52; Kat2ha, cited by von Schroeder, Tu1binger Kat2ha-Handschriften, 36; Khila, iv. 7, 7, 8. as having given gold to S4ata1ni1ka. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) vi. 7, 4, 2: da1ks2a1yan2a-hasta, ‘goldenhande.’ Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 283, n. 2, seems unnecessarily doubtful as to this. the word is actually used to denote ‘gold.’ The Da1ks2a1yan2as appear there 3) ii. 4, 4, 6. Cf. Artareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 40. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 224; 4, 358; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 195; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 35; Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 138. as a race of princes who, because of performing a certain rite, prospered down to the time of the Bra1hman2a itself.

दात्यौह
दात्यौह,
 a ‘gallinule,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 25. 39. Pa1n2ini, vii. 3. 1, derives the word from ditya-vah. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91. The word is clearly a variant of da1tyu1ha, which occurs in the epics and law books.

दात्र
दात्र
 (‘cutter’), denoting a ‘sickle,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 78, 10; Nirukta, ii. 1. Cows ‘with sickle-shaped marks on their ears’ (da1tra-karn2yah2) are referred to in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1. 2) iv. 2, 9. Otherwise the expression is only found later, occurring in the Su1tra and epic literature. 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. See also Sr2n2i.

दात्रेय
दात्रेय
 is the patronymic of Ara1d2a S4aunaka in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. Possibly Da1rteya, ‘descendant of Dr2ti,’ should be read, 2) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. but the word may have the same derivation as the latter form with metathesis.

दाधीच
दाधीच,
 ‘descendant of Dadhyanc,’ is the patronymic of Cyavana in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiv. 6).

दान
1. Da1na, ‘giving,’ ‘gift,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda, especially in the Da1na-stutis 1) The term seems first to occur in the Br2haddevata1, vi. 45, 92, and in similar works. (‘Praises of Gifts’) of generous patrons (see Daks2in2a1). One of the characteristics of the Bra1hman2a is his right to receive gifts, which it is obligatory on the other castes to present. 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 7, 1; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 47-61. The gift of a daughter (kanya1ya1 da1nam) was a form of marriage 3) Nirukta, iii. 4. (see Viva1ha), because in it the girl was ‘given’ away by her father or brother.

दान
2. Da1na (‘distribution’) 1) From da1, ‘divide.’ seems in several passages of the Rigveda 2) i. 55, 7; 48, 4; 180, 5; viii. 46, 26; 60, 8; 99, 4, etc. Cf., however, Pischel Vedische Studien, 1, 100. to be a designation of the sacrificial feast to which the god is invited (cf. ). In one passage 3) Rv. viii. 33, 8; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 157. Sa1yan2a thinks that it denotes the mada-jala1ni, ‘drops of water falling from the temples of a rutting elephant,’ 4) Da1na in this sense, so common in the post-Vedic language, is probably derived from da1, ‘divide,’ meaning originally ‘secretion.’ but this is doubtful. In another passage 5) ii. 13, 7. Roth thinks that ‘pasture land’ is meant.

दान
3. Da1na is in three passages of the Rigveda 1) v. 27, 5; vii. 18, 23; viii. 46, 24. But in all these cases ‘gifts’ seems an adequate version, ‘horses’ being understood. held by Roth to designate a chariot horse.

दामन्
दामन्,
 a ‘rope’ or ‘girdle,’ 1) Originally ‘bond,’ from da1, ‘bind.’ is often mentioned in the Rigveda and later. 2) Rv. i. 56, 3, etc.; Av. vi. 63, 1; 103, 2; vii. 103, 1. 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 13, 1, etc. Reference is made to the rope of the sacrificial horse, 3) Rv. i. 162, 8. as well as to the practice of tying calves with ropes. 4) Rv. ii. 28, 7. The word occurs in the sense of a ‘band’ of horse hair in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 5) v. 3, 1, 10. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 2.

दाय
दाय
 occurs in the Rigveda 1) x. 114, 10. only in the sense of ‘reward’ of exertion (s4rama), but later it means ‘inheritance’--that is, a father's property which is to be divided among his sons either during his lifetime or after his death. The passages all negative the idea that the property of the family was legally family property: it is clear that it was the property of the head of the house, usually the father, and that the other members of the family only had moral claims upon it which the father could ignore, though he might be coerced by his sons if they were physically stronger. Thus Manu is said in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 2) iii. 1, 9, 4 et seq. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 191-194; Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 67, 68. to have divided his property among his sons. He omitted Na1bha1nedis2t2ha, whom he afterwards taught how to appease the An3girases, and to procure cows. This is a significant indication that the property he divided was movable property, rather than land (Urvara1). In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 3) v. 14. the division is said to have been made during Manu's lifetime by his sons, who left only their aged father to Na1bha1nedis2t2ha. According to the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, 4) iii. 156 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 61, 62). again, four sons divided the inheritance while their old father, Abhiprata1rin, was still alive. It is, of course, possible to regard Da1ya as denoting the heritable property of the family, but the developed patria potestas of the father, which was early very marked, as shown by the legend of S4unah2s4epa, is inconsistent with the view that the sons were legally owners with their father, unless and until. they actually insisted on a division of the property. 5) The same question has been raised as to the origin of English or Teutonic property in land generally. Against any idea even of family ownership in a strict sense of the word, see Fustel de Coulanges, Recherches sur quelques Proble11mes d'Histoire, 322 et seq.; Ashley, in Fustel de Coulanges, Origin of Property in Land, xvi-xxi; Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, 2, 237 et seq. The older view, which accepted family and communal ownership, represented in different forms by Maine (Village Communities in the East and West), Stubbs, Green, and others, is defended in a new form by Vinogradoff, Villanage in England. See also Keith, Journal of the African Society, 6, 201 et seq. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 93-96, does not accept the communal ownership of land, but, ibid., 80, is inclined to believe in the joint ownership of a family. He admits that this is inconsistent with the strict rule of patria potestas, which still exists in Bengal; Baden Powell, Village Communities in India, 133 et seq., doubts the existence in early India of such a patria potestas. But the facts seem clearly to show that there was such a power, and that the father owned the property. His sons, as they grew up, came to claim the property, and he might have to divide it; hence the idea naturally developed that every child on birth had a legal share in the property. No doubt also from the first the right to part with land was one which grown-up sons and the rest of the community could object to, once the village had acquired a fixed existence. This would account adequately for the later system. Cf. also pp. 100, n. 19; 336, n. 7, and Ra1janya. Probably-there is no evidence of any decisive character--land was not divided at first, but no doubt its disposal began to follow the analogy of cattle and other movable property as soon as the available supply of arable land became limited. As for the method of division, it is clear from the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 6) ii. 5, 2, 7. that the elder son was usually preferred; perhaps this was always the case after death. During the father's lifetime another might be preferred, as appears from a passage of the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 7) xvi. 4, 4. Women were excluded from partition or inheritance, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 8) iv. 4, 2, 13. and the Nirukta. 9) iii. 4. They were, no doubt, supported by their brothers; but if they had none they might be reduced to prostitution. 10) Cf. Ztri1. Detailed rules of inheritance appear in the Su1tras. 11) Inheritance is also alluded to in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 27, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 2, 22; iii. 2, 1, 18. For the Su1tra rules, see Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 80 et seq. The heir is called Dayada, 12) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 4, 3, 9; Nirukta, iii. 4; metaphorically, Av. v. 18, 6, 14. ‘receiver (a1-da) of inheritance.’

दार
दार,
 ‘wife,’ is found in the Su1tras (usually as a plural masculine), and once (as a singular) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) vi. 4, 12 (where dva1ren2a is a varia lectio; see St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.).

दारु
दारु,
 ‘wood,’ is frequently mentioned in the Rigveda and later, 1) Rv. vi. 3, 4; x. 145, 4, etc.; Av. x. 4, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 8, 3, etc. denoting amongst other things the pole of a chariot, 2) Rv. x. 102, 8. logs as fuel, 3) Rv. viii. 102, 20. the wooden parts of a car, 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 6, 2, 14. possibly wooden stocks, 5) Av. vi. 121, 2. But this is doubtful. Cf. Ta1ya and Drupada. and so forth.

Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. identifies him with S4ya1va1s4va, but the Br2haddevata1 3) v. 50. 77. with Rathavi1ti. The same patronymic is frequently 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 2, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 12; 6, 5; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, vii. 4. Cf.

दाव
दाव,
 ‘forest fire,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 45, 2. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 2) xi. 2, 7, 32. In the latter work such fires are referred to as occurring in spring. According to Sieg, 3) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 44 et seq. a hymn of the Rigveda 4) x. 142. Sieg's interpretation of this hymn is not at all probable. describes a forest fire. Watchers were employed to guard against surprise from such conflagrations (da1va-pa). 5) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 16; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 11, 1.

दावसुआङ्गिरस
दाव-सु आङ्गिरस,
 a seer of Sa1mans, or chants, is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 5, 12, 14. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160.

दाश
दाश,
 ‘fisherman,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 16; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 12, 1. Weber, Indische Streifen 1, 81, renders the word by Fischerknecht, perhaps regarding it as equivalent to da1sa, ‘servant.’ Cf. Manu, x. 34; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Da1s4a, 2. 3. Cf. Dhaivara.

दाशतय
दाशतय,
 ‘belonging to the (Rigveda text) divided into ten (books),’ is an epithet of Adhya1ya, ‘section,’ in the Nida1na Su1tra. 1) ii. 11 (Indische Studien, 1, 45) The feminine form of the word is also found in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 2) viii. 7. and later 3) R2gveda Pra1tis4a1khya, xvi. 54; xvii. 30; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 2, 16, 22, etc.; Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxvi. 13; xxvii. 4, etc.

दाशराज्ञ
दाश-राज्ञ
 is the name in the Rigveda 1) vii. 33, 2, 5; 83, 8. and the Atharvaveda 2) x. 128, 12. of Suda1s' famous ‘battle with the ten kings.’ It is somewhat difficult to make out exactly who the kings were (see Turvas4a), but the number is probably a round one, and cannot be pressed. The actual battle hymn 3) 8, 18 does not contain the word, and the passages in which it is found may reasonably be considered late. 4) Cf. for the late date of vii. 33, Bergaigne, L'histoire de la Sam2hita, 38, 72; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 198, 200, 265, n. 1; Arnold, Vedic Metre, 309; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 130, opposes this view, but not convincingly.

दाशर्म
दाशर्म
 appears in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 1) vii. 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 472. as a teacher and a contemporary of A1run2i.

दास
दास,
 like Dasyu, sometimes denotes enemies of a demoniac character in the Rigveda, 1) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 157. but in many passages 2) Cf. Rv. v. 34, 6; vi. 22, 10; 33, 3; 50, 6; vii. 83, 1; x. 38, 3; 69, 6; 3, 1; Av. v. 11, 3. the word refers to human foes of the A1ryans. The Da1sas are described as having forts (purah2), 3) ii. 20, 8 (called a1yasi1h2, ‘made of iron’); i. 103, 3; iii. 12, 6; iv. 32, 10. They are called s4a1radi1h2, ‘autumnal,’ in 1. 131, 4; 174, 2; vi. 20, 10. Cf. also dehyah2, ‘ramparts,’ in vi. 47, 2. and their clans (vis4ah2) are mentioned. 4) ii. 11, 4; iv. 28, 4; vi. 25, 2. It is possible that the forts, which are called ‘autumnal’ (s4aradi1h2), 5) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 60. may be mythical, but it is not essential, for the epithet may allude to their being resorted to in the autumn season. The Da1sa colour (Varn2a) 6) ii. 12, 4; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 25, 6. Cf. Rv. i. 101, 1; 130, 8; ii. 20, 7; iv. 16, 13; vi. 47, 21; vii. 5, 3. The A1rya colour is mentioned in iii. 34, 9, and the Da1sa is contrasted with the Varn2a (of the singers) in i. 104, 2. The ‘white-hued (s4vitnya) friends’ who, in i. 100, 18, aid in the conquest of the Dasyu and Sim2yu are doubtless A1ryans. In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 30, the day and night (ahora1tre) are paralleled with the S4u1dra1ryau--that is, probably with the A1ryan and S4u1dra (the compound is not to be taken as giving the words in the correct order; cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 268). See also Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 140; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 10, 11. is probably an allusion to the black skin of the aborigines, which is also directly mentioned. 7) kr2s2n2a1 tvac, ‘black skin,’ i. 130, 8; ix. 41, 1. The aborigines (as Dasyus) are called ana1s, ‘noseless’(?), 8) Cf. Dasyu, notes 6, 7. and mr2dhra-va1c, ‘of hostile speech,’ 9) v. 29, 10. See Dasyu; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 138. and are probably meant by the phallus-worshippers (s4is4na-deva1h2, ‘whose deity is a phallus’) of the Rigveda. 10) vii. 21, 5; x. 99, 3. Cf. Macdonell, op. cit., p. 155. It is significant that constant reference is made to the differences in religion between A1rva and Da1sa or Dasyu. 11) Rv. i. 33, 4. 5; iv. 16, 9; v. 7, 10; 42, 9; vi. 14, 3; viii. 70, 10; x. 22, 7. 8, etc. Since the Da1sas were in many cases reduced to slavery, the word Da1sa has the sense of ‘slave’ in several passages of the Rigveda. 12) vii. 86, 7; viii. 56, 3; x. 62, 10. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 2, suggests that in viii. 46, 32, the word da1sa1n, ‘slaves,’ should be read in place of da1se, qualifying Balbu1tha. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 117, quotes the passage to indicate the admixture of A1ryan and Da1sa blood. See also Av. iv. 9, 8; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vii. 24, 2. It is uncertain whether da1sa-pravarga, as an epithet of rayi, ‘wealth,’ in Rv. i. 92, 8, means ‘consisting of troops of slaves.’ Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 82, so takes the expression in i. 158, 5. Da1si1, the feminine, always has this sense from the Atharvaveda 13) Av. v. 22, 6; xii. 3, 13; 4, 9; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 13, 2; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 10 (Ma1dhyam2dina = 2, 7 Ka1n2va). Zimmer, 107, sees this sense in vadhu1 in Rv. viii. 19, 36. See also Vadhu1mant. onwards. Aboriginal women were, no doubt, the usual slaves, for on their husbands being slain in battle they would naturally have been taken as servants. They would sometimes also become concubines; thus Kavas2a was taunted with being the son of a female slave (da1sya1h2 putrah2) in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 14) ii. 19; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xii. 3. Ludwig 15) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 209. considers that in some passages 16) See i. 158, 5; ii. 13, 8; iv. 30, 14. 15; vi. 20, 10; vii. 99, 5; x. 49, 6, 7. None of these passages need certainly be so taken. Da1sa is applied, in the sense of ‘enemy,’ to A1ryan foes, but this is uncertain. Zimmer 17) Altindisches Leben, 110 et seq. and Meyer 18) Geschichte des Altertums, 1, 515. think that Da1sa 19) If derived from das in the sense of ‘lay waste’ (Whitney, Roots), the original meaning would have been ‘devastator,’ ‘ravager.’ originally meant ‘enemy’ in general, later developing in Iran into the name of the Dahae 20) The Dahae may have been closely allied in race and language with the Iranians, but this is not very clearly proved. Cf. E. Kuhn in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 28, 214; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 95. The possibility or probability of mixture with Mongolian blood is always present. So Zimmer, op. cit., 112, calls the Daoi or Daai of Herodotus, i. 126, a Turanian tribe. of the Caspian steppes, and in India into a designation of the aborigines. On the other hand, Hillebrandt 21) Op. cit., 1, 94. argues that, as the Da1sas and the Pan2is are mentioned together, 22) Rv. v. 34, 6. 7; vii. 6, 3 (Dasyu and Pan2i together); Av. v. 11, 6. they must be deemed to be closely related tribes, identifying the Pan2is with the Parnians and the Da1sas of the Rigveda with the Dahae. This view, of course, necessitates a transfer of the scenes of the Rigveda, where Da1sas are prominent, and especially those in which Divoda1sa--‘the heavenly Da1sa’--plays an important part, 23) Op. cit., 1, 96 et seq., He argues that Da1sa occurs only four times in Man2d2ala vii., but eight times in vi., and that similarly S4ambara, the Da1sa, is mentioned six times in vi., but only twice in vii. But Divoda1sa much more probably means, as Oldenberg interprets the name, ‘the servant of heaven.’ See his Religion des Veda, 155, n. 1; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 209; below, p. 363, n. 11. to the far west. Hillebrandt justifies this by regarding the scene of the sixth book of the Rigveda as quite different from that of the seventh and third, in which Suda1s, the Bharatas, Vasis2t2ha, and Vis4va1mitra appear. The Sarasvati1 of the sixth book he locates in Arachosia, that of the seventh in the ‘Middle Country.’ It is, however, extremely doubtful whether this theory can be upheld. That Divoda1sa should have been a Da1sa, and yet have fought against other Da1sas, is not in itself likely, especially when his son Suda1s appears as a protagonist of A1ryan civilization. It also seems unreasonable to seek in Arachosia for the river Sarasvati, which it is natural to locate in the ‘Middle Country.’ The wealth of the Da1sas was no doubt considerable, 24) Cf. Rv. i. 176, 4; iv. 30, 13; viii. 40, 6; x. 69. 5; Av. vii. 90, 2. but in civilization there is no reason to suppose that they were ever equal to the invaders. 25) Cf. Rv. ii. 12, 11; iv. 30. 14; vi. 26, 5, whence it appears that the Da1sas were often dwellers in mountains, a natural refuge for beaten tribes. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 269-275, 368; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 207-213; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 101-118; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 35 (who derives da1sa from da1, ‘bind’), 254; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2, 359 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 96. Leading Da1sas were Ili1bis4a, Cumuri and Dhuni, Pipru, Varcin, S4ambara. For names of aboriginal tribes, see Kira1ta, Ki1kat2a, Can2d2a1la, Parn2aka, S4im2yu.

 occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) ii. 13, 8. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 209. probably designates a Da1sa named Ves4a. Sa1yan2a's interpretation of the word as ‘destruction of foes’ can hardly be correct.

Rv. x. 40, 2; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 51. Hillebrandt 4) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 40, 708 et seq. and Lanman 5) Sanskrit Reader, 385. consider that the word originally meant only ‘wooer,’ and applied to the king who, after the chief queen had lain beside the dead victim in the Purus2amedha or ‘human sacrifice,’ claimed her again; but this view is hardly plausible. 6) See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 848, 849; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 946. The term is also applied to the god Pu1s2an 7) vi. 55, 5. as the wooer of his mother, apparently Su1rya1. 8) Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 21; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 35. Cf.

दिधिषूपति

 occurs in the Ka1t2haka 1) xxxi. 7, quoted in Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 579. and Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1s, 2) xlvii. 7, quoted ibid., 579, 580. as well as in the A1pastamba, 3) ii. 5, 12, 22. Gautama, 4) xv. 16. and Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tras, 5) i. 18; xx. 7 et seq. in lists of people who have committed sin (enas). The traditional rendering 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. didhis2u, 3. is ‘husband of a woman married a second time’; Manu 7) iii. 173. seems to apply the term to the brother-in-law who is ‘married’ to his sister-in-law after his brother's death for the purpose of begetting a child, if he displays conjugal affection to her (anurajyate ka1matah2). 8) Cf. Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 106. This sense would be possible, since Didhis2u denotes a ‘wooer,’ and a widow could be regarded as a ‘wooer’ when able to control her own choice of a spouse. But another tradition 9) Lauga1ks2i, quoted by Kullu1ka on Manu, iii. 160; Commentary on A1pastamba, loc. cit. holds that Didhis2u1 means the elder sister whose younger sister has married before her. This view is supported by a passage in the Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, 10) xx. 7 et seq. and by the use of the word agredidhis2u1-pati, 11) Cf. agre-didhis2u, ‘one who woos (a younger sister) before (her elder sister is married),’ in A1pastamba, loc. cit.; Gautama, xv. 16; Vasis2t2ha, i. 18; Ka1t2haka, loc. cit.; agre-dadhus, Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 9; agre-dadhis2u, Kapis2t2hala, loc. cit.; agra-didhis2u, Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 11. which must mean the ‘husband of a younger sister married before the elder.’ In this case also Didhis2u1 would mean ‘wooer,’ the elder sister being so called because, if her parents do not arrange a marriage for her, she is, according to Vis2n2u, 12) Vis2n2u Dharma Su1tra, xxiv. 40. Cf. Delbru7ck, op. cit., 579-586. to make her own choice of a husband (kurya1t svayam2varam). See also Edidhis2uh2pati and Daidhis2avya.

 ‘sky.’ The world as a whole is regarded as divided into the three domains of ‘earth,’ ‘air’ or ‘atmosphere,’ and ‘heaven’ or ‘sky’ (div), 1) Rv. ii. 40; viii. 6, 15; 10, 6; 90, 6, etc. or alternatively into ‘heaven and earth’ (dya1va1-pr2thivi1), 2) Rv. i. 143, 2; 159, 1; 160, 1; iv. 14, 2, etc.; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 8, 3, 9; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vii. 4, 2; viii. 1, 3. In the Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 1, 2, and the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, vii. 3, it is said that when heavy and constant rain falls people say. ‘Heaven and earth have united.’ which two are then considered as comprising the universe, the atmosphere being included in the sky. Lightning, wind, and rain belong to the atmosphere, solar and similar phenomena to the sky. In some passages 3) Av. iv. 14, 3 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 67. the vault (na1ka) of the sky is added after the usual triad, and before the celestial light (svar, jyotis). The threefold division of the universe is reflected in a threefold division of the three elements--earth, air, and sky. Thus a highest (uttama, 4) Rv. v. 60, 6. uttara, 5) Rv. iv. 26, 6. pa1rya 6) Rv. vi. 40, 5. In Rv. v. 4, 3, it is called tr2ti1ya. ), a middle, and a lowest heaven are specified. 4) Rv. v. 60, 6. In the Atharvaveda 7) xviii. 2, 48. the three heavens are distinguished as ‘rich in water’ (udanvati1), as pi1lumati1 (of uncertain meaning), and as the pradyaus, where the Fathers sit. Heaven is frequently called vyoman as well as rocana 8) Tri1n2i or tri1 rocana1, Rv. i. 102, 8; 149, 4; v. 69, 1, etc. (properly the ‘luminous space’ of heaven), and the dividing firmament which separates the visible upper world from the highest heaven is called, besides na1ka, ‘vault,’ sa1nu, ‘summit,’ vis2t2ap, ‘surface,’ and pr2s2t2ha, ‘ridge,’ and even ‘ridge of the vault,’ 9) Rv. i. 125, 5. Cf. iii. 2, 12. or ‘summit of the vault.’ 10) Rv. viii. 103, 2. Cf. also ix. 86, 27. Similarly three atmospheres (rajas), or oftener two, are alluded to, 11) Rv. iv. 53, 5; v. 69, 1. Cf. also the references to the ‘highest’ atmosphere, uttama, ix. 22, 5; parama, iii. 30, 2; tr2ti1ya, ix. 74, 6; x. 45, 3; 123, 8. The ‘lower’ (upara) or ‘terrestrial’ (pa1rthiva) is contrasted with the ‘heavenly’ (divya) space. See i. 62, 5; iv. 53, 3. but the division here is merely artificial. In one passage 12) Rv. i. 164, 6. Cf. vii. 87, 5. six raja1m2si, ‘regions,’ are referred to, the heavens and the earths no doubt being meant. The usual name for the atmosphere is antariks2a. The three earths are equally artificial, the origin of the triad being probably the use of pr2thivi1 in the plural 13) Rv. i. 188, 9. 10; vii. 104, 11. to denote the three divisions of the universe (just as pitarau, ‘two fathers,’ denotes ‘father and mother’). 14) Cf. Delbru7ck, Altindische Syntax, p. 98; Macdonell, Sanskrit Grammar, 183c (p. 158). The earth is called ks2am, ks2a1, gma1, or designated by the epithets mahi1, ‘the great,’ pr2thivi1 or urvi1, ‘the broad,’ utta1na1, ‘the extended,’ and is regularly contrasted as idam, ‘this world here,’ with the upper sphere. 15) Rv. i. 22, 17; 154, 1. 3; and regularly in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. The shape of the earth is compared with a wheel in the Rigveda, 16) x. 89, 4. On the other hand, the earth is regarded as catur-bhr2s2t2i, ‘four-cornered,’ in Rv. x. 58, 3. and is expressly called ‘circular’ (pari-man2d2ala) in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 17) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 9. When earth is conjoined with heaven, the two are conceived as great bowls (camva1) turned towards each other. 18) Rv. iii. 55, 20. In the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 19) iii. 1, 2; S4a1n3kha1vana A1ran2yaka, vii. 3. the two are regarded as halves of an egg. The distance of heaven from the earth is given by the Atharvaveda 20) x. 8, 18 = xiii. 2, 38; 3, 14. as a thousand days' journey for the sun-bird, by the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 21) ii. 17. Cf. A1s4vina. as a thousand days' journey for a horse, while the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 22) xvi. 8, 6; in xxi. 1, 9, with the alternatives of 1,000 days of the journey of a horse, or of the sun, or 1,000 leagues. whimsically estimates the distance as equivalent to a thousand cows standing one on the top of the other. According to Zimmer, 23) Altindisches Leben, 357, 358. the Vedic poets conceived the atmosphere to be above the earth in its upper division only, but below it in its lower stratum. The evidence, 24) Rv. v. 81, 4; vi. 9, 1; vii. 80, 1. however, for the latter assumption is quite insufficient. 25) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 10. The theory of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 26) iii. 44, 4. Speyer's interpretation of this passage, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 723-727, is anticipated and supplemented by Macdonell, loc. cit. is that the sun merely reverses its bright side at night, turning its light on the stars and the moon while it retraverses its course to the east; and it has been shown 25) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 10. that this is probably the doctrine of the Rigveda also. 27) i. 115, 5; x. 37, 3. literature. The Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a See also Su1rya and Candrama1s. For the Vedic knowledge of the planets, see Graha. There is no geographical division of the earth in Vedic literature.

Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 5, 6; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 358-364. states that the centre of the earth is a span north of the Plaks2a Pra1sravan2a1, and that the centre of the sky is the constellation of the seven R2s2is, the Great Bear.

 is one of the leading princes of the early Vedic age. He was a son of Vadhryas4va, 1) Rv. vi. 61, 1. and father, or more probably grandfather, of Suda1s, the famous king of the Tr2tsu family, among the Bharatas. Probably Pijavana was the son and Suda1s the grandson. Divoda1sa was naturally a Bharata, 2) Rv. vi. 16, 4, 5, 19. For Suda1s as his descendant, see vii. 18, 25, with verse 23, where Paijavana is an epithet of Suda1s. and, like Suda1s, was an opponent of the Turvas4as and Yadus. 3) As Atithigva, Rv. vii. 19, 8; as Divoda1sa, ix. 61, 2. His great enemy was S4ambara, the Da1sa, who was apparently chief of a mountain people, 4) Rv. i. 130, 7; ii. 12, 11; vi. 26, 5; vii. 18, 20. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 161. and whom he repeatedly defeated. 5) See Rv. i. 112, 14; 116, 18; 119, 4; 130, 7-10; ii. 19, 6; iv. 26, 3; 30, 20; vi. 26, 3. 5; 43, 1; 47, 21. 22; ix. 61, 2. He was also, it seems, like his father Vadhryas4va, 6) Rv. x. 69, 1 et seq. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 176; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic, 1, 96, n. 2. an energetic supporter of the fire ritual, for Agni is once called by his name in the Rigveda. 7) Daivoda1sa, ‘worshipped by Divoda1sa’; viii. 103, 2. Cf. vi. 16, 5. 19; 31, 1. For the defeat by Indra, cf. Rv. i. 53, 10; ii. 14, 7; vi. 18, 13; viii. 64, 2; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 337, 344. On the other hand, he was defeated, with A1yu and Kutsa, by Indra's aid. In several passages he seems closely connected with the singer family, the Bharadva1jas. 8) Cf. Rv. i. 112, 13, 14; 116, 18; vi. 16, 5; 31, 4; 47, 22 et seq.; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xv. 3, 7; Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 104. From one passage, 9) vi. 61, 1 et seq. where Divoda1sa is said to have fought against the Pan2is, the Pa1ra1vatas, and Br2saya, Hillebrandt 10) Op. cit., 1, 97 et seq. has inferred that he was engaged in conflicts with the tribes of Arachosia, and interpreting the name as the ‘heavenly Da1sa’ 11) This is very improbable. See Bergaigne, op. cit., 2, 209; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 155; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 175; 51, 272. conjectures that he was himself a Da1sa. This conclusion is not probable, for the Sarasvati1 on which the battle in question took place, and which can hardly be the Haraqaiti of Arachosia, would naturally designate the later Sarasvati1, while the Pa1ra1vatas are mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 12) ix. 4, 11. See Pa1ra1vata. as in the east, about the Yamuna1. Bergaigne's opinion 13) Op. cit., 2, 342 et seq. that Divoda1sa and Atithigva were different people cannot be supported in view of the complete parallelism in the acts of the two persons. 14) Compare, e.g., vii. 19, 8, with ix. 61, 2 (opposed to Turvas4a and Yadu); i. 51, 6; vi. 26, 3, with ii. 19, 6; vi. 31, 4 (defeat of S4ambara); and see Hillebrandt, op. cit., 3, 268; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 210 et seq.; Macdonell, op. cit., p. 161. See also Pratardana. The people of Divoda1sa are referred to in a hymn of the Rigveda. 15) i. 130, 10 (one of the series attributed to Parucchepa). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126; Oldenberg, Buddha, 406; Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 114, 176; Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 604, 837; Keith, ibid., 831 et seq.; 1138 et seq. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., distinguishes two Divoda1sas, one being the ancestor or father of Suda1s, the other the enemy of S4ambara. Divoda1sa is not mentioned in Man2d2alas, iii, v. viii, x.

दिवोदासभैमसेनि
दिवो-दास भैम-सेनि
 (‘descendant of Bhi1masena’) is mentioned in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 1) vii. 1, 8. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 472. as a contemporary of A1run2i.

दिव्य
दिव्य,
 ‘ordeal,’ is a term not found until the later literature, but several references to the practice of ordeals have been seen in Vedic literature. The fire ordeal seen in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 12. by Schlagintweit, 2) Die Gottesurtheile der Indier, 13 et seq. Weber, 3) Indische Studien, 13, 168. Ludwig, 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 445. Zimmer, 5) Altindisches Leben, 184. and others, has been disproved by Grill, 6) Hundert Lieder,^2 45, 87. Bloomfield, 7) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, ccxxi; American Journal of Philology, 11, 334, 335; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 294. and Whitney. 8) Translation of the Atharvaveda. 54. But such an ordeal appears in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 9) xiv. 6, 6. and an ordeal with a glowing axe 10) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 16. occurs in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad as applied in an accusation of theft. Geldner 11) Vedische Studien, 2, 150. suggests that this usage is referred to even in the Rigveda, 12) iii. 53, 22. but this is most improbable. 13) Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 254. Ludwig 14) Op. cit., 4, 44. and Griffith 15) Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 210. discover in another passage of the Rigveda 16) i. 158, 4 et seq. references to Di1rghatamas' having been subjected to the fire and water ordeals, but this view cannot be supported. According to Weber, 17) Indische Streifen, 1, 21; 2, 363. the ‘balance’ ordeal is referred to in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 18) xi. 2, 7, 33. Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 145; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 44, 347, 348; Stenzler, ibid., 9, 669 et seq. but see Tula1.

दिव्यश्वन्
दिव्य श्वन्,
 the ‘divine dog,’ in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 80, 1. appears to denote Canis major or Sirius. But Bloomfield 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 163; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 500, 501. thinks that the two divine dogs referred to in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 3) i. 6, 9. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 4) i. 1, 2, 4-6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 353; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 341. are the sun and moon, and that the sun is meant in the Atharvaveda.

दिश्
दिश्,
 ‘direction,’ is a word very frequently used in the Rigveda and later 1) Rv. i. 124, 3; 183, 5; iii. 30, 12; Av. iii. 31, 4; xi. 2, 12, etc. to denote a quarter of the sky. As a general rule, four quarters are mentioned--east, south, west, north. 2) Rv. vii. 72, 5; x. 36, 14; 42, 11; Av. xv. 2, 1 et seq., etc. But the number of the ‘directions’ is sometimes increased up to ten by the addition to these four of various others. The five points include the zenith (u1rdhva1); 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 15; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 8, 9. the six, the zenith and the nadir (u1rdhva1 and ava1ci1); 4) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 12, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 24; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 2, 4. the seven, the zenith, the ground on which one stands (dhruva1), and the air (antariks2a) between these two (vyadhva1); 5) Rv. ix. 114, 3; Av. iv. 40, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 4, 1, 20; ix. 5, 2, 8; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 7. the eight include the intermediate quarters (S.E., S.W., N.E., N.W.); 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 15; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 1, 40, etc. the nine add to these the zenith; 7) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 28, 2. the ten, zenith and nadir. 8) Rv. i. 164, 14; viii. 101, 13; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 2, 34; viii. 4, 2, 13, etc. The number five is sometimes made up by the ground beneath the observer's feet (dhruva1), 9) Av. viii. 9, 15; xiii. 3, 6; xv. 14, 1-5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 32; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 4, 3, 10, and cf. Dhruva1. and the number six by that point (dhruva1) and the zenith (u1rdhva1); 10) Av. iii. 27, 1; iv. 14, 8; xii. 3, 55; xv. 4, 1 et seq.; xviii. 3, 34; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 14, etc. Cf. Rv. x. 14, 16. the ‘lofty’ (br2hati1) 11) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 13, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 359; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 846; Indische Studien, 17, 293. 294; 18, 153; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. sometimes taking the place of the ‘vertical’ (u1rdhva1).

दीर्घतमस्
दीर्घ-तमस्
 (‘long darkness’) Ma1mateya (‘son of Mamata1’) Aucathya (‘son of Ucatha’) is mentioned as a singer in one hymn of the Rigveda, 1) i. 158, 1. 6. and is referred to in several passages 2) i. 147, 3; 152, 6; iv. 4, 13. In viii. 9, 10, Di1rghatamas is mentioned with Kaks2i1vant, but not as a relative. by his metronymic, Ma1mateya, alone. He is said, both in the Rigveda 1) i. 158, 1. 6. and in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 3) ii. 17; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaha, 14. to have attained the tenth decade of life. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 4) viii. 23. he appears as the priest of Bharata. The Br2haddevata1 5) iv. 11-15; 21-25, with Macdonell's notes. contains a preposterous legend made up of fragments of the Rigveda, 6) From i. 140-164, which hymns are traditionally attributed to Di1rghatamas. But see Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischn Gesellschaft, 42, 221. according to which Di1rghatamas was born blind, but recovered his sight; in old age he was thrown into a river by his servants, one of whom, Traitana, attacked him, but killed himself instead. Carried down by the stream, he was cast up in the An3ga country, where he married Us4ij, a slave girl, and begot Kaks2i1vant. The two legends here combined are not even consistent, for the second ignores Di1rghatamas' recovery of sight. To attach any historical importance to them, as does Pargiter, 7) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. 1910, 44. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig veda, 3, 164, 165; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 226, 232, 247, 268, 279. would seem to be unwise. 

दीर्घनीथ
दीर्घ-नीथ
 appears to be the proper name of a sacrificer in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 50, 10. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Ludwig understands the word as an adjective, meaning ‘of long duration.’

दीर्घश्रवस्
दीर्घ-श्रवस्
 (‘far-famed’) is the name of a royal seer who, according to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xv. 3, 25. having been banished from his kingdom, and suffering from actual hunger, ‘saw’ a certain Sa1man (chant), and thus obtained food. In one passage of the Rigveda 2) i. 112, 11. an Aus4ija, 3) A metronymic, ‘descendant of Us4ij,’ according to Sa1yan2a; but an adjective, meaning ‘desirous,’ according to Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. a merchant (van2ij), is mentioned as di1rgha-s4ravas, which may be a proper name, as Sa1yan2a holds, or an adjective, as it is understood by Roth. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 114.

दीर्घाप्सस्
दीर्घाप्सस्,
 used in the Rigveda 1) i. 122, 15. as an epithet of a chariot, means, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 312. ‘having a long front part.’

दीर्घायुत्व
दीर्घायुत्व,
 ‘longevity,’ is a constant object of the prayers of the Vedic Indians, 1) Rv. x. 62, 2; Av. i. 22, 2, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 9, 1, 13, etc. So the adjective di1rgha1yus, Rv. iv. 15, 9. 10; x. 85, 39; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 100, etc. The Bra1hman2as regularly express the reward for ritual actions by the phrase sarvam a1yur eti, ‘he lives all his days.’ The ideal of life is 100 years. See Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 193; Festgruss an Roth, 137; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 384. and length of life is never deprecated in the Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as, while the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 13; 28; 29; vii. 32, and many other hymns. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 49 et seq.; Atharvaveda, 63-65. is full of spells intended to prolong existence (a1yus2ya1n2i).

दीर्घारण्य
दीर्घारण्य,
 ‘wide tract of forest,’ in the Aitareya 1) iii. 44; vi. 23. and S4atapatha 2) xiii. 3, 7, 10. Bra1hmanas refers to the extensive jungles which must clearly then have covered Northern India. In one of the Aitareya passages 3) iii. 44. it is said that in the east the villages are close together and frequent, while in the west there are forests.

दीव्
दीव्
 (fem.) in the Rigveda 1) x. 27, 17. and the Atharvaveda 2) vii. 50, 9; 109, 5. denotes the ‘game of dice.’ See Aks2a.

दुघा
दुघा,
 ‘yielding milk,’ denotes ‘cow’ in a few passages in the Sam2hita1s. 1) Rv. viii. 50, 3; x. 67, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxviii. 16, 39, etc.

दुन्दुभि
दुन्दुभि,
 apparently an onomatopoetic word, means ‘drum,’ as used in both war and peace. It is often mentioned from the Rigveda 1) i. 28, 5; vi. 47, 29. 31. onwards. 2) Av. v. 20, 1 et seq.; 21, 7; 31, 7; vi. 38, 4; xii. 1, 41; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 6, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 5, 6; dundubhya, ‘connected with the drum,’ Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 35. A special sort of drum was the ‘earth drum,’ made by digging a hole in the ground and covering it with a hide. This was employed in the Maha1vrata, a rite performed at the winter solstice, for the purpose of driving away influences hostile to the return of the sun. 3) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 5 (Indische Studien, 3, 477); S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvii. 14, 11; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 1, 5, with Keith's notes; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 148, n. 2; Friedlaender, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 29, 45. A ‘drumbeater’ is included in the list of sacrificial victims at the Purus2amedha or ‘human sacrifice.’ 4) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 13, 1 (not in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1). Cf. Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 4, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289; and for the epic drum in battle, Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 318.

दुर्
दुर्
 is used several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 68, 10; 113, 4; 121, 4; 188, 5; ii. 2, 7, etc. to denote ‘door,’ both literally and metaphorically. 

दुरोण
दुरोण
 is used in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 1, 18; 25, 5; iv. 13, 1; v. 76, 4, etc. and sometimes later, 2) Av. vii. 17, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxiii. 71, etc. to denote ‘home,’ both literally and metaphorically. See Gr2ha.

दुर्ग
दुर्-ग,
 ‘hard to approach,’ occurs in the Rigveda as a neuter substantive only, sometimes in the sense of ‘fort,’ ‘stronghold.’ 1) v. 34, 7; vii. 25, 2. Cf. Pur.

दुर्गह
दुर्-गह
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 65, 12. where his grandsons are lauded for their generosity, though Sa1yan2a renders the word adjectivally. 2) ‘Plunged in distress’ (duh2kham2 ga1hama1na). In another passage of the Rigveda, 3) iv. 42, 8. however, Sa1yan2a sees in the epithet Daurgaha a description of Purukutsa as Durgaha's son, who was either captured by the enemy or slain, and whose wife, Purukutsa1ni1, then obtained a son, Trasadasyu, to restore the line; he also quotes a story, not found in the Br2haddevata1, 4) As Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., says it is. to support this interpretation. On the other hand, the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 5) xiii. 5, 4, 5. According to the Naighan2t2uka (i. 14), Daurgaha is a synonym of ‘horse.’ seems to take Daurgaha as meaning a horse. Sieg 6) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 96-102. thinks that the same sense should be adopted in the Rigveda passage, which he interprets as referring to the sacrifice of a horse, Daurgaha, by King Purukutsa to gain a son; he also sees in Dadhikra1van, with Pischel 7) Vedische Studien, 1, 124. and Ludwig, 8) Translation of the Rigveda, 4, 79. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 71. a real horse, the charger of Trasadasyu. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a's interpretation of Daurgaha is, however, doubtful, and cannot be regarded as receiving support from the case of Dadhikra1van, who was probably a divinity, and not a real horse at all. 9) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 148, 149. Cf. Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 163, 174; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 301, 302. 

दुर्णामन्
दुर्-णामन्,
 ‘of evil name,’ is the designation in the Rigveda 1) x. 162, 2. and the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 25, 2; viii. 6, 1 et seq.; xvi. 6, 7; xix. 36, 1 et seq. So also the feminine Durn2a1mni1, iv. 17, 5; xix. 36, 6. of a demon causing disease, or the disease itself. The Nirukta 3) vi. 12. explains the words as meaning a ‘worm,’ an interpretation which accords with the widespread belief in disease-causing worms. 4) Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 314 et seq., 351. Later Durna1man denotes ‘hæmorrhoids.’ 5) Sus4ruta, 1, 177, 10, etc.

दुर्मुख
दुर्-मुख,
 ‘ugly-faced,’ is the name, in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) viii. 23. The reading may be a-ra1ja1, ‘not a king,’ but this is not necessary. of a Pa1n5ca1la, that is, Pan5ca1la king, who conquered the world, and whose priest was Br2haduktha.

दुर्य
दुर्य,
 ‘belonging to the door or house,’ appears in several passages of the Sam2hita1s 1) Masculine plural, Rv. i. 91, 19; x. 40, 12; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 3, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 11; feminine plural, Rv. iv. 1, 9. 18; 2, 12; vii. 1, 11. as a plural substantive denoting the ‘door-posts,’ or more generally ‘dwelling.’

दुर्योण
दुर्योण
 occurs a few times in the Rigveda 1) i. 174, 7; v. 29, 10; 32, 8. in the sense of ‘house.’

दुर्वराह
दुर्-वराह
 probably denotes a ‘wild boar.’ It is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xii. 4, 1, 4. and the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 2) i. 51, 4 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 332).

दुला
दुला
 See Naks2atra (Kr2ttika1s).

दुश्चर्मन्
दुश्-चर्मन्,
 ‘afflicted with a skin disease,’ occurs in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) ii. 1, 4, 3; 5, 1, 7. and Bra1hman2a. 2) i. 7, 8, 3. The disease meant is probably leprosy, the usual name of which is Kila1sa. 3) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka v. 4, 12. 

दुःशासु
दुः-शासु
 is possibly a proper name in the Rigveda, 1) x. 33, 1. and would then denote an enemy of Kurus4ravan2a. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. thinks that he was a Pars4u or Persian, but this is most improbable, and the word may simply be an adjective meaning ‘malignant.’

दुःशीम
दुः-शीम
 is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 93, 14. as a generous donor, his patronymic perhaps being Ta1nva. 2) x. 93, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166.

दुष्टरीतु
दुष्-टरीतु,
 ‘hard to defeat,’ is the name of a king of the Sr2n5jayas, who was deposed from a principality that had existed for ten generations, but was re-instated by Ca1kra Sthapati in spite of the resistance of Balhika Pra1tipi1ya, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 205-207.

दुःषन्त
दुः-षन्त
 See Dauh2s2anti.

दुहितृ
दुहितृ
 is the regular designation of ‘daughter’ from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. viii. 101, 15; x. 17, 1; 40, 5; 61, 5, 7; Av. ii. 14, 2; vi. 100, 3; vii. 12, 1; x. 1, 25; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 4, 1; 8, 1, 8, etc. The word appears to be derived from duh, ‘milk,’ in the sense of one who nourishes a child, rather than as the ‘milker’ of the primitive family or the suckling. 2) Delbru7ck, Dic indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 454. See also Stri1, Pati, Pitr2, Bhra1tr2.

दूत
दूत,
 ‘messenger’ or envoy,' is found several times in the Rigveda 1) iii. 3, 2; vi. 8, 4; vii. 3, 3; x. 14, 12. and later, 2) Av. viii. 8, 10, etc.; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 1, 6; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, ii. 1, etc. The feminine form Du1ti1 is found in Rv. x. 108, 2, 3, in the story of Sarama1's mission to the Pan2is. Du1tya, ‘mission,’ occurs in Rv. 1, 12, 4; 161, 1; iv. 7, 8; 8, 4, etc. used metaphorically. The Su1ta seems to have performed the duties later assigned to the Du1ta. 

दूर्वा
दूर्वा,
 a species of grass (Panicum dactylon), is mentioned frequently from the Rigveda 1) x. 16, 13; 134, 5; 142, 8. onwards. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 9, 2; v. 2, 8, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 20; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 5. 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 10, 5; vii. 4, 2, 10, 12, etc. It grew in damp ground. 3) Rv. x. 16, 13; 142, 8. A simile occurring in the Rigveda 4) x. 134, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. seems to indicate that the ears lay horizontal with the stem. Cf. Pa1kadu1rva1.

दूर्श
दूर्श,
 denoting some kind of garment, is mentioned twice in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 7, 6; viii. 6, 11. Weber 2) Indische Studien, 18, 29. thinks that it was worn by the aborigines.

Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 20, 30. it is called dhma1ta, ‘inflated,’ the man afflicted with dropsy being compared with such a bag. Milk (Ks2i1ra) and intoxicating liquor (Sura1) are mentioned as kept in bags. 4) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 11, 26; xvi. 13, 13.

Eggeling 5) Sacred Books of the East, 12, 11 (dr2s2ad-upale, which are here distinguished from ‘mortar and pestle,’ ulu1khala-musale). Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 108, 109. renders them as the large and small millstones. See also Upara and Upala1.

देवकमान्यमान
देवक मान्यमान
 (‘descendant of Manyama1na’) appears in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 20 (devakam2 cin ma1nyama1nam). as an opponent of the Tr2tsus, and as connected with S4ambara. Possibly, however, as Grassmann suggests, the words should be understood as denoting S4ambara, ‘who deemed himself a god,’ devaka being used contemptuously. 2) Cf. Rv. ii. 11. 2 (amartyam2 cid da1sam manyama1nam). Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173.

देवकीपुत्र

 ‘son of Devaki1,’ is the metronymic of Kr2s2n2a in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 1) iii. 17, 6. According to the Epic, 2) Maha1bha1rata, i. 4480; v. 80, etc. a Devaka was father of Devaki1, Kr2s2n2a's mother; the St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that he was the ‘king of the Gandharvas’, also referred to in the Epic. 3) Ibid., i. 2704.

 ‘knowledge of divine beings,’ is one of the sciences enumerated in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 4, 3, 10. Cf. x. 5, 2, 20. and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 2) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1.

देवत्या
देवत्या
 occurs in the text of the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 22, 3. where it must, if the reading is correct, denote some animal. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But the reading should no doubt be rohin2i1-devatya1s, ‘having the red one as deity.’ 3) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 23.

देवन
देवन
 is mentioned once in the Rigveda 1) x. 43, 5. in connexion with dicing. The word must designate the place on which the dice are thrown (elsewhere called Adhidevana), and it is so explained by Durga in his commentary on the Nirukta. 2) v. 22. Cf. Lu7ders, Das Wu7rfelspiel im alten Indien, 14.

देवभागश्रौतर्ष
देव-भाग श्रौतर्ष
 is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 4, 4, 5. This passage is misquoted by Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 81, 3. See Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 9. n.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 152. as the Purohita, or ‘domestic priest,’ of both the Sr2n5jayas and the Kurus. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 2) vii. x. he is said to have taught Girija Ba1bhravya the science of the dissection of the sacrificial animal (pasor vibhakti).

देववन्त्
देववन्त्
 is mentioned in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 22. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 171; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 138. as the ancestor of Suda1s, apparently his grandfather; or if Pijavana be accepted as Suda1s' father, and Divoda1sa as his grandfather, then his great-great-grandfather, and father of Vadhryas4va. The succession in the latter case would then be Devavant, Vadhryas4va, Divoda1sa, Pijavana, Suda1s. 

देववात
देव-वात
 (‘desired of the gods’) is the name of a Bharata prince in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 23, 2. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 409; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218. where he is mentioned as sacrificing on the Dr2s2advati1, Sarasvati1, and A1paya1.

देवातिथिकाण्व
देवातिथि काण्व
 (‘descendant of Kan2va’) is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) ix. 2, 19. as the seer of a Sa1man (chant) by which he turned pumpkins into cows for himself and his son when they were starving in the desert, whither they had been driven by rivals. He is also the reputed author of a hymn of the Rigveda. 2) viii. 4. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 61.

देवापिआर्ष्टिषेण
देवापि आर्ष्टिषेण
 (‘descendant of R2s2t2is2en2a’) is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 98. and in the Nirukta. 2) ii. 10. According to the latter source there were two brothers, Deva1pi and S4antanu, princes of the Kurus. The elder was Deva1pi, but S4antanu got himself anointed king, whereupon no rain fell for twelve years. The drought being attributed by the Brahmins to his having superseded his elder brother, S4antanu offered the kingdom to Deva1pi. The latter, however, refused, but acting as Purohita, or domestic priest, for his brother, obtained rain. The Br2haddevata1 3) vii. 148 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. tells much the same tale, but adds that the reason for Deva1pi's exclusion from the throne was the fact that he suffered from a skin disease. The Epic and later legends further develop the story, presenting two somewhat discrepant accounts. According to the one version, 4) Maha1bha1rata, v. 5054 et seq. (= 149, 15 et seq.), where S4a1ntanu is (as also in the Agni, cclxxvii. 34, the Brahma, xiii. 114, 118, and the Vis2n2u Pura1n2as) the form of the name; Matsya Pura1n2a, l, 39 et seq., in which, as well as in the Bha1gavata, ix. 22, 12, 13, and the Va1yu Pura1n2a, xcix. 234, 237, the form is S4antanu. the ground of Deva1pi's being passed over was leprosy, while in the other his devoting himself to asceticism in his youth was the cause of his brother's taking his place. The Epic, 5) Maha1bha1rata, i. 3751 (= 94, 62); ix. 2285 (= 40, 1); Va1yu Pura1n2a, ii. 37, 230, etc. moreover, treats him as a son of Prati1pa, and names as his brothers Ba1hli1ka 6) Maha1bha1rata, cited in n. 4; Harivam2s4a, 1819. and A1r2s2t2is2en2a, 7) Ibid., cited in n. 5. who is a new figure developed from the patronymic of Deva1pi Possibly Sieg 8) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 136. is right in holding that two stories, those of Deva1pi, Prati1pa's son, and of Deva1pi, R2s2t2is2en2a's son, have been confused; but in any case it is impossible to extract history from them. 9) As does Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 52, 53. The Rigvedic hymn certainly appears to represent Deva1pi as sacrificing for S4antanu, who seems to be called Aula1na. 10) Rv. x. 98, 11. But there is no trace in it of the brotherhood of the two men, nor is there anything to show that Deva1pi was not a Brahmin, but a Ks2atriya. Sieg, 11) Op. cit., 129-142. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 272 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 203; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 192 et seq.; Macdonell, Br2haddevata1, 1, xxix; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 131, 132. who interprets the hymn by the Nirukta, thinks that he was a Ks2atriya, but on this occasion was enabled by the favour of Br2haspati to officiate as priest, and that the hymn shows clear recognition of the unusual character of his action; but this view seems very improbable.

देवृ
देवृ
 is a rare word denoting the wife's ‘brother-in-law’ (that is, the husband's brother). He is included with the sisters of the husband among those over whom the wife of the husband--his elder brother--rules; 1) Rv. x. 85, 46. Cf. Pati. at the same time the wife is to be devoted to him, 2) Rv. x. 85, 44. and friendly to him. 3) Av. xiv. 2, 18. Cf. xiv. 1, 39. After the death of the husband the Devr2 could perform the duty of begetting a son for him. 4) Rv. x. 40, 2. Cf. x. 18, 8; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 51; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 385; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 948. Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 516. No word occurs for the wife's brother corresponding to Devr2.

देश
देश,
 ‘land,’ is a word that does not come into use till the time of the Upanis2ads and Su1tras, 1) Where its use becomes common; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 16; 2, 3; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 14, 6; Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, xv. 4, 17, etc. So the adjective des4i1ya, ‘belonging to a land,’ Ka1tya1yana, xxii. 4, 22; La1t2ya1yana Srauta Su1tra, viii. 6, 28. excepting one occurrence in the latest period of the Bra1hman2a 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 10 (a late passage). literature, and one in a much-discussed passage of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 3) xxxiv. 11. where the Sarasvati1 is mentioned as having five tributaries. This passage militates against the view that Sarasvati1 was a name of the Indus, because the use of Des4a here seems to indicate 4) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 10, who thinks that the word crept into the text, where the Sarasvati1 originally meant the Indus, with the five tributaries of the Panjab. that the seer of the verse placed the Sarasvati1 in the Madhyades4a or ‘Middle Country,’ to which all the geographical data of the Yajurvedas point. 5) Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 174.

देही
देही
 in two passages of the Rigveda 1) vi. 47, 2; vii. 6, 5. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 344; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 143. refers to defences thrown up against an enemy, apparently earthworks or dikes. Cf. Pur.

दैधिषव्य
दैधिषव्य
 is mentioned in a Mantra of the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 1) iii. 2, 4, 4; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 1, 22; Kaus4ika Su1tra, 3, 5; 137, 37. Apparently the word (as derived from Didhis2u1) denotes the son of a younger sister married before the elder sister, 2) American Journal of Philology, 17, 431, n. rather than the son of a woman twice married, the explanation of the St. Petersburg Dictionary. 

दैयांपाति
दैयांपाति,
 ‘descendant of Daya1m2pa1ta,’ is the name of a teacher of the east, who was instructed by S4a1n2d2ilya1yana, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (ix. 5, 1, 14), in the lore of the construction of the fire-altar. The same patronymic is given, in the form of Dayya1m2pa1ti, to Plaks2a, the contemporary of Atyam2has in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (iii. 10, 9, 3-5).

दैव
1. Daiva (masc.) appears in the list of sciences in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 1) vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. where S4an3kara explains it as utpa1tajn5a1na, apparently the ‘knowledge of portents.’ The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that the word is here used adjectivally, and this view is followed by Little 2) Grammatical Index, 83. and by Bo7htlingk in his translation. 3) Though he does not render it (Daiva Nidhi).

दैव
2. Daiva is the patronymic of the mythical Atharvan in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Ma1dhyam2dina).

He is mentioned 1) Rv. iv. 15, 4. as a devotee of the fire cult, and as victorious over the Turvas4a king and the Vr2ci1vants. 2) Rv. vi. 27, 7. According to Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 133, 134. his name was Abhya1vartin Ca1yama1na Pa1rthava (‘descendant of Pr2thu’), but Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105, 106. recognizes this as doubtful, though he none the less places the Sr2n5jayas to the west of the Indus with Divoda1sa. What is more important is to note that the name suggests connexion with the Bharata Devava1ta, and as Kurus and Sr2n5jayas were closely connected 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 4, 5. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 402, 405; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153. this is not immaterial.

Bra1hman2a the name is explained to mean Va1yu, while in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 5) xvii. 1, 7. Cf. vi. 4, 2. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 311; Indische Studien, 3, 220. he seems to be regarded as the author of a Sa1man (chant). He is treated as a R2s2i by the Anukraman2i1, which credits him with the authorship of a hymn of the Rigveda (viii. 96).

 is, according to Sa1yan2a, the name of a prince in the Rigveda. 1) vi. 20, 8. This is probably correct, though the word may also 2) As by Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 380. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. be interpreted as denoting ‘glorification’ but it is not clear what relation existed between Dyotana and the other persons mentioned in the same passage, Vetasu, Das4on2i, Tu1tuji, and Tugra. 

द्रप्स
द्रप्स
 is a common word from the Rigveda onwards 1) Rv. i. 94, 11 (perhaps a ‘drop’ of fire); v. 63, 4 (‘rain-drop’); vii. 33, 11 (= retas); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 2, 6; drapsin (‘thick-flowing’), xi. 4, 1, 15. for a ‘drop’: according to Sa1yan2a, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 1, p. 70, 7. Cf. the epithet uru-drapsa, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 10, 2; Sa1yan2a, on Av. xviii. 4, 18, takes drapsa to mean ‘drops of curd’; so Agnisva1min on La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 2, 4. a ‘thick drop’ as opposed to stoka, a ‘small drop.’ Hence there frequently occurs the expression dadh2i-drapsa,’ ‘drop of curds.’ 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 2, 3, 40. In the Rigveda 4) ix. 78, 4; 85, 10; 89, 2; 97, 56; 108, 8; x. 11, 4; 17, 11. 12. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 9. 1. the word normally denotes the thick drops of Soma or the Soma itself. In two passages 5) iv. 13, 2, and drapsin in i. 64, 2. Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. satvan; Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. drapsa, drapsin. sees the sense of ‘banner,’ which is adopted by Oldenberg. 7) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 357: R2gveda-Noten, 1, 64, 65. Geldner, 8) Vedische Studien, 3, 57, 58; Rigveda, Glossar, 88. on the other hand, considers that ‘dust’ is meant, but this interpretation is not very probable. Max Mu7ller 9) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 104. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 80, with reference to Rv. i. 64, 2. Cf. Macdonell, op. cit., pp. 105, 113. renders the word ‘rain-drop’ in one of the passages.

द्रापि
द्रापि
 occurs several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 25, 13; 116, 10; iv. 33, 2; ix. 86, 14; 100, 9; Av. iii. 13, 1. in the sense of ‘mantle’ or ‘cloak.’ 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 472; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 333. Sa1yan2a, however, renders the word by ‘coat of mail’ 3) Cf. Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 536; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 201, 202. (kavaca). This seems needless, but none of the passages are very decisive one way or the other.

द्रु
द्रु
 denotes a vessel made of wood, 1) Rv. i. 161, 1; v. 86, 3; viii. 66, 11; in x. 101, 10, the mortar seems meant. In v. 86, 3, Bo7htlingk takes it to denote a ‘wooden handle.’ and in particular the vessel used at the Soma sacrifice, 2) ix. 1, 2; 65, 6; 98, 2. perhaps, as Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 191, 192. suggests, to catch the Soma juice when running through the sieve. In the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 4) i. 3, 9, 1. So often in compounds, e.g., Rv. ii. 7, 6; vi. 12, 4, etc. the word simply means ‘wood.’ 

द्रुघण
द्रु-घण
 is found in the Mudgala hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 101, 9. and in the Atharvaveda. 2) vii. 28, 1. The sense is uncertain. Ya1ska 3) Nirukta, ix. 23. renders it as a ‘ghana made of wood,’ probably, as Roth 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. takes it, meaning a ‘club of wood.’ Geldner 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 3, 4. thinks that it was a wooden bull used by Mudgala as a substitute for a second bull when he wanted to join in a race. But this interpretation of the legend is very improbable. 6) Cf. von Bradke, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 46, 462; Bloomfield, ibid., 48, 456; Franke, Vienna Oriental Journal, 8, 342. Whitney 7) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 407. translates the word as ‘tree-smiter’ in the Atharvaveda, quoting Sa1yan2a, who explains it as a ‘cutting instrument,’ so called because trees are struck with it.

द्रुपद
द्रु-पद,
 a ‘wooden pillar’ or ‘post,’ is several times referred to in the Rigveda 1) i. 24, 13; iv. 32, 23. and later. 2) Av. vi. 63, 3; 115, 2; xix. 47, 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 20. S4unah2s4epa was bound to three posts for sacrifice. 3) Rv. i. 24, 13. Thieves, there is some evidence to show, were tied to posts as a penalty for stealing. 4) Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1. Cf. vi. 63, 3 = 84, 4. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 181, 182, and Taskara. n. 26.

द्रुम
द्रुम,
 ‘tree,’ is not found until the later period in the S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a (v. 11) and the Nirukta (iv. 19; v. 26; ix. 23).

द्रुवय
द्रुवय,
 ‘wooden,’ is used in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 20, 2. Cf. xi. 1, 12, where it is an epithet of upas4vasa, ‘blower,’ possibly ‘bellows’; but the manuscripts in part read dhruvaye, and the Paippala1da has druye. as an epithet of the drum.

द्रुहन्
द्रु-हन्,
 ‘wood-cutter,’ seems to be meant by the word druhantara in the Rigveda, 1) i. 127, 2. where it is usually taken as druham2tara, ‘fiend-overpowering.’ But as an epithet of paras4u, ‘axe,’ the other sense (‘mighty wood-cutter’) 2) But if this explanation is correct, the word should have the accentuation of the comparative. See Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 132. is more probable. 3) Cf. Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 130. 

द्रुह्यु
द्रुह्यु
 is the name of a people mentioned several times in the Rigveda. In one passage 1) i. 108, 8. it occurs, in the plural, with the Yadus, Turvas4as, Anus, and Pu1rus, suggesting that these are the famous five peoples of the Rigveda. 2) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 122, 125; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 258 et seq. Again, the Druhyu king shared in the defeat of his allies by Suda1s, and appears to have perished in the waters. 3) vii. 18. In a second passage Druhyu, Anu, Turvas4a, and Yadu are all mentioned in the singular, 4) viii. 10, 5. while in another Pu1ru and Druhyu occur. 5) vi. 46, 8. From the tribal grouping it is probable that the Druhyus were a north-western people, 6) Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 131-133. and the later tradition of the Epic connects Ga1ndha1ra and Druhyu. 7) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 49. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 205; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 140.

द्रोण
द्रोण
 denotes in the Rigveda 1) vi. 2, 8; 37, 2; 44, 20; ix. 93, 1; Nirukta, v. 26. a ‘wooden trough,’ and more specifically it designates in the plural vessels used for holding Soma. 2) ix. 3, 1; 15, 7; 28, 4; 30, 4; 67, 14, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 280. The great wooden reservoir for Soma is called a Dron2a-kalas4a. 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 1, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 21; xix. 27; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17, 32. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 17, etc. The altar was sometimes made in the form of a Dron2a. 4) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 7; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxi. 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 7, 2, 8.

द्रोणाहाव
द्रोणाहाव
 is used as an epithet of Avata, ‘well,’ in the Rigveda, 1) x. 101, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 157. apparently in the sense of ‘having wooden buckets’ with reference to the drawing up of water.

द्वादश
द्वादश,
 ‘consisting of twelve,’ 1) Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 645 et seq. is used of the year in the Rigveda (vii. 103, 9). See Naks2atra.

द्वापर
द्वापर
 See Aks2a and Yuga. 

द्वार्
द्वार्
 is frequently used from the Rigveda 1) i. 13, 6. onwards 2) Av. viii. 3, 22; xiv. 1, 63; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 1, 1, 2; xiv. 3, 1, 13, etc. to denote the ‘door’ of a house. The later form, Dva1ra, has the same sense. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 1, 19; iv. 3, 5, 9; 6, 7, 9; xi. 4, 4, 2, etc. Av. x. 8, 43, has nava-dva1ra, ‘having nine openings,’ of the body. Cf. Gr2ha. The ‘door-fastener’ is called Dva1rapidha1na in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 4) xi. 1, 1, 1. Cf. dva1ra-ba1hu1, ‘doorposts,’ in La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 3, 1; ii. 3, 9.

द्वारप
द्वार-प,
 ‘door-keeper,’ is only found in a metaphorical sense in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (i. 30), where Vis2n2u is called the ‘doorkeeper’ of the gods, and in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (iii. 13, 6).

द्विगत्भार्गव
द्वि-गत् भार्गव
 (‘descendant of Bhr2gu’) is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiv. 9) as the seer of a Sa1man or Chant, by means of which he twice went to the heavenly world.

द्विज
द्वि-ज,
 ‘twice-born,’ as an epithet of the A1ryans generally, or of the Brahmins in particular, is not found in Vedic literature except in a quite obscure verse of the Atharvaveda. 1) xix. 71, 1. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 1008; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 204. Neither dvijanman nor dvi-ja1ti occurs early, and the idea is not in this form an early one.

द्विपाद्
द्वि-पाद्,
 ‘two-footed,’ ‘biped,’ denotes man, as opposed to quadrupeds, from the Rigveda 1) i. 49, 3; iii. 62, 14; viii. 27, 12; x. 97, 20; 117, 8. onwards. 2) Av. ii. 34, 1; x. 1, 24; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 30; ix. 31; xiii. 17; xiv. 8, etc.

द्विबन्धु
द्वि-बन्धु
 is in an obscure hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 61, 17. according to Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary. and Grassmann, 3) Wo7rterbuch, s.v., and Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 475. the name of a man, while Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 643, and 5, 526. renders it as a simple adjective meaning ‘of double kinship.’ 

द्विराज
द्वि-राज
 (neut,), ‘conflict between two kings,’ or ‘battle,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda (v. 20, 9). Cf. Da1s4ara1jn5a.

द्विरेतस्
द्वि-रेतस्,
 ‘having double seed,’ is an epithet of both the ass 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 9; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 3, 1, 23. Cf. Gardabha. and the mare. 2) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 4.

द्वीप
द्वीप,
 ‘island,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 169, 3. and later. 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 2, 1, 3; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su7tra, i. 6, 10. But there is no reason to imagine that the islands referred to were other than sandbanks in the great rivers, Indus or Ganges. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 256. Vedic literature knows nothing of the system of geography according to which the earth consists of four, seven, or thirteen Dvi1pas grouped round Mount Meru.

द्वीपिन्
द्वीपिन्,
 1) Lit., ‘insulated’--i.e., ‘spotted.’ ‘panther’ or ‘leopard,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 8, 7; vi. 38, 2; xix. 49, 4, in every case associated with the tiger. and the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1. 3) ii. 1. 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 80.

द्वैतवन
द्वैत-वन,
 ‘descendant of Dvitavana,’ is the patronymic of Dhvasan, the king of the Matsyas, whose As4vamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xiii. 5, 4, 9).

द्व्योपश
द्व्य्-ओपश
 See Opas4a. DH.

धन
धन,
 ‘prize,’ is often found in the Rigveda, 1) Rv. i. 81, 3; vi. 45, 2; viii. 80, 8; ix. 53, 2; 109, 10. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 120; Pischel, ibid., 1, 171. probably the prize in racing rather than the ‘booty’ in battle. It also denotes 2) Rv. x. 34, 10; Av. iv. 38, 3. the ‘stake’ at dicing. In some passages it possibly means the ‘contest’ itself. 3) Rv. i. 31, 6; v. 35, 7; vii. 38, 8; viii. 5, 26; 8, 21; 49, 9; 50, 9; x. 48, 5, etc. More generally it denotes ‘wealth’ or ‘gift.’ 4) Rv. i. 42, 6; x. 18, 2; 84, 7; Av. i. 15, 3; ii. 7, 4; iii. 15, 2; v. 19, 9; vi. 81, 1; vii. 81, 4; viii. 5, 16, etc. But it sometimes expresses ‘booty,’ 5) Rv. i. 74, 3; 157, 2, etc. probably from the notion of ‘wealth’ rather than of ‘prize.’

धनधानी
धन-धानी,
 a ‘treasure house,’ is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka (x. 67).

धनिष्ठा
धनिष्ठा
 (‘very rich’), used in the plural, is the later name 1) Sa1ntikalpa, 13; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 26. of the lunar mansion (Naks2atra) S4ravis2t2ha1.

धनु
धनु
 (fem.), ‘sandbank,’ occurs several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 33, 4; 144, 5; viii. 3, 19; x. 4, 3; 27, 17. but only metaphorically of the clouds in the atmosphere. Dhanu1 is found in the Atharvaveda, 2) i. 17, 4. where it seems to denote a sandbag used to prevent bleeding. 3) Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 411; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 18; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 259, 260. Cf. Dhanvan.

धनुस्
धनुस्,
 the ‘bow,’ frequently mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 72, 4; 77, 11; ix. 99, 1; x. 18, 9; 125, 6. and later, 2) Av. iv. 4, 6; 6, 6; v. 18, 8; vii. 50. 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 10; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vii. 5, 6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 14; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 4, 6; v. 3, 1, 11, etc. was the chief weapon of the Vedic Indian. 3) Rv. vi. 75, 2. Practically no other weapon plays any substantial part in Vedic warfare. The last act of the funeral rite included the removal of the bow from the right hand of the dead man. 4) Rv. x. 18, 9. The weapon was composed of a stout staff bent into a curved shape (vakra), 5) Av. iv. 6, 4. and of a bowstring (Jya1) made of a strip of cowhide 6) Rv. vi. 75, 11; Av. i. 2, 3. which joined the ends. The tips of the bow, when the string was fastened, were called A1rtni1. Relaxed when not in actual use, the bow was specially strung up when needed for shooting. 7) Rv. x. 166, 3; Av. vi. 42, 1. The stages of the process are given in detail in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1: 8) xvi. 22. the stringing (a1-tan) of the bow, the placing (prati-dha1) of the arrow, the bending (a1-yam) of the bow, and the shooting (as). The arrow was discharged from the ear, 9) Rv. vi. 75, 2 et seq. So also in the Epic, Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 271. The Homeric method is to draw to the breast--e.g., Iliad, iv. 123. and is hence called karn2a-yoni, 10) Rv. ii. 24, 8. ‘having the ear as its point of origin.’ 10) Rv. ii. 24, 8. The making of bows was a regular profession (dhanus2-ka1ra, 11) xxx. 7. dhanus2-kr2t). 12) xvi. 46. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 298, 299; Hopkins, op. cit., 13, 270 et seq. The Epic bow is about 5(1/2) feet, and the arrow 3 feet in length. For the arrow see Is2u, and for the handguard Hastaghna.

धन्वन्
1. Dhanvan, ‘bow,’ is found frequently in the Rigveda 1) ii. 24, 8; 33, 10; vi. 59, 7; 75, 2; viii. 20, 2; ix. 69, 1; Nirukta, ix. 17. and later. 2) Av. i. 3, 9; iv. 4, 7; xi. 9, 1, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 9, etc. It also occurs in the compounds is2u-dhanva, ‘bow and arrow,’ 3) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 19; is2udhanvin, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 2. a1jya-dhanva, 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 25. ‘having clarified butter for its bow,’ 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 1, 1, 6. adhijya-dhanva, ‘bow with string fixed,’ etc. Cf. Dhanus.

धन्वन्
2. Dhanvan, ‘desert,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) ii. 38, 7; iii. 45, 1; iv. 17, 2; 19, 7; 33, 7; v. 53, 6; 83, 10, etc. In i. 116, 4, the strand of the ocean (Samudra) is mentioned. and later. 2) Av. v. 13, 1; vi. 100, 1; vii. 41, 1, etc. Death from thirst in the desert was not rare, 3) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 19. and the value of a spring in the desert was fully appreciated. 4) Rv. x. 4, 1. Cf. vi. 34, 4, etc.; Av. i. 6, 4; xix. 2, 2. The great desert east of the Sindhu (Indus) and the S4utudri1 (Sutlej) is possibly referred to in one hymn of the Rigveda. 5) x. 86, 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 47, 48.

धमनि
धमनि,
 ‘reed,’ appears to denote ‘pipe’ in a passage of the Rigveda 1) ii. 11, 8. and in a citation appearing in the Nirukta. 2) vi. 24. In the Atharvaveda 3) i. 17, 23; ii. 33, 6; vi. 90, 2; vii. 35, 2. Cf. Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 19, 2. it denotes, perhaps, ‘artery’ or ‘vein,’ or more generally ‘intestinal channel,’ being coupled in some passages 4) i. 17, 3; vii. 35, 2. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 259, 546. with Hira1.

धरुण
धरुण
 in one passage of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (viii. 51) denotes a ‘sucking calf.’

धर्म
धर्म,
 1) i. 22, 18; 164, 43, 50; iii. 3, 1; 17, 1; 60, 6; v. 26, 6; 63, 7; 72, 2, etc.; Av. xiv. 1, 51; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 29, etc. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 90. Dharman, 2) Dharma is found in Av. xi. 7, 17; xii. 5, 7; xviii. 3, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 2, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 6; xx. 9; xxx. 6, etc. are the regular words, the latter in the Rigveda, 1) i. 22, 18; 164, 43, 50; iii. 3, 1; 17, 1; 60, 6; v. 26, 6; 63, 7; 72, 2, etc.; Av. xiv. 1, 51; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 29, etc. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 90. and both later, 2) Dharma is found in Av. xi. 7, 17; xii. 5, 7; xviii. 3, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 2, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 6; xx. 9; xxx. 6, etc. for ‘law’ or ‘custom.’ But there is very little evidence in the early literature as to the administration of justice or the code of law followed. On the other hand, the Dharma Su1tras 3) See Jolly, Recht und Sitte; Foy, Die ko7nigliche Gewalt nach den altindischen Rechtsbu7chern; Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 2 and 14. contain full particulars. (1) Criminal Law.--The crimes recognized in Vedic literature vary greatly in importance, while there is no distinction adopted in principle between real crimes and what now are regarded as fanciful bodily defects or infringements of merely conventional practices. 4) Compare the list in Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxi. 7; Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1, xlvii. 7; and Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 11 (see Delbru7ck. Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 579 et seq.), where bodily defects (bad nails and discoloured teeth), marrying a younger daughter when her elder sister was unmarried, are coupled with murder, though not equated with it. See also Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 11, 5, where As4vapati's list of sinners includes a drinker of intoxicating liquor, a thief, and one who does not maintain a sacrificial fire. The crimes enumerated include the slaying of an embryo (bhru1n2a), 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 10, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvii. 9; xxxi. 7; Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1, xli. 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 12; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 7, 8; 8, 3; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 22; Nirukta, vi. 27; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 1. Cf. Av. vi. 112, 3; 113, 2; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 481; 10, 66; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 522; American Journal of Philology, 17, 430. the slaying of a man (vi1ra), 6) Ka1t2haka, xxxi. 7; Kapis2t2hala, loc. cit.; Maitra1yan2i1, loc. cit.; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5, and cf. Vaira. For cases of justifiable homicide, see, e.g., Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, iii. 15-18. Cf. also the story of Vr2s4a Ja1na in Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 12, where the death of a boy by careless driving is mentioned, and the king is reproached for it by his Purohita. They dispute as to the guilt, and, according to one version (see Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 66, 67), the Iks2va1kus decide that the action was sinful, and required expiation. and  the slaying of a Brahmin, 7) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 1, 2; v. 3, 12, 1; vi. 5, 10, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxi. 7 (where the Kapis2t2hala has brahma-jya, ‘oppressor of a Brahmin’); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 12. The Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, x. 38, declares that the slaying of a Brahmin alone is truly murder, and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 1, 1 et seq., states that the sin of murdering a Brahmin can be expiated only by the performance of an As4vamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice’--the ne plus ultra of human generosity to Brahmins. See also Nirukta, vi. 27. The later tradition also interprets bhru1n2a as Brahmin (see San3kara, cited in Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 410, n.; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 30, n. 5; Konow, Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a, 46, n. 1, and cf. Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, xx. 23). a much more serious crime. Treachery is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 8) xiv. 6, 8, the story of Kutsa. as being punishable by death, as it was punished later. 9) Jolly, op. cit., 127. But there is no trace of an organized criminal justice vested either in the king or in the people. There still seems to have prevailed the system of wergeld (Vaira), which indicates that criminal justice remained in the hands of those who were wronged. In the Su1tras, 10) See references in Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 345. on the other hand, the king's peace is recognized as infringed by crimes, a penalty being paid to him, or, according to the Brahminical textbooks, to the Brahmins. It may there fore reasonably be conjectured that the royal power of jurisdiction steadily increased; the references in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a to the king as wielding punishment (Dan2d2a) confirm this supposition. Whether, as the analogy of other systems suggests, the king was assisted in his judicial duties, as he undoubtedly was later, by assessors, presumably of the Brahmin caste, cannot be made out clearly. 11) Compare the story of the death of the child killed by Tryarun2a, and the decision of the Iks2va7kus referred to in n. 6 above, and the notice in Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvii. 4, that a Ra1janya is adhyaks2a, when a Su1dra is punished (han). The procedure adopted in deciding cases is quite uncertain. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 12) vi. 16. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 72, 73. the ordeal of the red-hot axe is mentioned as applied in an accusation of theft. It must apparently be understood to have been inflicted by the direction of the king. But no other judicial ordeal is known to Vedic literature (see Divya). The punishment of theft was in some cases at least death, probably when the thief was taken redhanded; 13) Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xii. 43; A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, i. 9, 25, 4. in other cases binding to posts was the penalty, 14) See Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, and Taskara. presumably accompanied by the return of the stolen goods. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 15) v. 10, 9. Another list is given in Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, x. 65, which includes slaying a Brahmin, defiling a Guru's bed, stealing a cow, drinking Sura1, and killing an embryo, along with irregularities in offering a S4ra1ddha, ‘water offering to the dead.’ Cf. also Nirukta, vi. 27, for a list of seven. Many more appear in the Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a, but that work cannot claim to be a Bra1hman2a proper. the list of sins given as apparently equal in wickedness is stealing gold, drinking spirits, defiling a Guru's bed, and the murder of a Brahmin. (2) Civil Law.--There is little recorded as to civil law in Vedic literature. The relations of the family and the question of family property are dealt with under Urvara1, Ks2etra, Pati; succession and partition of property are treated under Da1ya. As regards the transfer of chattels--for land as transferable inter vivos is hardly yet recognized, save exceptionally as a sacrificial fee (Daks2in2a1), and then disapproved 16) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 7, 1, 13. --the recognized modes are gift (Da1na) and barter or sale (Kraya), which includes exchange. Original acquisition of land was no doubt brought about by occupation and apportionment among the tribesmen, 17) Cf. Cæsar, Bellum Gallicum, iv. 1; vi. 22; Tacitus, Germania, 26, for Germany; Mommsen, Ro7misches Staatsrecht, 3, 1, 21, for the Roman hortus; and the Greek , Lang, Homer and the Epic, 236-241; Ridgeway, Journal of Hellenic Studies, 6, 319 et seq.; Grote, History of Greece, 2, 36, 37. See also Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, 2, 337 et seq.; Baden Powell, Village Communities in India, 6 et seq.; 131. while chattels were acquired by taking possession of them, provided that they were found on one's own land or on unoccupied land, and did not belong to any other person originally. The Su1tras 18) Gautama Dharma Su1tra, x. 36 et seq. contain rules for the disposal of lost property, which tend to give it to the king, with the deduction of a percentage for the finder, unless the latter is a Brahmin, who keeps it all. As for contract, save in regard to moneylending (for which see R2n2a), practically nothing is to be gathered from Vedic literature, doubtless because of the primitive conditions prevailing in that early period. Much of the labour, which would in a more developed society have been done by workers for hire, would be performed by slaves (cf. Da1sa, S4u1dra), while the technical workers of the village--of whom long lists are given in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 19) xxx. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 20) iii. 4. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 426 et seq.; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 75 et seq. --may have been recompensed not by any sum based on each piece of work done, but by fixed allowances, much as the village servants are in modern times. 21) Cf. Maine, Village Communities, 127, 175; Baden Powell, op. cit., 124 et seq.; Grote, History of Greece, 2, 36, n. 2. But this must remain a matter of conjecture, and it is uncertain what exact status the carpenter or smith held in the village. Similarly it is impossible to trace in the early literature any legal theory or practice as to torts, but rules as to penalties for insults appear in the Su1tras. 22) Cf. Jolly, op. cit., 126-128. Very little is recorded as to procedure. The list 23) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 10; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 6, 1. of victims at the Purus2amedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ includes a pras4nin, an abhi-pras4nin, and a pras4na-viva1ka, in whom it is not unreasonable to see the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator or judge: the terms may refer to what is probably an early form of judicial procedure, a voluntary arbitration. The same idea may be conveyed by the word madhyama-s4i1, ‘lying in the midst,’ which occurs in the Rigveda, 24) x. 97, 12 = Av. iv. 9, 4 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 86. Madhyamas4i1van, in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 408, is of quite doubtful sense. and which Roth, 25) Siebenzig Lieder, 174. This fact renders doubtful Lanman's view (Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 159) that the St. Petersburg Dictionary, in giving intercessor as the interpretation, did not mean ‘mediator,’ but ‘adversary.’ followed by Zimmer, 26) Altindisches Leben, 180. understood to mean an arbitrator or judge, the expression being derived from the judge acting with other judicial persons, 27) As, apparently, in early Germany. See Cæsar, Bellum Gallicum, vi. 23; Tacitus, Germania, 11, 12; Coulanges, Recherches sur quelques proble11mes d'histoire, 361 et seq. and being surrounded by the assembly of the people. But this interpretation is uncertain; Whitney 28) See n. 25. thinks that the word merely alludes to a chief round whom his men encamp. The king is later the chief civil judge, and may presumably have been so earlier, no doubt in conjunction with the elders of the tribe, but for this we are reduced to conjecture. 29) Cf. the later Paris2ad, Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xxviii. 48, 49; Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, i. 1, 7-16; Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, xi. 5-7, 20; Jolly, op. cit., 132 et seq. The parallels from other A1ryan peoples suggest the use of assessors, as in the Anglo-Saxon courts of the shire and hundred. Cf. Sohm, Altdeutsches Reichs-und Gerichtsverfassung, 6 et seq. The use of witnesses as evidence is uncertain (see Jn5a1tr2), and the ordeal is not recorded as deciding any civil matter except the dispute between Vatsa and his rival as to the true Brahminical descent of the former, which was settled by his walking unharmed through the flame of a fire. 30) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 6, 6. But it is probable on analogy that the ordeal may have been used for the purpose of deciding disputes. Whether the oath was so used cannot be certainly shown. It appears, however, that a Brahmin was preferred in legal matters to a non-Brahmin. 31) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 11, 9, which seems to refer either to giving evidence for or passing judgment on a case when both a Brahmin and a nonBrahmin are engaged. There are very few references to police officials: no doubt the king employed some of his dependents to execute sentences and arrest offenders (see Ugra, Ji1vagr2bh). (3) Morality.--It is convenient to notice under this head several points bearing on the moral condition of the people: (a) the exposure of children; (b) the exposure of the aged; (c) prostitution; (d) adultery; (e) incest. (a) The exposure of girl infants is asserted by Zimmer 32) Altindisches Leben, 319, 320. Cf. also Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 54, 260; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 49; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 389, 390; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda. 6, 142; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 48. on the strength of a passage in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 33) xxvii. 9. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 10, 3; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 17, 12; Nirukta iii. 4. but it seems clear that the passage has been misunderstood, 34) Bo7htlingk, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 44, 494496. The traditional rendering of the passages is not that it refers to exposure, but to getting rid of a daughter on her marriage. and that it refers merely to laying the child aside, not exposing it, while a boy was lifted up. It is, however, true that the birth of a girl was not at all popular, not an unnatural sentiment in an early society, and paralleled among other A1ryan peoples. 35) Av. viii. 6, 25; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 15; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 409; Zimmer, op. cit., 320; Schrader, op. cit., 390. (b) The exposure of the aged is also inferred by Zimmer 36) Op. cit., 327, 328. Strabo, pp. 513, 517, 520, reports the practice as prevailing in Iran, Bactria, and the Massagetae; it prevailed among the Norsemen, Weinhold, Altuordisches Leben, 473, and conceivably among the early Romans (depontani senes, Cicero, Pro Roscio, 100; but this and other cases may be really instances of the ritual casting into water of the wornout vegetation spirit for the purpose of reviving it). See Kaegi, op. cit., n. 50; Schrader, op. cit., 379, n. from a passage of the Rigveda, 37) viii. 51, 2. and from the mention of persons exposed (ud-hita1h2) in the Atharvaveda. 38) xviii. 2, 34. See Anagnidagdha. The latter passage may well refer merely to the bodies being exposed after death to the elements (as is done by the Parsis). The former passage merely refers to the individual case of some person who may have been cast out, and proves absolutely nothing as to a habitual or recognized custom, nor can such a custom be inferred from, e.g., the legend of Cyava1na. (c) That prostitution existed in Rigvedic times is certain, but its extent is disputed. Brotherless girls were frequently reduced to becoming prostitutes; 39) Rv. i. 124, 7; iv. 5, 5; Av. i. 17, 1; and of. Ayogu7. the putting away of an illegitimate child is referred to in the Rigveda; 40) ii. 29, 1. Cf. Max Mu7ller, op. cit., 26. besides the terms pum2s4cali1 41) Av. xv. 2, etc. and maha1nagni1, 42) Av. xiv. 1, 36; xx. 136, 5 et seq.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 27. Cf. nagna1 in Av. v. 7, 8. which undoubtedly mean ‘harlot,’ there are other clear references to prostitution; 43) Rv. i. 167, 4 (Wilson, Translation of the Rigveda, 2, xvii), can hardly be so interpreted; see Zimmer, op. cit., 332, n. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 277, interprets it as a reference to polyandry, but this is still more doubtful; but see Rv. viii. 17, 7. and expressions like kuma1ri1-putra, ‘son of a maiden,’ 44) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 2, 1. and the ‘son of an unmarried girl’ (agru1), spoken of in the Rigveda 45) iv. 19, 9; 30, 16. 19; ii. 13, 12; 15, 17; Zimmer, op. cit., 334, 335. as exposed and attacked by animals, point in the same direction. The Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 46) Apparently this is meant by the epithets atis2kadvari1 (apaskadvari1 in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 11, 1), ati1tvari1, vijarjara1, in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 15. seems to recognize prostitution as a profession. Pischel 47) Vedische Studien, 1, xxv; 196, 275, 299, 309, etc.; 2, 120. sees many references to Hetairai in the Rigveda, which as Geldner 48) Ibid., 2, 154. insists reflects in its imagery the court life of Indian princes. But the correctness of the view of these two scholars on this point is not by any means certain. 49) Cf. Winternitz, Geschichte der indischen Litteratur, 1, 60; Jolly, op. cit., 48. (d) Adultery was generally regarded among A1ryan peoples as a serious offence against the husband of the woman affected. We accordingly find in the legal literature of India traces of the rule that an adulterer can be slain with impunity if taken in the act. 50) Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 276 et seq., 309. Weber, 51) Indische Studien, 10, 83 et seq. however, has adduced some material indicating an indifference to these matters in Vedic times, and Ludwig 52) Op. cit., 5, 573. has adopted the same view. But, as Delbru7ck 53) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 545 et seq. has clearly shown, the evidence is not convincing; the cited prescriptions 54) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 8, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 7. forbidding connexion with another man's wife during a certain rite do not imply that such connexion would otherwise be allowed: the ritual of the Varun2a-pragha1sas, 55) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 2, 20. when a wife names her lover or lovers, seems originally to have been a solemn means of banishing the evil brought on a family by a wife's fall; Ya1jn5avalkya's famous saying 56) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 1, 21. that no one cares whether a wife is ‘unchaste’ (parah2-pum2sa1) or not is a mere mistranslation, 57) So Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v.; Delbru7ck, op. cit., 548. the expression parah2-pum2sa1 really meaning ‘removed from the male persons.’ And the uncertainty asserted in some passages 58) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 11; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, cited in Ludwig, loc. cit. as to origin from a R2s2i is not a sign of doubtful descent, but is due to the fact that R2s2ihood was a difficult matter to ascertain. None the less woman's position was lowered by the prevalence of polygamy, and such stories as that of Ahalya1 and Indra 59) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 65. are not compatible with a very high standard of morality. A similar conclusion is pointed to by references in the Yajurveda 60) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 19, 2. 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 30. 31. to relations between the A1rya man and the S4u1dra1 woman, and by a spell given in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 61) vi. 4, 11. to expiate relations with the wife of a S4rotriya (Brahmin theologian). (e) Incest was recognized in the marriage of brother and sister as appears from the legend of Yama and Yami1 in the Rigveda, 62) x. 10. which clearly shows that such a marriage was not approved by the feeling of the Vedic age. There is also another hymn 63) x. 162, 5. in which reference to such intercourse appears to be made. Mention is further made in the Rigveda 64) x. 61, 5-7. to the wedlock of Praja1pati and his daughter, which is, however, interpreted mythologically in the Bra1hman2as, 65) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 33; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 4, 1; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 4, 46, 47; Max Mu7ller, op. cit., 529, 530. an interpretation which may be correct. That incest, however, actually did take place is clear from the Atharvaveda; 66) viii. 6, 7. but even though the mythological interpretation of the passage were not justified, no conclusion could be drawn from the hymn as to the normal occurrence of such relations.

धव
1. Dhava is the name of a tree (Grislea tormentosa) mentioned, together with the Plaks2a, As4vattha, and Kha1dira, in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 5, 5; xx. 137, 11. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. 

धव
2. Dhava, ‘man,’ is not found before the Nirukta. 1) iii. 15. Cf. Naighan2t2uka, ii. 3. The word clearly owes its existence merely to vidhava1, ‘widow,’ wrongly interpreted as vi-dhava1, ‘without a husband.’

धवित्र
धवित्र,
 occurring in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiv. 1, 3, 30; 3, 1, 21. and the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, 2) v. 4, 33. denotes a ‘fan’ of hide or leather for blowing the sacrificial fire.

धानंजय्य
धानं-जय्य,
 ‘descendant of Dhanam2-jaya,’ is the patronymic of Am2s4u in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. Under this patronymic he is frequently named by La1t2ya1yana Srauta Su1tra, i. 1, 25; ii. 1, 2; 9, 10, etc. (misread Dha1nam2japya in many manuscripts). Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 76, 77, 82.

धाना
धाना,
 always used in the plural, and frequently referred to in the Rigveda 1) i. 16, 2; iii. 35, 3; 52, 5; vi. 29, 4, etc. and later, 2) Av. xviii. 3, 69; 4, 32. 34; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 21, 22; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 11, 2, etc. means ‘grains of corn.’ They were sometimes parched (bhr2jj), 3) Rv. iv. 24, 7. and were regularly mixed with Soma. 4) Rv. iii. 43, 4; 52, 1; viii. 91, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 10, 2; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 4, 3, 9. Cf. Schrader, Prchistoric Antiquities, 283.

धान्य
धान्य
 (neut.), a derivative from the preceding word, 1) Primarily as an adjective, ‘consisting of grain.’ denotes ‘grain’ in general. It is found in the Rigveda 2) vi. 13, 4. and later. 3) Av. iii. 24, 2. 4; v. 29, 7; vi. 50, 1; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xi. 8; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 5, etc. According to the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 4) vi. 3, 22 (Ma1dhyam2dina = 13 Ka1n2va). there are ten cultivated (gra1mya1n2i) kinds of grain: rice and barley (vri1hiyava1h2), sesamum and beans (tila-ma1s2a1h2), Panicum Miliaceum and Italicum (an2u-priyan3gavah2), maize (godhu1ma1h2), lentils (masu1ra1h2), Khalva1h2 and Dolichos uniflorus (khala-kula1h2). The horse is called ‘corn-eating’ (dha1nya1da) in the Aitareya 5) viii. 21. and S4atapatha 6) xiii. 5, 4, 2. Bra1hman2as, and men are mentioned as ‘purifying corn’ (dha1nya1-kr2t) in the Rigveda. 8) x. 94, 13. 7 Lit., ‘preparing corn.’

धान्व
धान्व
 is the patronymic of Asita in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) xiii. 4, 3, 11; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 7. In the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xvi. 2, 20. the form of the name is Dha1nvana.

धामन्
धामन्
 denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 144, 1; ii. 3, 2; iii. 55, 10; vii. 61, 4; 87, 2; x. 13, 1, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 25, 7; vii. 68, 1; xii. 1, 52; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 34; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 7, 2. ‘dwelling’ and ‘house,’ or sometimes 3) Rv. viii. 101, 6; ix. 63, 14; x. 82, 3; Av. ii. 14, 6. Many of the examples given in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., C, are doubtful. its inmates. The word is also 4) Rv. iv. 55, 2; vi. 21, 3; vii. 63, 3; viii. 41, 10; x. 48, 11. found in the sense of ‘ordinance,’ ‘law,’ expressing much the same as Dharman, especially in conjunction 5) Rv. i. 123, 9; iv. 7, 7; vii. 36, 5; x. 124, 3. with Rta, ‘eternal order.’ Hillebrandt 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 446. sees in one passage 7) Rv. ix. 66, 2. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 92, 93. the sense of Naks2atra.

धारा
धारा
 denotes the ‘edge’ of a weapon, 1) Rv. vi. 3, 5; 47, 10. Cf. viii. 73, 9; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iv. 38, 1, for metaphorical applications. as of an axe (svadhiti), 2) Kaus4ika Su1tra, 44. or of a razor (ks2ura). 3) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 3, 2. See also Asi.

धिषणा
धिषणा,
 according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, denotes 1) Rv. i. 96, 1; 102, 1; 109, 3, 4; iii. 49, 1; iv. 34, 1; 36, 8; viii. 61, 9; ix. 59, 2; x. 17, 12; 30, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 19; vi. 26, 35, etc. an implement used in preparing the Soma, ‘bowl’ or ‘vat,’ and by metonymy also the Soma draught itself. 2) Rv. i. 102, 7; iii. 32, 14; 49, 4; vi. 19, 2; vii. 90, 3; viii. 15, 7; x. 96, 10, etc. The dual, by a metaphor, 3) Like Camu1. also expresses the ‘two worlds,’ heaven and earth. 4) Rv. i. 160, 1; vi. 8, 3; 50, 3; 70, 3; x. 44, 8; in the plural, ‘the three worlds,’ Rv. v. 69, 2. In other passages, Rv. i. 22, 10; iii. 56, 6; v. 41, 8; vi. 11, 3; x. 35, 7, the sense of ‘a genius of prosperity’ was assigned to Dhis2an2a1 by Roth. Hillebrandt, 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 175-181. however, thinks that the word properly means earth, 6) Rv. i. 22, 10; 96, 1; 102, 1; iii. 31, 13; 56, 6; vi. 19, 2; vii. 90, 3; viii. 15, 7; x. 30, 6; 35, 7; 96, 10. in the dual heaven and earth, 7) See n. 3; also Rv. viii. 61, 2; nivid in Sa1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 19, 4. in the plural the triad, earth, atmosphere, and heaven, 8) Rv. iv. 36, 8; v. 69, 2; ix. 59, 2. while in some passages 9) Rv. i. 109, 3, 4; iii. 2, 1; 49, 4 (or perhaps ‘earth’); iv. 34, 1; v. 41, 8; vi. 11, 3; x. 17, 12. Dhis2an2a1 denotes the Vedi, the excavated ground used as an altar. This is not, however, certain, while it seems clear that the Va1jasaneyi 10) vii. 26. and Taittiri1ya 11) iii. 1, 10, 1. Sam2hita1s understand the Dhis2an2a1s (dual) to be the planks over which the pressing of the Soma took place (adhis2avan2a-phalake). 12) Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vii. 26; Sa1yan2a on Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, loc. cit. Pischel 13) Vedische Studien, 2, 82-87. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 124; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 120-122. sees in Dhis2an2a1 a goddess of wealth akin to Aditi and the earth.

 ‘thought,’ is used several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 3, 5; 135, 5; 151, 6; 185, 8; ii. 3, 8 (where it is connected with Sarasvati1); 40, 5, etc. to denote the ‘prayer’ or ‘hymn of praise’ of the singer. One poet speaks of himself as ‘weaving’ such a prayer, 2) Rv. ii. 28, 5. while another refers to his ‘ancient ancestral hymn,’ which he refurbishes presumably for use. 3) Rv. iii. 39, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 338.

धीति
धीति
 has in several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 110, 1; iii. 12, 7; 52, 6; v. 25, 3; 53, 11; vi. 15, 9, etc.; Nirukta, ii. 24. practically the same sense as Dhi1, ‘prayer,’ or ‘hymn of praise.’

धीरशातपर्णेय
धीर शात-पर्णेय
 (‘descendant of S4ataparn2a’) is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (x. 3, 3, 1) as a pupil of Maha1s4a1la. 

धीवन्
धीवन्
 occurs in the Atharvaveda, 1) iii. 5, 6. where it may either be taken with Roth, 2) St. Petersbuig Dictionary, s.v. Bloomfield, 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 114. and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 114. Cf. Weber, Indi1sche Studien, 17, 194 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252. as an epithet of ‘chariot-builders’ (ratha-ka1ra1h2), meaning ‘clever,’ or be construed with the scholiast as denoting ‘fishermen’ (dhi1vara). The Paippala1da recension has taks2a1n2ah2, ‘carpenters.’

धुङ्क्षा
धुङ्क्षा
 is the name of some sort of bird in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 31. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. See also Dhu1n3ks2n2a1 and Dhva1n3ks2a.

धुनि
धुनि
 is the name of a foe of Indra, normally mentioned along with Cumuri in the Rigveda. 1) ii. 15, 9; vi. 18, 8; 20, 13; vii. 19, 4. He and Cumuri seem to have been opposed to Dabhi1ti. 2) Rv. x. 113. 9. His name is probably that of an aboriginal chief. 3) Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xxii; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 162. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 157, 158.

धुर्
धुर्
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 84, 16; 100, 16; 134, 3; 164, 19; ii. 18, 7; iii. 35, 2; v. 55. 6; vii. 34, 4, etc. and later 2) Av. v. 17, 18; Aitareya Bra1hman2a vi. 18; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2 10; 4, 4, 13, etc.; Aitareya A1ran2yaka i. 5, 2 (the Dhur is the end), etc. denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, that part of the yoke which is placed on the shoulders of the animals drawing the chariot or cart, whence they are called dhu1r-s2a1h, ‘yoke-bearing,’ in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 3) iv. 33. Cf. Uara. In one passage of the Rigveda 4) v. 43. 8. the sense is uncertain: Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 2. takes it to mean the pin at either end of the axle (Aks2a) which goes through the nave of the wheel, and would thus be equivalent to A1n2i, and Oldenberg 6) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 339; Griffith. Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 508. The aks2adhurau are mentioned in the A1pastamba Srauta Su1tra, xi. 6, 5; Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, viii. 3, 22. Cf. Caland and Henry. L'Agnis2t2oma, 31. seems to adopt the same view. Monier Williams 7) Dictionary, s.v. seems to think that ‘load’ is meant, but this is not probable. It is possible that Dhur has the sense of ‘pole,’ 8) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 246. Later, the word means the ‘end of the pole,’ a sense already found in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka (n. 2). This modification of meaning seems to be due to the fact that the yoke is at the end of the pole. See also Dhu1rs2ad. and then more generally still the pole and the axle together regarded as the drawing part of the chariot: this might explain the use in the doubtful passage of the Rigveda.

धूङ्क्ष्णा
धूङ्क्ष्णा
 is the form in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) v. 5, 19, 1. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93, gives the form as Dhu1n3ks2n2a. perhaps in error. Cf. also Dhva1n3ks2a. of the name of the bird elsewhere found as Dhun3ks2a1. It is glossed as ‘white crow’ (s4veta-ka1ki1).

धूमकेतु
धूम-केतु,
 ‘smoke-bannered,’ is an epithet of Mr2tyu, ‘death,’ in the Atharvaveda. 1) xix. 9, 10. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 358. thinks that a comet is meant, but Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 914. considers this extremely improbable. Lanman 4) Ibid. plausibly suggests that the smoke of the funeral pile is referred to.

धूम्र
धूम्र
 in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (i. 8, 21, 1) denotes ‘camel’ according to Bo7htlingk's Dictionary.

धूर्षद्
धूर्-षद्
 means, according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. ‘standing under the yoke’ and so ‘burden-bearing,’ and thus metaphorically ‘promoting,’ in the passages of the Rigveda 2) i. 143, 7; ii. 2, 1; 34, 4 (but cf. Pischel. Vedische Studien, 1, 301). In x. 132, 7, Roth renders ‘resting on the yoke.’ where it occurs. More probable, however, is the view 3) Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 237 et seq.; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 195. that it means ‘sitting on the pole,’ that is, ‘charioteer,’ with reference to the fact that to get near his horses the charioteer might well go forward and sit on the pole or even on the yoke. 4) Cf. Maha1bha1rata, viii. 617: dhurya1n dhuryagata1n su1ta1n.

धृतराष्ट्र
1. Dhr2ta-ra1s2t2ra (‘having his kingdom firmly established’) is the name of a snake demon with the patronymic Aira1vata, ‘descendant of Ira1vant,’ in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 10, 29. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 2) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iv. 26, 15; Weber, Indische Studien, 17. 257.

धृतराष्ट्रवैचित्रवीर्य
2. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra Vaicitra-vi1rya (‘descendant of Vicitravi1rya’) is mentioned in a passage of the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 1) x. 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 469 et seq. which is, unhappily, far from intelligible. But there is no ground for supposing that he was a Kuru-Pan5ca1la king; he seems rather to have lived at some distance from the KuruPan5ca1las. There is no good reason to deny his identity 2) As does Weber, Indian Literature, 90, 114, 125; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 7, 8. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., treats them as identical. with the Dhr2tara1s2t2ra of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) xiii. 5, 4, 22. king of Ka1s4i, who was defeated, when he attempted to offer a horse sacrifice, by Sa1tra1jita S4ata1ni1ka. The fact that the latter was a Bharata also points to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's not having been a Kuru-Pan5ca1la at all. In the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 he appears as having a dispute with Vaka Da1lbhi; but even assuming that the latter was a Pan5ca1la, there is nothing to hint that the former was a Kuru or that this dispute is a sign of an early hostility of Kuru and Pan5ca1la. 4) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 831 et seq. This argument is independent of the identification of the two Dhr2tara1s2t2ras, but is confirmed by it. It is true that in the Epic S4antanu and Vicitravi1rya and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra himself are all connected, but this connexion seems to be due, as so often in the Epic, to a confused derangement of great figures of the past.

धृष्टि
धृष्टि,
 found in the dual in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, 1) v. 9, 8. the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) xiv. 3, 1, 22. and the Su1tras, 3) Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxvi. 2, 10, etc. seems to denote ‘firetongs.’ 

धेना
धेना
 denotes a ‘milch cow,’ 1) Rv. iii. 34, 3 (Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 61); v. 62, 2. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 114. or in the plural, ‘draughts of milk.’ 2) Rv. iii. 1, 9; iv. 58, 6, etc. In two passages 3) i. 101, 10; v. 30, 9. Roth 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. takes the word to mean ‘mare,’ and in another the ‘team’ of Va1yu's chariot. Benfey, 6) Orient und Occident, 3, 130. on the other hand, renders it ‘lips’ in one passage, 7) Rv. i. 101. 10. with Sa1yan2a and with Durga's commentary on the Nirukta. 8) vi. 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249. Geldner 9) Vedische Studien, 3, 35-43; 166; Rigveda, Glossar, 95. assigns to the word the senses of ‘lips,’ 10) Rv. i. 101. 10; iii. 1, 9. ‘speech,’ 11) Rv. iv. 58, 6; i. 55, 4; 141, 1; viii. 32, 22; x. 104, 3. 10. ‘cow,’ 12) Rv. v. 62, 2, and Va1yu's cow of plenty, i. 2, 3. ‘beloved,’ 13) Rv. v. 30, 9. and ‘streams.’ 14) Rv. vii. 21, 3; iii. 34, 3. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 441, 442. 5) Rv. i. 2, 3.

धेनु
धेनु
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 9 (saha-vatsa1, ‘with her calf’); 134, 4; ii. 2, 2; 34, 8; vi. 135, 8, etc. and later 2) Av. v. 17, 18; vii. 104. 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 2, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 27; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 1, 21, etc. means ‘milch cow,’ which is often mentioned with special reference to the production of milk, 3) Rv. vii. 33. 22; viii. 14, 3; Av. iv. 34, 8 (ka1ma-dugha1, ‘milking desires,’ the later ‘cow of plenty’ of the Epic); Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 8, 2, 2. and is contrasted with the ‘bull’ (vr2s2abha, 4) Rv. x. 5, 7. puma1m2s, 5) Av. xi. 1, 34. anad2va1h). 6) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 27; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 2, 21. In the plural 7) Rv. iv. 22, 6; viii. 2, 6; 4, 8; ix. 61, 21; 72, 1, etc. the word denotes ‘draughts of milk.’ The derivative, dhenuka1, means merely ‘female.’ 8) Av. iii. 23, 4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. xxv. 10, 23; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 6, etc.

धेनुष्टरी
धेनु-ष्टरी
 in the Ka1t2haka (xiii. 6) and Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (ii. 5, 4) denotes a cow which has ceased to give milk.

धैवर
धैवर
 means a ‘fisherman,’ as a member of a caste, 1) This seems to be shown by the patronymic form, ‘descendant of a dhi1vara.’ in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 16; Tait tiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 15, 1. Cf. Dhi1vara. 

ध्मातृ
ध्मातृ
 (lit. ‘blower’) occurs twice in one passage of the Rigveda 1) v. 9. 5. in the two forms, dhma1ta1, nom. ‘smelter,’ and dhma1tari1, which, according to the Padapa1t2ha, stands for dhma1tari, a locative probably meaning ‘in the smelting furnace.’ 2) Macdonell, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1893, 446. Geldner, 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 146, n, 1. Bartholomae, 4) Indogermanische Forschungen, 1, 496. n. 2. and Oldenburg 5) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 388. regard the latter form as a locative infinitive, ‘in the smelting.’ Ludwig 6) Infinitiv im Veda, 9; Translation of the Rigveda, 4, 334. and Neisser 7) Bezzenberger's Beitra1ge, 20, 40. think dhma1tari1 is a nom. sing. masc. used in the same sense as dhma1ta1. Smelting is also clearly referred to, 8) Rv. iv. 2, 17. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 3. 5, Ayas is smelted from the ore (as4man), and gold from the Ayas. and the smelter is described as using the wings of birds (parn2a s4akuna1na1m) to fan the flame. 9) Rv. ix. 112, 2. That the art was widely applied is shown by the fact that reference is made to arrows with points of Ayas, 10) Cf. I1s2u. to kettles which were fashioned of the same metal and could be placed upon a fire, 11) Rv. v. 30, 15. and to Soma cups of beaten Ayas. 12) Rv. ix. 1, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252; Schrader, Prchistoric Antiquities, 159.

ध्राजि
ध्राजि
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 164. 44; x. 97, 13; 136, 2. and later 2) Av. iii. 1, 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 2, 17; iv. 9, 5 Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i 11, 19, etc. denotes the ‘sweep’ of the wind, referring no doubt to the violent gales which often blow in India devastating the forests, and which figure in the descriptions of the Maruts, or storm gods. 3) Cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, xxxii. xxiii et seq.; Macdonell. Vedic Mythology, p. 79.

ध्रुव
ध्रुव
 in the Su1tras 1) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 7, 22; Sa1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 17, 2 et seq.; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 3, 6, etc. It is to be noted that the marriage Mantras, of which we have a great many, do not include any reference to the Dhruva; but it is not possible to say definitely whether the practice is really an old one or not denotes the pole star, being mentioned in connexion with the marriage ritual, in which the star is pointed out to the bride as an emblem of constancy. In the Maitra1yan2i1 Upanis2ad, 2) See Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 15, 289; Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 396. a late work, the movement of the Dhruva (dhruvasya pracalanam) is mentioned, but this can hardly be interpreted as referring to an actual observed motion of the nominal pole star, 3) As understood by Weber, Indian Literature, 98, n. 103; Bu7hler, Indian Antiquary, 23, 245, n. 21; Jacobi, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 228, n. 2. but rather to an extraordinary event, such as a destruction of the world, as Cowell understood the expression. 4) In his edition of the Upanis2ad, p. 244. Jacobi 5) Indian Antiquary, 23, 157; Zeitschrift, loc. cit., 50, 69 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 721 et seq.; 1910, 461 et seq. sees in the motion of the Dhruva the possibility of fixing a date, on the ground that the only star which could have been deemed a pole star, as ‘immovable,’ was one (a Draconis) of the third millenium B.C. But this attempt to extract chronology from the name of the star is of very doubtful validity. 6) Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xc; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1102; 1910, 465 et seq.

ध्रुवा
ध्रुवा,
 ‘fixed,’ as an epithet of Dis4, ‘cardinal point,’ denotes the ground under one's feet. 1) Av. iii. 27, 5; xii. 3, 59; xv. 6, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 14 (cf. Madhyades4a); Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 9, 25, etc.

ध्वज
ध्वज
 occurs twice in the Rigveda 1) vii. 85, 2; x. 103, 11. In Epic warfare banners are of vast importance -e.g., Ra1ma1yan2a, ii. 67, 26; they were attached to a pole on the chariot, Mahabha1rata, vii. 3332, etc. The army was called dhvajini1, ‘bannered host,’ ibid., i. 2875, etc. in the sense of ‘banner’ used in battle. It is characteristic of Vedic fighting that in both passages reference is made to arrows being discharged and falling on the banners.

ध्वन्य
ध्वन्य
 is apparently the name of a patron, son of Laks2man2a, in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) v. 33, 10. Cf. Ludwig Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155. 

ध्वसन्द्वैतवन
ध्वसन् द्वैत-वन
 (‘descendant of Dvitavana’) is the name in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 5, 4, 9. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 211; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 6. of the king of the Matsyas who celebrated an As4vamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ near the Sarasvati1.

ध्वसन्ति
ध्वसन्ति
 is in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 23. mentioned together with Purus2anti as having been aided by the As4vins. There can be no doubt that this is the longer form of the name Dhvasra, which is found with Purus2anti both in the Rigveda 2) ix. 58. 3 = Sv. ii. 409. and in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) xiii. 7, 12 (where the dual of Dhvasra appears as a feminine Dhvasre). Cf. Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 62, 63; Benfey, Sa1maveda, 105, 126, who is inclined to think that Dhvasanti and Purus2anti are names of women.

ध्वस्र
ध्वस्र
 is named with Purus2anti in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 7, 12. Cf. Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 139; Sa1t2ya1yanaka, apud Sa1yan2a, on Rv. ix. 58, 3. as giving gifts to Taranta and Purumi1d2ha. These two, being kings, could not 2) Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra, x. 75, 77. properly accept gifts which Bra1hman2as alone could accept, but by becoming authors of a verse of the Rigveda 3) ix. 58, 3. they qualified themselves to accept them. The verse mentions the names in the dual as Dhvasrayoh2 Purus2antyoh2, ‘from the two, Dhvasra and Purus2anti.’ 4) Both words are in the dual, as if they were members of a Dvandva compound. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 261. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 5) Loc. cit. the names occur in the dual as Dhvasre Purus2anti1, a reading which is confirmed by the Nida1na Su1tra. 6) ix. 9. The former is necessarily a feminine form, though Sa1yan2a, in his comment on the passage, explains it as really an irregular masculine. According to Roth, 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. dhvasra. the feminine is a corruption based on the dual form in the verse of the Rigveda mentioned above; but the names may be those of women, 8) The first would in that case be Dhvasra1. as Benfey 9) Sa1maveda, 105. 126, under Dhvasanti and Purus2anti. inclines to believe. Weber 10) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27, n. 1. suggests that the two were demons, but this is, as Sieg 11) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 62, 63. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139; Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 39; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 360, points out that the sense of the Ri1gveda passage is quite uncertain, and that the two, Taranta and Purumi1l2ha, as they appear in Rv. v. 61, are rather donors than receivers (see, however, verse 9, Purumi1t2ha1ya vipra1va). See also Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 232; R2gveda-Noteu, 1, 354. shows, quite unnecessary. Dhvasra is no doubt identical with Dhvasanti.

ध्वाङ्क्ष
ध्वाङ्क्ष,
 ‘crow,’ is mentioned twice in the Atharvaveda, 1) xi. 9, 9; xii. 4, 8. and in the Su1tras. 2) Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra xxv. 6, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 88. Possibly the same bird is meant by the words Dhun3ks2a1 and Dhu1n3ksna1.

ध्वान्त
ध्वान्त
 is the name of some wind in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 7, 7, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxix. 7. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 16, 1; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iv. 24, 1; 25, 1. N.

नकुल
नकुल,
 ‘ichneumon,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 139, 5. as being able to cut a snake in two and then join it up again. Its knowledge 2) Av. viii. 7, 23. of a remedy against snake poison is also mentioned. The animal figures in the list of sacrificial victims at the As4vamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 12, 1; 21, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 26. 2; Mai1tra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 7 In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 3, 18, 1; R2gveda Pra1tis4a1khya, xvii. 9, nakula denotes a colour--no doubt that of the ichneumon. 

नक्त
नक्त,
 ‘night,’ is found frequently in the Rigveda, 1) i. 13, 7; 73, 7; 96, 5; vii. 2, 6; x. 70, 6; adverbially, i. 24, 10; 90, 7; v. 76, 3; vii. 15, 15; 104, 17; viii. 96, 1. and sometimes later, 2) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 4, 2, adverbially, Av. vi. 128, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 4, 2; xiii. 1, 5, 5, etc. usually in the adverbial form naktam2, ‘by night’

नक्षत्र
नक्षत्र
 is a word of obscure origin and derivation. The Indian interpreters already show a great divergence of opinion as to its primary meaning. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 1, 2, 18. 19. Cf. a citation in Nirukta, iii. 20. resolves it into na-ks2atra (‘no power’), explaining it by a legend. The Nirukta 2) Loc. cit., and of. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. refers it to the root naks2, ‘obtain,’ following the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 3) i. 5, 2, 5. Aufrecht 4) Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 8, 71, 72. So Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 288, n. 2. and Weber 5) Naxatra, 2, 268. derived it from nakta-tra, ‘guardian of night,’ and more recently 6) Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 74. line 8. the derivation from nak-ks2atra, ‘having rule over night,’ seems to be gaining acceptance. The generic meaning of the word therefore seems to be ‘star.’ The Naks2atras as Stars in the Rigveda and Later.--The sense of ‘star’ appears to be adequate for all or nearly all the passages in which Naks2atra occurs in the Rigveda. 7) See i. 50, 2; vii. 86, 1; x. 68, 11; 111, 7; used of the sun itself, vi. 67, 6 (as masculine); vii. 81, 2; x. 88, 13. The sun is allied with them, iii. 54, 19. Naks2atra-s4avas, ‘equalling the multitude of the stars,’ is used as an epithet in x. 21, 10. Even in x. 85, 2, where Soma, on the lap of the Naks2atras, is mentioned, ‘stars’ would do; but, as this hymn refers to two of the later Naks2atras, ‘lunar mansions’ may well be meant. The same sense occurs in the later Sam2hita1s also: the sun and the Naks2atras are mentioned together, 8) Av. vi. 10, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 43; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, x. 1, 1; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iv. 10, 12. or the sun, the moon, and the Naks2atras, 9) Av. vi. 128, 3; xv. 6, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 13, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 29, etc. or the moon and the Naks2atras, 10) Av. v. 24, 10; vi. 86, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 5, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxv. 15; xxxvii. 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 21; xxxix. 2, etc. or the Naks2atras alone; 11) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 2, 2, 2; ii 6, 2, 6, etc; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 21 etc.; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, As4vamedha, v. 5, and very often elsewhere. but there is no necessity to attribute to the word the sense of ‘lunar mansion’ in these passages. On the other hand, the names of at least three of the Naks2atras in the later sense occur in the Rigveda. Tis2ya, 12) Rv. v. 59, 13; x. 64, 8; Weber, 2, 290. however, does not seem to be mentioned as a lunar mansion. With Agha1s (plur.) and Arjuni1 (dual) 13) x. 85, 13; Weber, 364-367, and see references under Agha1 and Arjuni1. the case is different: it seems probable that they are the later lunar mansions called Magha1s (plur.) and Phalguni1 (dual). The names appear to have been deliberately changed in the Rigveda, and it must be remembered that the hymn in which they occur, the wedding hymn of Su1rya1, has no claim to great age. 14) Cf. Arnold, Vedic Metre, 322. Ludwig 15) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 184 et seq. and Zimmer 16) Altindisches Leben, 354. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 158. have seen other references to the Naks2atras as 27 in the Rigveda, 17) i. 162, 18 (the 34 ribs of the horse = moon, sun, 5 planets, 27 Naks2atras); x. 55, 3 (34 lights). but these seem most improbable. Nor do the adjectives revati1 (‘rich’) and punarvasa1 (‘bringing wealth again’) in another hymn 18) x. 19, 1. appear to refer to the Naks2atras. The Naks2atras as Lunar Mansions.--In several passages of the later Sam2hita1s the connexion of the moon and the Naks2atras is conceived of as a marriage union. Thus in the Ka1t2haka 19) xi. 3 (Indische Studien, 3, 467). and Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1s 20) ii. 3, 5, 1-3. Cf. also iii. 4, 7. 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xviii. 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 40; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 4, 1, 9; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iii. 12. The dwelling of the moon in a Naks2atra is mentioned, S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 5, 4, 17; Nirukta, v. 21; a Mantra in Kaus4ika Su1tra, 135; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 11, 6; v. 12, 1, etc. it is expressly stated that Soma was wedded to the mansions, but dwelt only with Rohin2i1; the others being angry, he had ultimately to undertake to live with them all equally. Weber 21) Op. cit., 277. Cf. the later system of the Siddha1ntas, Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Studies, 2, 372, and see Tilak, Orion, 33 et seq. hence deduced that the Naks2atras were regarded as of equal extent, but this is to press the texts unduly, except in the sense of approximate equality. The number of the mansions is not stated as 27 in the story told in the two Sam2hita1s: the Taitti1riya has 33, and the Ka1t2haka no number; but 27 appears as their number in the list which is found in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 22) iv. 4, 10, 1-3. and elsewhere. 23) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxix. 13, but Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 13, 20, has 28; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 1, 1-5, in lists of Naks2atras. See also Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 5, 4, 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiii, 23; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 1; Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, ii. 16; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 2, 2; Jyotis2a, 18. 20 (verse 34 has 28, but it is interpolated); S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiv. 78, etc. The number 28 is much less well attested: in one passage of the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 24) i. 5, 2, 3. Cf. Weber, 1, 360, n. Abhijit is practically marked as a new comer, though in a later book, 25) iii. 1, 2, 6. in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 26) ii. 13, 20. and in the Atharvaveda list, 27) xix. 7, 1; 8, 1 = Naks2atrakalpa, 10. 26. So in S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 26. it has found acceptance. It is perfectly possible that 28 is the earlier number, and that Abhijit dropped out because it was faint, or too far north, or because 27 was a more mystic (3×3×3) number: it is significant that the Chinese Sieou and the Arabic Mana1zil are 28 in number. 28) Whitney, op. cit., 409-411; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 390. Weber, 29) Op. cit., 2, 280; Indische Studien, 9, 446; 10, 223, 224, 226, 227. however, believes that 27 is the older number in India. The meaning of the number is easily explained when it is remembered that a periodic month occupies something between 27 and 28 days, more nearly the former number. Such a month is in fact recognized in the La1t2ya1yana 30) iv. 8, 1 et seq. and Nida1na Su1tras 31) v. 11. 12. See Weber, 2, 281288. as consisting of 27 days, 12 months making a year of 324 days, a Naks2atra year, or with an intercalary month, a year of 351 days. The Nida1na Su1tra 32) Thibaut, Astronomic, Astrologie und Mathematik, 7. makes an attempt to introduce the Naks2atra reckoning into the civil or solar (sa1vana) year of 360 days, for it holds that the sun spends 13(1/3) days in each Naks2atra (13(1/3)×27 = 360). But the month of 27 or 28 days plays no part in the chronological calculations of the Veda. 33) See Ma1sa. The Names of the Naks2atras.--In addition to the two mentioned in the Rigveda, the earlier Atharvaveda 34) l. e., books i. xvi. gives the names of Jyes2t2haghni1 35) vi. 110, 2. This constellation, ‘the slayer of the oldest,’ was apparently of evil omen. Cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 2, 8. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 361, equates it with Antares or Cor Scorpionis, with or without , Scorpionis (Jyai1s2t2haghni1 is a misreading in the edition of Whitney and Roth). (the later Jyes2t2ha1) and Vicr2tau, 36) vi. 110, 2. It is also mentioned in ii. 8, 1; iii. 7, 4; vi. 121, 3. It is identified by the commentators with Mu1la, ‘the root,’ the two stars,  and  Scorpionis, which form the sting of the Scorpion's tail; Whitney, op. cit., 48. which are mentioned as in close connexion, and of Revati1s (plural) and Kr2ttika1s. 37) ix. 7, 3. With reference to possible times for the ceremony of the Agnya1dha1na, or ‘laying of the sacred fires,’ the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 38) viii. 1. the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 39) i. 6, 9. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 40) i. 1, 2, 1-6. mention the Naks2atras called Kr2ttika1s, Rohin2i1, Phalgunyas, Hasta; the latter Bra1hman2a adds Punarvasu1, and in an additional remark 41) i. 1, 2, 8. excludes Pu1rve Phalguni1 in favour of Uttare Phalguni1. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 42) ii. 1, 2, 1. adds Mr2gas4i1rs2a and Citra1 as possibilities. On the other hand, Punarvasu1 is recommended by all authorities 43) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 1, 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 7, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 15; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 2, 10; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, i. 3. as suitable for the Punara1dheya, ‘relaying of the sacred fires,’ which takes place if the first fire has failed to effect the aim of its existence, the prosperity of the sacrificer. 44) Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 109. The Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 45) viii. 15; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1. i. 7, 2. however, allows Anura1dha1s also. In the ceremony of the Agnicayana, or ‘piling of the firealtar,’ the bricks are assumed to be equal in number to the Naks2atras. The bricks number 756, and they are equated to 27 Naks2atras multiplied by 27 secondary Naks2atras, reckoned as 720 (instead of 729), with the addition of 36 days, the length of an intercalary month. Nothing can be usefully derived from this piece of priestly nonsense. 46) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 5, 4, 5. See Weber, 2, 298, with whom Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 42, 383, n. 1, concurs. For a wild speculation, see Shamasastry, Gavam ayana, 122 et seq. But in connexion with this ceremony the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 47) Taittiriya Samhita1, iv. 4, 10. 1-3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 13, 20; Ka1tnaka Sam2hita1, xxxix. 13. enumerate the 27 Naks2atras, and these lists 48) The forms and genders are given as accepted by Weber, 2, 300. The latter depend on references to the names of the Naks2atras in other passages in some cases--e.g., Anu1ra1dhes2u, in Ka1t2haka, viii. 15, shows that the name is a masculine in that Sam2hita1. may be given in extenso as follows: Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1.

Apabharan2i1s The Taittiri1ya Brahman2a 49) i. 5, 1 has a list of the Naks2atras which agrees generally with the list of the Sam2hita1s. It runs as follows: Kr2ttika1s, Rohin2i1, Invaka1s, Ba1hu1 (dual), Tis2ya, A1s4les2a1s, Magha1s, Pu1rve Phalguni1, Uttare Phalguni1, Hasta, Citra1, Nis2t2ya1, Vis4a1khe, Anu1ra1dha1s, Rohin2i1, Mu1labarhan2i1, Pu1rva1 As2a1d2ha1s, Uttara1 As2a1d2ha1s, S4ron2a1, S4ravis2t2ha1s, S4atabhis2aj, Pu1rve Pros2t2hapada1s, Uttare Pros2t2hapada1s, Revati1, As4vayujau, Apabharan2i1s. In a later book, 50) iii. 1, 4, 1 et seq. Cf. iii. 1, 1-2. however, the list grows to 28, and the full moon is inserted after number 14, and the new moon after number 28, as an attempt to bring the Na1ks2atra (lunar) month into accordance with the Sa1vana (solar) month of 30 days. The names in this second list are as in the Sam2hita1s with the following exceptions. The seven stars of the Kr2ttika1s are named as Amba1, Dula1, Nitatni1, Abhrayanti1, Meghayanti1, Vars2ayanti1, Cupun2i1ka1, names found also in the Taittiri1ya 51) iv. 4, 5, 1. and Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1s. 52) xl. 4. Beside Mr2gas4i1rs2a, Invaka1s are also mentioned. 53) iii. 1, 4, 3. Then come A1rdra1, Punarvasu1, Tis2ya, A1s4res2a1s, Magha1s (beside which Anagha1s, Agada1s, and Arundhati1s are also mentioned), Phalgunyas (but elsewhere in the dual, Phalgunyau), 54) iii. 1, 4, 9. Phalgunyas, Hasta, Citra1, Nis2t2ya1, Vis4a1khe, Anu1ra1dha1s, Jyes2t2ha1, Mu1la, As2a1d2ha1s, As2a1d2ha1s, Abhijit, S4rona1, S4ravis2t2ha1s, S4atabhis2aj, Pros2t2hapada1s, Pros2t2hapada1s, Revati1, As4vayujau, Bharan2yas, but also Apabharan2i1s. 55) iii. 1, 5, 14. Abhijit, which occurs also in an earlier part of the Bra1hman2a, 56) i. 5, 2, 3. is perhaps interpolated. But Weber's 57) Op. cit., 305, 306. argument that Abhijit is out of place in this list because Bra1hman2a is here mentioned as the 28th Naks2atra, loses some force from the fact (of course unknown to him) that the list in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 58) ii. 13, 20. contains 28 Naks2atras, including Abhijit, and adds Bra1hman2a at the end as another. In another passage 59) i. 5, 2, 7. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 41 et seq. the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a divides the Naks2atras into two sets, the Deva Naks2atras and the Yama Naks2atras, being 1-14 and 15-27 (with the omission of Abhijit) respectively. This division corresponds with one in the third book of the Bra1hman2a 60) iii. 1, 2. Cf. Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iv. 12, with Vina1yaka's note. where the days of the light half of the month and those of the dark half are equated with the Naks2atras. The Bra1hman2a treats the former series as south, the latter as north; but this has no relation to facts, and can only be regarded as a ritual absurdity. The late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda contains a list 61) xix. 7, 1 et seq. The number is given as 28 in xix. 7, 1 (as emended) and 8, 2. Cf. Lanman's introductory note to the former hymn in Whitney's Translation, 906, 907. of the Naks2atras, including Abhijit. The names here given are: Kr2ttika1s, Rohin2i1, Mr2gas4iras, A1rdra1, Punarvasu1, Pus2ya, A1s4les2a1s, Magha1s, Pu1rva1 Phalgunyau (sic), 62) The reading Pu1rva1 Phalgunyau must be wrong; perhaps Dvaye (cf. verse 5) or Pu1rve should be read. See Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 908. The Uttare Phalgunyau are omitted. Hasta, Citra1, Sva1ti (masc.), 63) Sva1ti1 should, no doubt, be read; but for the Sva1ti (sie) of all the manuscripts (Sam2hita1 and Pada), cf. the navasrakti of the Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 3, 6, with Keith's note. Vis4a1khe, Anura1dha1, 64) See Lanman in Whitney, 908. Jyes2t2ha1, Mu1la, Pu1rva1 As2a1d2ha1s, 65) Lanman, ibid., 909. reads Pu1rva1 As2a1d2ha1 and Uttara1 As2a1d2ha1; Whitney reads Pu1rva1 and Uttara1 As2a1d2ha1s. The manuscripts have Pu1rva1 and Uttare, which cannot stand. Uttara1 As2a1d2ha1s, Abhijit, S4ravan2a, S4ravis2t2ha1s, S4atabhis2aj, Dvaya1 Pros2t2hapada1, Revati1, As4vayujau, Bharan2yas. The Position of the Naks2atras.--There is nothing definite in Vedic literature regarding the position of most of the Naks2atras, but the later astronomy precisely locates all of them, and its statements agree on the whole satisfactorily with what is said in the earlier texts, though Weber 66) Op. cit., 2, 367 et seq. was inclined to doubt this. The determinations adopted below are due to Whitney 67) Oriental and Linguis'tic Essays, 2, 350 et seq. in his notes on the Su1rya Siddha1nta.

कृत्तिकास्
1. Kr2ttika1s are unquestionably  Tauri, etc., the Pleiades. The names of the seven stars forming this constellation, and given above from Yajurveda texts, 68) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 5, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xl. 4; Taitti1ri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 4, 1. include three--abhrayanti1, ‘forming clouds’; meghayanti1, ‘making cloudy’; vars2ayanti1, ‘causing rain’--which clearly refer to the rainy Pleiades. The word kr2ttika1 possibly means ‘web,’ from the root kr2t, ‘spin.’

रोहिणी
2. Rohin2i1, ‘ruddy,’ is the name of the conspicuously reddish star, a Tauri or Aldebaran, and denotes the group of the Hyades,  Tauri. Its identification seems absolutely assured by the legend of Praja1pati in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 69) iii. 33. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 2, 8; Tilak, Orion, 98 et seq. He is there represented as pursuing his daughter with incestuous intention, and as having been shot with an arrow (Is2u Trika1n2d2a1, ‘the belt of Orion’) by the ‘huntsman’ (Mr2gavya1dha, ‘Sirius’). Praja1pati is clearly Orion (Mr2gas4iras being the name of the little group of stars in Orion's head).

मृगशीर्ष
3. Mr2gas4i1rs2a or Mr2gas4iras, also called Invaka1 or Invaga1, seems to be the faint stars , Orionis. They are called Andhaka1, ‘blind,’ in the S4a1ntikalpa of the Atharvaveda, probably because of their dimness. 70) Whitney, op. cit., 401. Cf. Tilak, 102 et seq.

आर्द्रा
4. A1rdra1, ‘moist,’ is the name of the brilliant star,  Orionis. But the names by which it is styled, in the plural as A1rdra1s in the S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra 71) i. 26. and the Naks2atrakalpa, 72) 10. and in the dual as Ba1hu1, in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 73) i. 5, 1. point to a constellation of two or more stars, and it may be noted 74) Whitney, op. cit., 352, 401, n. 1. that the corresponding Chinese Sieou includes the seven brilliant stars composing the shoulders, the belt, and the knees of Orion.

पुनर्वसू
5. Punarvasu1, ‘the two that give wealth again,’ denotes the two stars,  and  Geminorum, on the heads of Castor and Pollux. The name is no doubt connected with the beneficent character of the As4vins, who correspond to the Dioscuri. 75) Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 212; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 53.

तिष्य
6. Tis2ya or Pus2ya includes the somewhat faint group in the body of the Crab, , and  Cancri. The singular is rather curious, as primarily one star would seem to have been meant. and none of the group is at all prominent. 76) Whitney, op. cit., 403, n. 1.

आश्रेषास्
7. A1s4res2a1s or A1s4les2a1s, which in some texts 77) As4res2a1s, S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 26; S4a1ntikalpa; Naks2atrakalpa; As4les2a1s, S4a1ntikalpa, 2; Naks2atrakalpa, 4. 48. is certainly to be read As4res2a1s or As4les2as, denotes , and perhaps also , Hydræ. The word means ‘embracer,’ a name which admirably fits the constellation.

मघास्
8. Magha1s, the ‘bounties,’ are the Sickle, or , Leonis. The variants Anagha1, the ‘sinless one,’ etc., clearly refer to the auspicious influence of the constellation. 9, 10. Phalguni1, Phalgunyau, Phalgu1, 78) Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 1. Phalguni1s, Phalgunyas, is really a-double constellation, divided into Pu1rve, ‘former,’ and Uttare, ‘latter.’ The former is  and  Leonis, the latter  and 93 Leonis. According to Weber, the word denotes, like Arjuni1, the variant of the Rigveda, 79) x. 85, 13. a ‘brightcoloured’ constellation. 

हस्त
11. Hasta, ‘hand,’ is made up of the five conspicuous stars () in Corvus, a number which the word itself suggests. According to Geldner, 80) Vedische Studien, 3, 177; Rv. i. 105, 10. Cf. below, p. 427, n. 156. the ‘five bulls’ of the Rigveda are this constellation.

चित्रा
12. Citra1, ‘bright,’ is the beautiful star,  Virginis. It is mentioned in a legend of Indra in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 81) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 4-6. and in that of the ‘two divine dogs’ (divyau s4va1nau) in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 82) ii. 1, 2, 13-17.

स्वाती
13. Sva1ti1 or Nis2t2ya1 is later clearly the brilliant star Arcturus or  Bootis, its place in the north being assured by the notice in the S4a1ntikalpa, 83) 3. where it is said to be ‘ever traversing the northern way’ (nityam uttara-ma1rgagam). The Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 84) i. 5, 2. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 204. however, constructs an asterismal Praja1pati, giving him Citra1 (a Virginis) for head, Hasta (Corvus) for hand, the Vis4a1khe (a and  Libræ) for thighs, and the Anura1dha1s (, and  Scorpionis) for standing place, with Nis2t2ya1 for heart. But Arcturus, being 30º out, spoils this figure, while, on the other hand, the Arabic and Chinese systems have respectively, instead of Arcturus, , and  Virginis and  Virginis, which would well fit into the Praja1pati figure. But in spite of the force of this argument of Weber's, 85) Op. cit., 2, 307, 308. Whitney 86) Op. cit., 409. is not certain that Nis2t2ya1 here must mean a star in Virgo, pointing out that the name Nis2t2ya1, ‘outcast,’ suggests the separation of this Naks2atra from the others in question.

विशाखे
14. Vis4a1khe is the couple of stars  and  Libræ. This mansion is later called Ra1dha1 according to the Amarakos4a, and it is curious that in the Atharvaveda 87) xix. 7. the expression ra1dho Vis4a1khe, ‘the Vis4a1khe are prosperity,’ should occur. But probably Ra1dha1 is merely an invention due to the name of the next Naks2atra, Anura1dha1, wrongly conceived as meaning ‘that which is after or follows Ra1dha1.’ 88) Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 908.

Abhijit is said to be ‘over As2a1d2ha1s, under S4ron2a1,’ which Weber 94) Op. cit., 1, 320, 321; 2, 307; Indische Studien, 10, 224 et seq. held to refer to its position in space, inferring thence that its Vedic position corresponded to that of the Arab Mana1zil and the Chinese Sieou--viz., , Capricorni. But Whitney 95) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 393. argues effectively that the words ‘over’ and ‘under’ really refer to the place of Abhijit in the list, ‘after’ As2a1d2ha1s and ‘before’ S4ron2a1.

The Naks2atras and the Months.--In the Bra1hman2as the Naks2atra names are regularly used to denote dates. This is done in two ways. The name, if not already a feminine, may be turned into a feminine and compounded with pu1rn2a-ma1sa, ‘the full moon,’ as in Tis2ya1-pu1rn2ama1sa, ‘the full moon in the Naks2atra Tis2ya.’ 103) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 10, 1. Cf. vii. 4, 8, 1. 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 9, 1. Much more often, however, it is turned into a derivative adjective, used with paurn2ama1si1, ‘the full moon (night),’ or with ama1va1sya1, ‘the new moon (night),’ as in Pha1lguni1 paurn2ama1si1, ‘the full-moon night in the Naks2atra Phalguni1’; 104) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 3. 11 et seq.; vi. 2, 2, 18; xiii. 4, 1, 4; Kausi1taki Bra1hman2a, i. 3; iv. 4; v. 1. See also Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 36, 37, and Ma1sa. or, as is usual in the Su1tras, the Naks2atra adjective alone is used to denote the full-moon night. The month itself is called by a name derived 105) Primarily an adjective, with ma1sa to be supplied--e.g., Pha1lguna, ‘(the month) connected with the Naks2atra Phalguni1.’ from that of a Naks2atra, but only Pha1lguna, 106) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 9, 8.

Ma1gha 110) Ibid.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 8, 1, 4. For the later list, see Weber, Naxatra, 2, 327, 328. occur in the Bra1hman2as, the complete list later being Pha1lguna, Caitra, Vais4a1kha, Jyais2t2ha, A1s2a1d2ha, S4ra1van2a, Praus2t2hapada, A1s4vayuja, Ka1rttika, Ma1rgas4i1rs2a, Tais2ya, Ma1gha. Strictly speaking, these should be lunar months, but the use of a lunar year was clearly very restricted: we have seen that as early as the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a there was a tendency to equate lunar months with the twelve months of thirty days which made up the solar year (see Ma1sa). The Naks2atras and Chronology.--(1) An endeavour has been made to ascertain from the names of the months the period at which the systematic employment of those names was introduced. Sir William Jones 111) Asiatic Researches, 2, 296. refers to this possibility, and Bentley, by the gratuitous assumption that S4ra1van2a always marked the summer solstice, concluded that the names of the months did not date before B.C. 1181. Weber 112) Op. cit., 2, 347, 348; Indische Studien, 9, 455; 10, 230, 231. considered that there was a possibility of fixing a date by this means, but Whitney 113) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 6, 413; 8, 85 et seq. has convincingly shown that it is an impossible feat, and Thibaut 114) Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 16. concurs in this view. Twelve became fixed as the number of the months because of the desire, evident in the Bra1hman2as, somehow or other to harmonize lunar with solar time; but the selection of twelve Naks2atras out of twenty-seven as connected with the night of full moon can have no chronological significance, because full moon at no period occurred in those twelve only, but has at all periods occurred in every one of the twenty-seven at regularly recurrent intervals. (2) All the lists of the Naks2atras begin with Kr2tti1ka1s. It is only fair to suppose that there was some special reason for this fact. Now the later list of the Naks2atras begins with As4vini1, and it was unquestionably rearranged because at the time of its adoption the vernal equinox coincided with the star  Piscium on the border of Revati1 and As4vini1, 115) Cf. Colebrooke, Essays, 2, 264; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 234. say in the course of the sixth century A.D. Weber 116) Naxatra, 2, 362-364; Indische Studien, 10, 234; Indian Literature, 2, n. 2, etc. has therefore accepted the view that the Kr2ttika1s were chosen for a similar reason, and the date at which that Naks2atra coincided with the vernal equinox has been estimated at some period in the third millennium B.C. 117) See Weber. loc. cit.; Bu7hler, Indian Antiquary, 23, 245, n. 20; Tilak, Orion, 40 et seq. A very grave objection to this view is its assumption that the sun, and not the moon, was then regarded as connected with the Naks2atras; and both Thibaut 118) Indian Antiquary, 24, 96. and Oldenberg 119) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 631; 49, 473; 50, 451, 452; Nachrichten der ko7nigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Go7ttingen, 1909, 564; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1103. have pronounced decidedly against the idea of connecting the equinox with the Kr2ttika1s. Jacobi 120) Festgruss an Roth, 68 et seq. = Indian Antiquary, 23, 154 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 218 et seq.; 50, 83; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 463. has contended that in the Rigveda 121) vii. 103 (the ‘frog’ hymn); x. 85 (the ‘marriage’ hymn). the commencement of the rains and the summer solstice mark the beginning of the new year and the end of the old, and that further the new year began with the summer solstice in Phalguni1. 121) vii. 103 (the ‘frog’ hymn); x. 85 (the ‘marriage’ hymn). He has also referred to the distinction of the two sets of Deva and Yama Naks2atras in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 122) i. 5, 2, 8. as supporting his view of the connexion of the sun and the Naks2atras. But this view is far from satisfactory: the Rigveda passages cannot yield the sense required except by translating the word dva1das4a 123) Rv. vii. 103, 9. as ‘the twelfth (month)’ instead of ‘consisting of twelve parts,’ that is, ‘year,’ the accepted interpretation; and the division of the Naks2atras is not at all satisfactorily explained by a supposed connexion with the sun. It may further be mentioned that even if the Naks2atra of Kr2ttika1s be deemed to have been chosen because of its coincidence with the vernal equinox, both Whitney 124) Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 383. and Thibaut 125) Indian Antiquary, 24, 97. Cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 464, n. 4. are prepared to regard it as no more than a careless variant of the date given by the Jyotis2a, which puts the winter solstice in Ma1gha. (3) The winter solstice in Ma1gha is assured by a Bra1hman2a text, for the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 126) xix. 3. This was first noticed by Weber, Naxatra, 2, 345 et seq., who pointed out its relation to the datum of the Jyotis2a. The same date as that of the Jyotis2a is found in a passage of the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra cited by Shamasastry, Gava1m Ayana, 137 (ma1ghe ma1se dhanis2t2ha1bhir uttaren2aiti bha1numa1n, ardha1s4les2asya s4ra1van2asya daks2in2enopanivartate, ‘in the month of Ma1gha the sun goes north with the asterism Dhanis2t2ha1s, in the month of S4ra1van2a he returns south in the middle of the asterism A1s4les2a’; the sense is clear, though the text is corrupt). The passage is apparently not in Caland's manuscripts, or he would have mentioned it in his paper, U7ber das vituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 36, 37. Its date and value are therefore not quite certain. expressly places it in the new moon of Ma1gha (ma1ghasya1ma1va1sya1ya1m). It is not very important whether we take this with the commentators 127) Vina1yaka on Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, loc. cit.; A1narti1ya on S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiii. 19, 1; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 345. The assumption of the scholiasts seems to be due to the fact that to their minds a month must end with a new moon (ama1nta) or with full moon (pu1rn2ima1nta). But there is no reason to say that in Vedic times the month may not have commenced with the new moon; the Kaus2i1taki passage would thus be quite satisfactorily explained. as the new moon in the middle of a month commencing with the day after full moon in Tais2a, or, which is much more likely, as the new moon beginning the month and preceding full moon in Ma1gha. The datum gives a certain possibility of fixing an epoch in the following way. If the end of Revati1 marked the vernal equinox at one period, then the precession of the equinoxes would enable us to calculate at what point of time the vernal equinox was in a position corresponding to the winter solstice in Ma1gha, when the solstitial colure cut the ecliptic at the beginning of S4ravis2t2ha1s. This would be, on the strict theory, in the third quarter of Bharan2i1, 6(3/4) asterisms removed from S4ravis2t2ha1s, and the difference between that and the beginning of As4vini1= 1(3/4) asterisms = 23(1/3)º (27 asterisms being = 360º). Taking the starting-point at 499 A.D., the assured period of Vara1ha Mihira, Jones 128) Asiatic Researches, 2, 393. arrived at the date B. C. 1181 for the vernal equinox corresponding to the winter solstice in Ma1gha--that is, on the basis of 1º = 72 years as the precession. Pratt 129) Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 31, 49. arrived at precisely the same date, taking the same rate of precession and adopting as his basis the ascertained position in the Siddha1ntas of the junction star 130) Cf. Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 373. of Magha1,  Leonis or Regulus. Davis 131) Asiatic Researches, 2, 268; 5, 288. and Colebrooke 132) Essays, 1, 109, 110. See Sir T. Colebrooke, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1, 335 et seq.; Whitney, op. cit., 2, 381, 382. arrived at a different date, B.C. 1391, by taking as the basis of their calculation the junction star of Citra1, which happens to be of uncertain position, varying as much as 3º in the different textbooks. But though the twelfth century has received a certain currency as the epoch of the observation in the Jyotis2a, 133) E.g., Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 606, 607, 976, and cf. Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologic und Mathematik, 17, 18; Tilak, Orion, 38, 39. it is of very doubtful value. As Whitney points out, it is impossible to say that the earlier asterisms coincided in position with the later asterisms of 13(1/3)º extent each. They were not chosen as equal divisions, but as groups of stars which stood in conjunction with the moon; and the result of subsequently making them strictly equal divisions was to throw the principal stars of the later groups altogether out of their asterisms. 134) Whitney, op. cit., 2, 375. Nor can we say that the star  Piscium early formed the eastern boundary of Revati1; it may possibly not even have been in that asterism at all, for it is far remote from the Chinese and Arabic asterisms corresponding to Revati1. Added to all this, and to the uncertainty of the starting-point-582 A.D., 560 A.D., or 491 A.D. being variants 135) Cf. Whitney, op. cit., 377, 379; Weber, op. cit., 2, 363, 364, where he prefers A.D. 582. --is the fact that the place of the equinox is not a matter accurately determinable by mere observation, and that the Hindu astronomers of the Vedic period cannot be deemed to have been very accurate observers, since they made no precise determination of the number of days of the year, which even in the Jyotis2a they do not determine more precisely than as 366 days, and even the Su1rya Siddha1nta 136) See Whitney's note on Su1rya Siddha1nta, iii. 12; op. cit., 2, 369, n. 1; 374, n. 1. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 18. does not know the precession of the equinoxes. It is therefore only fair to allow a thousand years for possible errors, 137) Whitney, 384, followed by Thibaut, Indian Antiquary, 24, 98; Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 18. See also Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 236; Indian Literature, 2, n. 2; Whitney, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1, 313 et seq.; in Colebrooke's Essays, 1^2, 120 et seq.; Max Mu7ller, in his edition of the Rigveda, iv^2, xxx et seq., was also inclined to regard the date as very uncertain; only in his popular works (Chips, 1, 113, etc.) did he accept 1181 B.C., or rather 1186 B.C, as recalculated by Main from Pratt's calculation. Shamasastry's defence, Gava1m Ayana, 122 et seq., of the Jyotis2a shows a misunderstanding the criticisms made. See Keith, ournal of the Royal A siatic Society, 1910, 66, n. 5. and the only probable conclusion to be drawn from the datum of the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a is that it was recording an observation which must have been made some centuries B.C., in itself a result quite in harmony with the probable date of the Bra1hman2a literature, 138) Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 12, 202; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaha, 20 et seq. It has been put earlier: see Thibaut, Astronomie, etc., 18; Bu1hler, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 544, and cf. Bu1hler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xl et seq.; Indian Antiquary, 23, 247; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 45 et seq. See also Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 3; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 31, who are inclined to accept an early date, fourth or fifth century B.C., for the A1pastamba Su1tras, from which a still earlier date for the Bra1hman2as must be conceded. But Eggeling is more probably correct when he assigns the A1pastamba Su1tras to the third century, B.C. See Sacred Books of the East, 12, xl, and it seems unwise unduly to press back the date of Vedic literature. It is noteworthy that in the Epic the solstice is still in Ma1gha (Maha1bha1rata, xiii. 168, 6. 28). Reference is, however, made (ibid., i. 71, 34) to the Naks2atras commencing with S4ravan2a, and the first month is Ma1rgas4i1rs2a (see Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 21 et seq.). Cf. also Tilak, Orion, 37, 216. say B.C. 800-600. (4) Another chronological argument has been derived from the fact that there is a considerable amount of evidence for Pha1lguna having been regarded as the beginning of the year, since the full moon in Phalguni1 is often described as the ‘mouth (mukham) of the year.’ 139) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 8, 1. 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 9, 9. Cf. Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iv. 4; v. 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 2, 18; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, v. 3. 16. According to the Taittiri1ya and the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2as, the beginning falls at the middle of the joint asterism2. Jacobi 140) Indian Antiquary, 23, 156 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 223 et seq.; 50, 72-81. See Tilak, Orion, 53 et seq.; 198 et seq. considers that this was due to the fact that the year was reckoned from the winter solstice, which would coincide with the month of Pha1lguna about B.C. 4000. Oldenberg 141) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 630 et seq.; 49. 475, 476; 50, 453-457. Cf. Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxvii. and Thibaut, 142) Indian Antiquary, 24, 86 et seq. on the other hand, maintain that the choice of Pha1lguna as the ‘mouth’ of the year was due to its being the first month of spring. This view is favoured by the fact that there is distinct evidence 143) See Weber, Naxatra, 2, 329 et seq., and cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 36; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 1; a S4ruti passage in the commentary on Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 2, 13; Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, ii. 2, 4, 23. and especially S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4. 1, 2. 4. So the Pha1lguna full moon is called the ‘month of the seasons’ (r2tu1na1m mukham) in Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 9. of the correspondence of Pha1lguna and the beginning of spring: as we have seen above in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, the new moon in Ma1gha is placed at the winter solstice, 144) xix. 2. 3. which puts the full moon of Phalguni1 at a month and a half after the winter solstice, or in the first week of February, a date not in itself improbable for about B.C. 800, and corresponding with the February 7 of the veris initium in the Roman Calendar. This fact accords with the only natural division of the year into three periods of four months, as the rainy season lasts from June 7-10 to October 7-10, and it is certain that the second set of four months dates from the beginning of the rains (see Ca1turma1sya). Tilak, 145) Orion, 53 et seq.; 198 et seq. on the other hand, holds that the winter solstice coincided with Ma1ghi1 full moon at the time of the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (B.C. 2350), and had coincided with Pha1lguni1 and Caitri1 in early periods--viz., B.C. 4000-2500, and B.C. 60004000. (5) The passages of the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 146) vii. 4, 8, 1. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 147) v. 9. See Weber, op. cit., 2, 341344; Thibaut, Indian Antiquary, 24, 85 et seq., for a full discussion of the points raised by Tilak, Orion, 43 et seq. which treat the full moon in Pha1lguna as the beginning of the year, give as an alternative the full moon in Caitra. Probably the latter month was chosen so as to secure that the initial day should fall well within the season of spring, 148) Thibaut, Indian Antiquary, 24, 93. On the other side, Tilak, 198 et seq. and was not, as Jacobi believes, a relic of a period when the winter solstice corresponded with Caitra. Another alternative is the Eka1s2t2aka1, interpreted by the commentators as the eighth day after the full moon in Magha1s, a time which might, as being the last quarter of the waning half of the old year, well be considered as representing the end of the year. A fourth alternative is the fourth day before full moon; the full moon meant must be that of Caitra, as A1lekhana quoted by A1pastamba held, not of Ma1gha, as A1s4marathya, Lauga1ks2i and the Mi1ma1m2sists believed, and as Tilak believes. 149) Thibaut, op. cit., 94; Tilak, 51 et seq. Cf. also Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiii. 1. 8-10; Weber, 2, 343, n. 2, 344. (6) Others, again, according to the Gr2hya ritual, began the year with the month Ma1rgas4i1rs2a, as is shown by its other name A1graha1yan2a 150) Thibaut, op. cit., 94, 95. Cf. Weber, 2, 332-334. (‘belonging to the commencement of the year’). Jacobi and Tilak 151) Tilak's view is given in Orion, 62 et seq. It is based mainly on Amara's (i. 2, 23) a1gra-ha1yan2a1 as a synonym of Mr2gas4iras, and on certain myths (chaps. v.-vii.); he equates (221 et seq.) A1grayan2a and Orion (!). think that this one denoted the autumn equinox in Mr2gas4iras, corresponding to the winter solstice in Phalguni1. But, as Thibaut 152) Op. cit., 94, 95. shows clearly, it was selected as the beginning of a year that was taken to commence with autumn, just as some took the spring to commence with Caitra instead of Pha1lguna. 153) A corresponding Ka1rttika year is not early, Thibaut, op. cit., 96. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 2, 334. (7) Jacobi has also argued, with the support of Bu7hler, 154) Indian Antiquary, 23, 242 et seq. from the terms given for the beginning of Vedic study in the Gr2hya Su1tras, on the principle that study commenced with the rains (as in the Buddhist vassa1) which mark the summer solstice. He concludes that if Bha1drapada appears as the date of commencing study in some texts, it was fixed thus because at one time Pros2t2hapada1s (the early name of Bhadrapada1s) coincided with the summer solstice, this having been the case when the winter solstice was in Pha1lguna. But Whitney 155) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxiv et seq. has pointed out that this argument is utterly illegitimate; we cannot say that there was any necessary connexion between the rains and learning--a month like S4ra1van2a might be preferred because of its connexion with the word S4ravan2a, ‘ear’--and in view of the precession of the equinoxes, we must assume that Bha1drapada was kept because of its traditional coincidence with the beginning of the rains after it had ceased actually so to coincide. 156) Mention should here be made of the following points: (1) Jacobi's argument from the word Dhruva, the name of the star pointed out to the bride in the marriage ritual. The word does not occur in the literature anterior to the Gr2hya Su1tras, and it must remain an undecided question whether the practice was or was not old. Jacobi urges that Dhruva means ‘fixed,’ and that it must originally have referred to a real fixed pole star, and he thinks that such a star could only be found in the third millennium B.C. Whitney and Oldenberg definitely reject this view on the ground that too much must not be made out of a piece of folk-lore, and that the marriage ritual requirements would be satisfied by any star of some magnitude which was approximately polar. This conclusion seems convincing. Cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1102; 1910, 465; contra, Jacobi, ibid., 1909, 726 et seq.; 1910, 464. (2) The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 2, 3, asserts that the Kr2ttika1s do not move from the eastern quarter, which the others do; and stress has been laid (by Jacobi, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 463, 464) upon this assertion as giving a date of the third millennium B.C. for the S4atapatha observation. But this notice is quite inadequate to support any such result, and its lack of trustworthiness as a chronological guide is increased by the fact that the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xviii 5, has a similar notice, coupled with another notice, which, according to Barth, would only be true somewhere in or after the sixth century A.D., the equatorial point being placed between Citra1 and Sva1ti1, which in the early period were both very much north of the equator (see Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 37-39). The same passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 2, 2, in the Ma1dhyam2dina recension, states that the number of the Kr2ttika1s is greater than that of the stars in any of the other Naks2atras, which consist of one, two, three, or four stars, or which, according to the Ka1n2va recension (see Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 282, n. 2), have four stars. It is not possible to put much faith in this assertion, for Hasta later has five stars, and its name (with reference to the fingers) suggests five (cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 368, 381), and that number is possibly referred to in the Rigveda (i. 105, 10). See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 177. (3) Attempts have been made to regard the names of the Naks2atras as significant of their position in the list. Thus Bentley, Historical View, 2, thought Vis4a1kha1 was so called because the equinoctial colure divided the equator about 1426 B.C.; this is refuted by Tilak, Orion, 57 et seq. Jyes2t2haghni1 has been interpreted as ‘slaying the eldest’--i.e., as marking the new year by putting an end to the old year. Tilak, 90, suggests that Mu1la was so called because its acronycal rising marked the beginning of the year when the vernal equinox was near Mr2gas4iras. More probable is Whitney's view, Sa1rya Siddha1nta, 194, that it was the most southern, and so, as it were, the basis of the asterisms. The Origin of the Naks2atras.--As we have seen, there is no evidence showing the process by which the Naks2atras may have originated in India. They are mentioned only as stars in the earlier parts of the Rigveda, then the names of three of them are found in the latest parts of that Sam2hita1, and finally in the later Atharvaveda and in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s the full list appears. It may also be noted that the Vedic Indians show (see Graha) a remarkably small knowledge of the other astronomical phenomena; the discovery of a series of 27 lunar mansions by them would therefore be rather surprising. On the other hand, the nature of such an operation is not very complicated; it consists merely in selecting a star or a star group with which the moon is in conjunction. It is thus impossible a priori to deny that the Vedic Indians could have invented for themselves a lunar Zodiac. 157) Max Mu7ller, Rigveda, 4^2, xliv et seq., maintains the Indian origin of the system. Thrbaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 14, 15, admits it to be possible, as does Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 418. But the question is complicated by the fact that there exist two similar sets of 28 stars or star groups in Arabia and in China, the Mana1zil and the Sieou. The use of the Mana1zil in Arabia is consistent and effective; the calendar is regulated by them, and the position of the asterisms corresponds best with the positions required for a lunar Zodiac. The Indians might therefore have borrowed the system from Arabia, but that is a mere possibility, because the evidence for the existence of the Mana1zil is long posterior to that for the existence of the Naks2atras, while again the Mazzaroth or Mazzaloth of the Old Testament 158) 2 Kings xxiii. 5; Job xxxviii. 32. may really be the lunar mansions. 159) Weber, Naxatra, 1, 317, 318; Whitney, op, cit., 359. That the Arabian system is borrowed from India, as Burgess 160) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 309-334. This was Weber's view also, according to Whitney, 413 et seq.; but Weber himself disclaimed it (see Indische Studien, 9, 425, 426; 10, 246, 247). On the other hand, Se4dillot, Mate4riaux pour servir a11 l'histoire compare4e des 'Sciences Mathe4matiques par les Grecs et les Orientaux (Paris, 1845-1849), favoured influence from Arabia on India. held, is, on the other hand, not at all probable. Biot, the eminent Chinese scholar, in a series of papers published by him between 1839 and 1861, 161) Summed up in his two works, Recherches sur l'ancienne astronomie Chinoise, and E4tudes sur l'astronomie Indieune et l'astronomie Chinoise. attempted to prove the derivation of the Naks2atra from the Chinese Sieou. The latter he did not regard as being in origin lunar mansions at all. He thought that they were equatorial stars used, as in modern astronomy, as a standard to which planets or other stars observed in the neighbourhood can be eferred; they were, as regards twenty-four of them, selecte about B.C. 2357 on account of their proximity to the equator, and of their having the same right ascension as certain circumpolar stars which had attracted the attention of Chinese observers. Four more were added in B.C. 1100 in order to mark the equinoxes and solstices of the period. He held that the list of stars commenced with Mao (= Kr2ttika1s), which was at the vernal equinox in B.C. 2357. Weber, 162) Naxatra, 1, 284 et seq. (1860). in an elaborate essay of 1860, disputed this theory, and endeavoured to show that the Chinese literary evidence for the Sieou was late, dating not even from before the third century B.C. The last point does not appear 163) See Chavannes, cited by Oldenberg, Nachrichten der ko7nigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Go1ttingen, 1909, 566, 567. to be correct, but his objections against the basis of Biot's theory were reinforced by Whitney, 164) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 1 et seq.; Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 385 et seq. For his controversy with Weber, see Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 424 et seq.; 10, 213 et seq.; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 384 et seq. who insisted that Biot's supposition of the Sieou's not having been ultimately derived from a system of lunar mansions, was untenable. This is admitted by the latest defender of the hypothesis of borrowing from China, Le4opold de Saussure, 165) T'oung Pao, 1909, 121 et seq.; 255 et seq. , but his arguments in favour of a Chinese origin for the Indian lunar mansions have been refuted by Oldenberg, 166) Nachrichten, 1909, 544-572. who has also pointed out 167) Ibid., 548, n. 9. that the series does not begin with Mao (= Kr2ttika1s). There remains only the possibility that a common source for all the three sets--Naks2atra, Mana1zil, and Sieou--may be found in Babylonia. Hommel 168) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 45, 592 et seq. has endeavoured to show that recent research has established in Babylonia the existence of a lunar zodiac of twenty-four members headed by the Pleiades (= Kr2ttika1s); but Thibaut's researches 169) Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 63. 144-163. Cf. Astronomie, etc., 15; Oldenberg, op. cit., 572. are not favourable to this claim. On the other hand, Weber, 170) Naxatra, 1, 316 et seq.; Indische Studien, 10, 246, and elsewhere. Weber, Naks2atra, 2, 362, 400, laid great stress on the fact that the Jyotis2a, 8, referred to the difference of the longest and shortest day as being six muhu1rtas, which makes the longest day fourteen hours twenty-four minutes: and he compared the Babylonian day of fourteen hours twenty-five minutes, and a Chinese day of fourteen hours twentyfour minutes. But Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 417, 418, shows that no stress can be laid on this argument, since the correspondence is only approximate, and the latitudes of the Babylonian and Chinese observations are approximately the same. Whitney, 171) See op. cit., 2, 418-420. Zimmer, 172) Altindisches Leben, 356, 357, where he is quite confident of the Semitic origin of the Naks2atras. and Oldenberg 173) Op. cit., 572. all incline to the view that in Babylonia is to be found the origin of the system, and this must for the present be regarded as the most probable view, for there are other traces of Babylonian influence in Vedic literature, such as the legend of the flood, perhaps the A1dityas, 174) For the flood, see Zimmer, op. cit., 101, 357, who is opposed to Weber's view (Indische Studien, 1, 160; Indische Streifen, 1, 11) that the story preserves an old A1ryan tradition, and a reminiscence of the home of the Indians beyond the Hima1laya (cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 190; 2^2, 323, n. 96; Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 638, and cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 276, n. 3). For the A1dityas, see Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 185 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 50, 43 et seq. His view is not accepted by Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 44; Bloomfield, Religion of the Veda, 133. Still more doubtful is Zimmer's view (Altindisches Leben, 363, 364) of the division of day and night into thirty parts, which he sees in Rv. i. 123, 8, and which he thinks is based on the Babylonian division of the same period of time into sixtieths. Cf. also V. Smith, Indian Antiquary, 34, 230, who argues, but inconclusively, that the use of iron was introduced from Babylonia. The facts about the Naks2atras are (with the exception of the data from the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 and the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra) collected in Weber's second essay, Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra, 1861. The first essay, 1860, deals with the problem of origins. See also his discussions in Indische Studien, 9, 424 et seq.; 10, 213 et seq. Whitney's work lies partly in his scientific determination (in many places correcting Colebrooke's discoveries) of the later Naxatras in his edition and version of the Su1rya Siddha1nta (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 6), and partly in his discussions of the question of origin (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8), Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 341-421 (with a stellar chart), and of the question of date as against Jacobi and Tilak's Orion (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxii et seq.). The views of Max Mu7ller are found in his Rigveda, 4^2, xxxiv et seq. The modern discussion of the dates inferable from the Naks2atra was inaugurated by Jacobi (1893) in the Festgruss an Roth, 68-74 (translated in the Indian Antiquary, 23). See also his articles in the Nachrichten der ko1nigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Go1ttingen, 1894, 110 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 218 et seq.; 50, 70 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 721727. Independently Tilak, in his Orion, developed similar views; but most of his special points are disposed of by Whitney in his review cited above. Oldenberg has discussed and refuted Jacobi's arguments in the Zeitschrift, 48, 629 et seq.; 49, 470 et seq.; 50, 450 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1090 et seq. Thibaut has also rejected Jacobi's views in an article in the Indian Antiquary, 24, 85 et seq. See also his Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 17-19. The recent literature on the origin of the Naks2atras consists of articles by Thibaut, Journa of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 63, 144 et seq.; Saussure, Toung Pao, 1909, 121 et seq.; 255 et seq.; Oldenberg, Nachrichten der ko7nigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Go7ttingen, 1909, 544 et seq. The Naks2atras in the Epic are dealt with by Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 29-36. Ludwig's views are given in his Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 183 et seq. and possibly the word Mana1. 

नक्षत्रदर्श
नक्षत्र-दर्श
 (‘gazer at the lunar mansions’), an ‘astrologer,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 10; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 4, 1. A notice in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) ii. 1, 2, 19, and cf. the Ka1n2va text in Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, xii, 288, n. 3. indicates that that work regarded the practice of choosing a particular Naks2atra under which to set up the sacrificial fires as an idle one, because it decides in favour of choosing the sun as one's Naks2atra.

नक्षत्रविद्या
नक्षत्र-विद्या,
 the ‘science of the lunar mansions,’ ‘astronomy,’ is mentioned with other sciences in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1).

नख
नख
 denotes either the ‘nail’ of a man, 1) Rv. i. 162, 9; x. 163, 5; Av. ii. 33, 6, etc. or the ‘claw’ of a wild beast, such as a tiger. 2) Rv. iv. 3, 3. Cf. x. 28, 10, of the eagle's talon. The trimming (nikr2ntana) 3) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 6. of the nails was a regular part of the toilet of the Vedic Indian, especially on occasions of special sanctity, when it accompanied the cleansing of the teeth. 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 1, 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 6, 2, etc.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 3, 4. 

नग
न-ग
 (‘not moving’), ‘mountain,’ is a word occurring only in a late book of the Atharvaveda (xix. 8, 1), and then in the Su1tras.

नगर
नगर
 is in early Vedic literature found only in the derivative adjective, used as a proper name, Nagarin, but it appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka (i. 11, 18; 31, 4), and frequently in the later language.

नगरिन्जानश्रुतेय
नगरिन् जान-श्रुतेय
 (‘descendant of Janas4ruti’) is mentioned as a priest in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (v. 30), and as Nagarin Ja1nas4ruteya Ka1n2d2viya in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 40, 2).

नग्नजित्
नग्न-जित्,
 King of Gandha1ra, is mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 34. as having been consecrated by Parvata and Na1rada. The same king is mentioned with his son Svarjit in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) viii. 1, 4, 10. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 132, 134; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 515. where a remark attributed to one of them on a ritual topic is treated with contempt.

नचिकेतस्
न-चिकेतस्
 occurs in the well-known legend of the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 11, 8. (where he is a Gotama, the son of Va1jas4ravasa), and in the Kat2ha Upanis2ad. 2) i. 1, etc. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 154, n, 1; Weber, Indian Literature, 157; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 168. His historical reality is extremely doubtful: in the Upanis2ad he is called son of A1run2i Audda1laki or Va1jas4ravasa, an impossible attribution, and one due only to a desire to give Naciketas a connexion with the famous A1run2i. 

नड
1. Nad2a, ‘reed,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 1, 33. as growing in lakes, and in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 19, 1. is described as va1rs2ika, ‘produced in the rains.’ Reeds were used, after being split, for making mats, a work carried out by women. 3) Av. vi. 138, 5. They are frequently mentioned elsewhere. 4) Av. vi. 137, 2; xii. 2, 1, 19. 50. 54; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 19; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, vi. 7, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71. See also Nada.

नडनैषध
2. Nad2a Nais2adha is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) ii. 2, 2, 1. 2. where he seems to be 2) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 225-227, followed by Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 338, notes 4 and 5. The printed text has Nais2idha by error. a human king who is compared with Yama, the god of death, because of his conquests. Being there identified with the southern sacrificial fire, he was presumably a king of the south, just as Yama is connected with the south.

नड्वला
नड्वला,
 a ‘reed bed,’ is mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (xxx. 16) and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (iii. 4, 12, 1).

नद
नद
 is found in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 32, 8; 179, 4; ii. 34, 3; viii. 69, 2; x. 11, 2; 105, 4. Cf. Nirukta, v. 2. but its sense is still obscure. It is identified by Pischel 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 35, 717 et seq.; Vedische Studien, 1, 183 et seq. with Nad2a, being explained by him in one passage 3) i. 32, 8. Here Caland and Henry, L'Agnis2t2oma, 312, n., would read nal2am. See also Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, 173. as a reed boat, which is split, and over which the waters go; in another 4) ii. 34, 3, followed by Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 301 (who, however, does not construe a1s4ubhih2, ‘sharp,’ with karn2aih2 as Pischel does in Vedische Studien, 1, 190). He sees ‘reed’ also in x. 11, 2, but ‘horse’ in x. 105, 4. as a reed whip, of which the sharp points (karn2a) are used to urge horses on; and in others 5) i. 179, 4; viii. 69, 2. again as figuratively designating the penis. Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The sense of ‘bull’ seems imperative in viii. 89, 2; it is admissible in i. 179, 4, where ‘bull’ may denote a man, and in x. 11, 2, and possibly in i. 32, 8, but ‘reed’ there seems far more likely. takes the sense to be ‘bull’ (either literally or meta phorically) in all passages. Once at least 7) x. 105, 4. and in x. 11, 2. The latter passage suggests that ‘river’ may, after all, be the sense there. Cf. Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 32, 178, 215. the ‘neigher’ (from the root nad, ‘sound’) seems to be meant with reference to Indra's horse. In the phrase nadasya karn2aih2^8 the sense is, perhaps, ‘through the ears of the (side) horse’ (that is, by their being ready to hear the word of command) of their chariot, the Maruts ‘hasten on with their swift steeds’ (turayanta a1s4ubhih2).

नदी
नदी,
 ‘stream,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 158, 5; ii. 35, 3; iii. 33, 4; v. 46, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. iii. 13, 1; xiv. 1, 43. Reference is made to shallows (ga1dha) 3) Rv. vii. 60, 7. in the river's bed, to the opposite bank (pa1ra), 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 1, 6, 6. and to the bathing of horses in streams. 5) Rv. viii. 2, 2. Rivers are also mentioned in close connexion with mountains. 6) Rv. v. 55, 7; x. 64, 8. The title Nadi1-pati, ‘lord of rivers,’ 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 4, 10. is once used to express ‘ocean’ or ‘sea-water.’

नना
नना
 is a familiar name for mother, parallel with Tata, for father, with which it is found in a verse of the Rigveda 1) ix. 112, 3. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 6, and see Upala-praks2in2i1. describing the occupations of the parents of the poet.

ननान्दृ
ननान्दृ
 is a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 46. where it denotes, according to Sa1yan2a, the ‘husband's sister,’ over whom the wife is to rule. This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that the same position is ascribed to the husband's sister--no doubt while unmarried and living in her brother's care--by the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 2) iii. 22. Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 516. The native lexicographers recognize the word, though its occurrence in the later literature is very rare (it has been noted in the Uttarara1macarita). See the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

नपात्
नपात्
 in Vedic literature apparently has both the wider sense of ‘descendant,’ 1) It is equivalent to ‘son’ in a number of mythological epithets such as apa1m2 napa1t, ‘son of waters.’ and the narrower one of ‘grandson’ in the Sam2hita1s. 2) Rv. x. 10, 1, clearly ‘son’; vi. 20, 11, may be ‘grandson.’ Most passages, vi. 50, 15; vii. 18, 22; viii. 65, 12; 102, 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 61; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxii. 2, require ‘descendant.’ In the Bra1hman2as the word seems hardly to have the sense of ‘descendant’ at all, while it denotes not only ‘grandson,’ 3) As in Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 48; putra-napta1rah2. ‘sons and grandsons.’ Cf. Nirukta, viii. 5. but also ‘great-grandson’ in the sequence ‘sons, grandsons, great-grandsons’ (putra1n, pautra1n, naptr21n). 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 10, 3; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, x. 11, 5. ‘Grandson’ is also expressed by Pautra (‘son's son’) in the Atharvaveda and later, 5) Av. ix. 5, 30; xi. 7, 16; Aitarey Bra1hman2a, vii. 10, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 8, 3. while the sense of ‘great-grandson’ is accurately conveyed as early as the Rigveda 6) Rv. viii. 17, 13, with napa1t. by Pra-n2apa1t, used beside Napa1t, ‘grandson.’ Napti1, the feminine, is practically limited to the Sam2hita1s, 7) Rv. iii. 31, 1 (Nirukta, iii. 4); viii. 2, 42. Cf. i. 50, 9; ix. 9, 1; 14, 5; 69, 3; Av. i. 28, 4; ii. 14, 1; vii. 82, 6. and denotes ‘daughter.’ The use in the Veda throws no light on the original use of the word. 8) Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 403-405; Lanmann, Festgruss an Bo7htlingk, 77.

 is the name of a R2s2i who is referred to in the Rigveda 1) viii. 40, 4. 5. and the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 2) vi. 24. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. The Anukraman2i1 (Index) attributes to Na1bha1ka the composition of several hymns of the Rigveda (viii. 39-42).

नभ्य,
 the ‘nave’ of the wheel, is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 70, 3; xii. 1, 12. and later. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 15; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 3, 20; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, ix. 4; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 3, 23, etc. See also Na1bhi.

Sa1pya may be read Sa1yya, but Sa1yan2a recognizes the p; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutscheu Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. he is represented as engaged in the contest against Namuci.

नर
नर, नृ
 --The general name for ‘man’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 25, 5; 167, 20; 178, 3; ii. 34, 6; iii. 16, 4, etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 9, 2; ix. 1, 3; xiv. 2, 9; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 34; vi. 27. 32, etc. is Nr2, while Nara 3) This form of the word, common in the post-Vedic language, is secondary, having originated from cases like naram, understood as nara-m; but its origin goes back to the Indo-Iranian period. See Brugmann, Grundriss, 2, 106. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 318, a 5. is found occasionally in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 12, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 3, 1, 3; Nirukta, v. 1, etc.

नराची
नराची
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 31, 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 286. perhaps meaning a poisonous plant.

नर्य
नर्य
 (‘manly’) is in two passages of the Rigveda (i. 54, 6; 112, 9) understood by the commentator Sa1yan2a as the proper name of a man. See also Na1rya. 

नलद
नलद,
 ‘nard’ (Nardastachys Jatamansi) is a plant mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 102, 3. in the Aitareya 2) iii. 2, 4. and the S4a1n3kha1yana 3) xi. 4. A1ran2yakas (where it is mentioned as used for a garland), as well as in the Su1tras. In the Atharvaveda 4) iv. 37, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68, 69; Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 420; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 177, n. 4. the feminine form of the word, Naladi1, occurs as the name of an Apsaras, or celestial nymph.

नवक
नवक
 is mentioned as having wished for a wife at the Sattra of the Vibhinduki1yas in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a. 1) ii. 233 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 38).

नवग्व
नव-ग्व
 occurs in several passages of the Rigveda 1) iv. 51, 4; ix. 108, 4; x. 62, 6. as a man, an An3giras in the highest degree (An3girastama), 2) x. 62, 6. apparently being the type of the Navagvas, 3) Rv. i. 62, 4; iii. 39, 5; v. 29, 12; 45, 7. 11; vi. 22, 2; x. 14, 6; 61, 10; 108, 8; Av. xiv. 1, 56; xviii. 3, 20, etc. who appear as a mystic race of olden times, coupled with, and conceived probably as related to, the An3girases. They are often associated with the Das4agvas. 4) Rv. i. 62, 4; iv. 51, 4; v. 29, 12; x. 62, 6, etc. Cf. Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 144 (B), 170.

नवनीत
नव-नीत,
 ‘fresh butter,’ is mentioned frequently in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. ii. 3, 10, 1; vi. 1, 1, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 4, etc. and the Bra1hman2as. 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 3, 7. 8; v. 3, 2, 6; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 3. According to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 3) i. 3. this is the kind of butter which is fitted for anointing an embryo (garbha), while the gods receive A1jya, men fragrant ghee (Ghr2ta), and the fathers A1yuta. Elsewhere 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 10, 1, etc it is contrasted with Ghr2ta and Sarpis. 

नववास्त्व
नव-वास्त्व
 appears in three passages of the Rigveda. In one 1) i. 36, 18. he seems to be a prote4ge4 of Agni; in another 2) vi. 20, 11. as perhaps a son of Us4anas and favourite of Indra, but in the last he seems to be defeated, or even slain, by Indra. 3) x. 49, 6. Cf. Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 223; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 581; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 128, 129; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147; Uber die neuesten Arbeiten auf dem Gebiete der R2gvedaforschung, 160; Perry, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, 202; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 158. But he may be a mythic figure altogether. Cf. also Br2hadratha.

नह्
नह्
 has been taken by Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Grassmann 2) Wo7rterbuch, s.v. to be the stem, meaning ‘bond,’ of the dative form nadbhyas, which occurs once in the Rigveda, 3) x. 60, 6. and which Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 129. thinks means ‘sister's sons.’ But the sense of this dative is probably rather ‘to the grandsons.’ 5) Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 56, 3b.

नहुस्
नहुस्
 occurs several times in the Rigveda, but the exact sense is not certain. Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 206. sees in the Nahus a tribe on the Sindhu (Indus) 2) Rv. i. 31, 11; vi. 22, 10; 46, 7; x. 80, 6. or Sarasvati1, 3) Rv. vii. 95, 2. Cf. ix. 88, 2; 91, 2. rich in horses, 4) Rv. viii. 6, 24. allied with the Bharatas and S4imyus, 5) Rv. i. 100, 18; vii. 18, 5. connected with Kaks2i1vant and the Va1rs2a1giras, 6) Rv. i. 100, 16. 17. and having as kings Mas4ars4a1ra and A1yavasa. 7) Rv. i. 122, 15. Cf. also nahus2o vis4ah2, Rv. vii. 6, 5; x. 49, 8; 99, 7, etc. Roth, 8) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. on the other hand, sees in Nahus the general sense of ‘neighbour’ as opposed to a member of one's own people (Vis4); this interpretation is supported by the occurrence of the phrase nahus2o nahus2t2ara, 9) Rv. x. 49, 8. Cf. also viii. 8, 3. ‘closer than a neighbour.’ Nahus2a has the same sense as Nahus in two passages of the Rigveda, 10) i. 31, 11; v. 12, 6. but in one it seems to be intended for the proper name of a man. 11) Rv. viii. 46, 27. Possibly Nahus was originally a man like Manu. 12) Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 28; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 324. But Nahus, if it was originally the name of a mythic forefather, cannot have been that of a forefather recognized by all the tribes, for there is no passage in which it applies to all men. Geldner, R2gveda, Glossar, 92, regards Nahus as a tribe, Nahus2a as a king. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 128, leaves the question open. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 165, n. 7; 179 et seq.; 307 et seq.

नाक
1. Na1ka denotes the ‘firmament’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 60, 10; 125, 5; iii. 2, 12; iv. 13, 5; vii. 86, 1; 99, 2; viii. 103, 2; ix. 73, 4, etc. and later. 2) Av. vii. 18, 1; xviii. 2, 47; xiii. 1, 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 10; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xviii. 7, 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 5, 3, 4, etc. It is often used with the epithet ‘highest’ (uttama) 3) Av. iv. 14, 6; xi. 1, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 10; xii. 63. or ‘third’ (tr2ti1ya) 4) Av. vi. 122, 4; ix. 5, 1. 4; xviii. 4, 3. referring to the threefold division of heaven, parallel to the threefold division of earth, atmosphere, and sky (Div). The Na1ka is said to be on the third ridge (pr2s2t2ha), above the luminous space (rocana) of the sky. 5) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 50. Elsewhere 6) Av. iv. 14, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 67. In Rv. x. 121, 5, the earth and sky (dyauh2), and heaven (svar), and the firmament (na1ka), are all mentioned. the series earth, atmosphere, sky, and the firmament (na1ka), heaven (svar), the celestial light (jyotis), occurs. The word na1ka is explained in the Bra1hman2as 7) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, x. 1, 18; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 4, 1, 24; Nirukta, ii. 14; and cf. Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, ii. 10, 5. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 9; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 50, 56, 57. as derived from na, ‘not,’ and aka, ‘pain,’ because those who go there are free from sorrow.

नाक
2. Na1ka is the name of a teacher in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 1) iii. 13, 5. Presumably he is identical with Na1ka Maudgalya (‘descendant of Mudgala’), who is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) xii. 5, 2, 1. the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 3) vi. 4, 4. and the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad. 4) i. 9, 1. 

नाक्र
नाक्र
 is the name of an aquatic animal included among the victims at the As4vamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 13, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 35. Perhaps the animal meant is the crocodile, which later is called Nakra. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96, following one version given by Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 21, n. 4.

नाग
नाग
 appears once in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xi. 2, 7, 12. in the form maha1na1ga, where ‘great snake’ or ‘great elephant’ may be meant. In the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 2) i. 3, 24. and in a citation found in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 3) viii. 22. the sense of ‘elephant’ is clearly intended. In the Su1tras 4) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 4, 1. Cf. Winternitz, Sarpabali, 43; Mac. donell, Vedic Mythology, p. 153. the mythic Na1ga already occurs.

नाग्नजित
नाग्न-जित,
 ‘descendant of Nagnajit,’ is the patronymic of Svarjit in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (viii. 1, 4, 10).

नाचिकेत
नाचिकेत,
 ‘connected with Naciketas,’ is the title of a narrative (upa1khya1na) in the Ka1t2haka Upanis2ad. 1) iii. 16. The word is also applied as an epithet to a special fire in that Upanis2ad 2) i. 18; ii. 10. and in the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad. 3) i. 22, 11; 26, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 386. The native lexicographers give Na1chiketa and Na1ciketu as synonyms of fire generally.

नाडपित्
नाड-पित्
 occurs in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 5, 4, 13. as the birthplace of Bharata. The word may, however, be read as Na1d2a-piti1, the name of Bharata's mother, 2) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 6, n. 3. Cf. Leumann, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 81. but this is less probable. 

नाडी
1. Na1d2i1 denotes a ‘vein’ or ‘artery’ in the human body in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 138, 4; x. 7, 15. 16. and later, 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 4, 5, 2; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 21; iv. 2, 3, etc.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 6, 1; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 19. a natural extension of the literal sense of ‘reed.’

नाडी
2. Na1d2i1 means a musical instrument, a ‘reed flute,’ in the Rigveda 1) x. 135, 7. as well as the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 2) xxiii. 4; xxxiv. 5. where in one passage it is mentioned along with the Tu1n2ava. 3) xxxiv. 5. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 329.

नाडी
3. Na1d2i1 in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 8, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 12. seems to mean the box of the chariot wheel.

नाडीका
नाडीका
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 18, 8. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 229; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 251; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 432. where the sense seems clearly to be ‘wind-pipe,’ with a reference also to the ‘shaft of an arrow’ made of reed.

नाथ
नाथ
 in Vedic literature 1) Av. iv. 20, 9; ix. 2, 17; xviii. 1, 13; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 4, 1. Also in Av. xiii. 2, 37, na1tha-ka1ma, ‘seeking help’; xi, 1, 15, na1tha-vid, ‘finding help’; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 11, 23, na1tha-vindu, ‘procuring protection,’ as the name of a Sa1man, or chant. appears only as a neuter meaning ‘protection,’ and is of rare occurrence. 2) In the post-Vedic literature, on the other hand, the word is a masculine, meaning ‘protector,’ and is very common. Generally, too, very little appears in Vedic literature of practices such as those which produced Anglo-Saxon society or the Roman patronatus.

नापित
नापित,
 ‘barber,’ is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 1, 2, 2. and later. 2) Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vii. 2, 8. 13; A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 17, etc. But the older word is Vaptr2, 3) Rv. x. 142, 4. a derivative of vap, ‘shave,’ with forms of which verb shaving is referred to as early as the Rigveda. 4) x. 142, 4. Cf. i. 65, 4; Av. vi. 68; v 2, 17, etc. The dead were shaved before burial. 5) Av. v. 19, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 266; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 265.

नाभाक
नाभाक,
 ‘descendant of Nabha1ka,’ is the name of a R2s2i, or seer, in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 41, 2; Nirukta, x. 5. The Anukraman2i1 (Index) ascribes three or four hymns of the Rigveda 2) viii. 39-41, and doubtfully 42. to him. According to Ludwig, 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. the man was an A1n3girasa, 4) viii. 40, 12. not a Kan2va.

नाभानेदिष्ठ
नाभा-नेदिष्ठ
 (‘nearest in descent’) Ma1nava (‘descendant of Manu’) is famous in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1. 9. 4-6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 14. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 191 et seq. for the way in which he was treated when his father Manu divided his property among his sons, or they divided it: Na1bha1nedis2t2ha was left out, but was solaced by obtaining, through his father's advice, cows from the An3girases, a feat which is regarded in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xvi. 11. 28-30. as on a level with the exploits of other seers who celebrated their patrons in hymns, and as giving rise to the hymn, Rigveda x. 62. Na1bha1nedis2t2ha's hymn is repeatedly mentioned in the Bra1hman2as, 3) Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxviii. 4, merely refers to him as connected with the An3girases. See also ibid., xxx. 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 30. 31; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xx. 9, 4. but beyond its authorship nothing is recorded of him. In the Sam2hita1 4) x. 61, 18. itself he seems to be spoken of as a poet in one passage, which is, however, of quite uncertain meaning. Na1bha1nedis2t2ha is etymologically connected in all probability with Naba1nazdis2ta in the Avesta, which refers to the Fravas2i of the paoiryo1-t2kae1sha and the Fravas2i of the Naba1nazdis2ta. Lassen 5) Indische Alterthumskunde, 1, 520, and Addenda, p. lxxvii. saw in the legend a reminiscence of an Indo-Iranian split; but Roth 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 6, 243 et seq. showed conclusively that this was impossible, and that Na1bha1nedis2t2ha meant simply ‘nearest in birth,’ and Weber 7) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 40-50. Cf. also Da1ya. admits that the connexion of the words is not one of borrowing on either side, but that in the Avesta it has kept its original sense of ‘nearest relation,’ while in the Rigveda it has become a proper name.

नाभि
1. Na1bhi develops from the literal sense of ‘navel’ the figurative meaning of ‘relationship,’ 1) i. 105, 9; 164, 33; ii. 3, 9; 40, 4, etc.; Av. xii. 1, 40; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 8; xi. 12; xx. 1, etc. or, concretely, ‘relation.’ 2) Rv. i. 163, 12; vi. 47, 28; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 42-44. 50, etc.

नाभि
2. Na1bhi, ‘nave’ of a chariot wheel, is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) v. 43, 8; vi. 39, 4; viii. 41, 6. and later. 2) Av. iii. 30, 6; x. 8, 34; xi. 7, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 4; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 5, 11; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vii. 15, 1; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 4; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 8. See also Ratha, and cf. Nabhya.

नामधेय
नाम-धेय,
 ‘name,’ is found in the Rigveda, 1) x. 71, 1. and often in the later language. 2) Av. vii. 109, 6; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 9, 3; iii. 3, 4, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 1, 6, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 3, 11; vi. 4, 25; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 4; Aitareya Upanis2ad, v. 2, etc. See Na1man.

नामन्
नामन्,
 ‘name,’ is a common word from the Rigveda onwards. The Gr2hya Su1tras 1) Weber, Naxatra, 2, 316 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 46, 47; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 152. give elaborate rules for the formation of the names of children, but more important is the distinction between the secret (guhya) and the ordinary name, though the rules as to the secret name are not at all consistent. The secret name is already recognized in the Rigveda, 2) Cf. x. 55, 2; 71, 1, as explained in Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 3, 3. and is referred to in the Bra1hman2as, 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 3, 9 (the name is given to a child at birth); Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 25. one secret name, that of Arjuna for Indra, being given in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 4) ii. 1, 2, 11; v. 4, 3, 7; Weber, 2, 317, n. 3. It is to be noted that the rule as to giving the designation of a Naks2atra (lunar asterism) as the secret name or otherwise is not illustrated by a single recorded name of a teacher in the Bra1hman2as. 5) Weber, 2, 318, 319. See As2a1d2ha, Rauhin2a, Rauhin2a1yana. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 6) iii. 6, 2, 24; v. 3, 3, 14; ix. 4, 3, 3, which directs that the name should be derived from a feast performed by the person in question. See also Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvi. 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 17. several times mentions the adoption of a second name with a view to securing success, and also refers to the adoption of another name for purposes of distinction. 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 4, 4. Cf. vi. 1, 3, 9. In actual practice two names are usually found in the Bra1hman2as, the second being a patronymic or a metronymic, as in Kaks2i1vant Aus4ija 8) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 11, 17. (if the story of the slave woman Us4ij as his mother is correct), or Br2haduktha Va1mneya, 9) Ibid., xiv. 9, 38. ‘son of Va1mni1,’ though the relationship may, of course, be not direct parentage, but more remote descent. 10) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 14; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2. Three names are less common--for example, Ku1s4a1mba Sva1yava La1tavya, 11) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, viii. 6, 8. ‘son of Sva1yu, of the La1tavya (son of Latu) family,’ or Devataras S4ya1vasa1yana Ka1s4yapa, 12) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 40, 2. where the patronymic and the Gotra name are both found. In other cases the names probably have a local reference--e.g., Kaus4a1mbeya and Ga1n3gya. Frequently the patronymic only is given, as Bha1rgava, Maudgalya, etc., or two patronymics are used. The simple name is often used for the patronymic--e.g., Trasadasyu. 13) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 2, 13; Hopkins, Religions of India, 201, n. 2. In a few cases the name of the wife is formed from the husband's name, 14) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 135. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 2, 316-320; Hopkins, loc. cit. as Us4i1nara1n2i1, Purukutsa1ni1, Mudgala1ni1.

नाम्ब
नाम्ब
 is the name of a kind of grain mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) v. 3, 3, 8. A1mba is the form of the word in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 2) i. 8, 10, 1. and the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 3) xv. 15. 

नाय
नाय
 in two passages of the Rigveda 1) vi. 24, 10; 46, 11. is, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, probably a proper name. Sa1yan2a takes the word to mean ‘leader,’ while Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 41. For other explanations, see Oldenberg, R2gvedaNoten, 1, 123, 370. considers it a gerund with passive sense.

नारद
नारद
 is the name of a mythical seer mentioned several times in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 19, 9; xii. 4, 16. 24. 41. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a he appears in conjunction with Parvata as priest of Haris4candra, 2) vii. 13. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 17. as teaching Somaka Sa1hadevya, 3) vii. 34. and as anointing A1mba1s2t2hya and Yudha1m2s4raus2t2i. 4) viii. 21. In the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 5) i. 5, 8. he is mentioned as a teacher, and in the Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a 6) iii. 9 (the Vam2s4a, or ‘list of teachers,’ at the end). as a pupil of Br2haspati. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 7) vii. 1, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 204, n. he is coupled with Sanatkuma1ra.

R2c), ‘(verse) celebrating men,’ is mentioned as early as the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 6. and is distinguished from Ga1tha1 in a number of passages in the later literature. 2) Av. xv. 6, 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 11, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 32; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, v. 5, 2; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 10, etc.; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 78. The passage, S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 6, 8, is uncertain. See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 98, n. 5. The Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 3) xiv. 5; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 98. while distinguishing the two, asserts that both are false (anr2tam). It is hardly probable that the two were absolutely distinct, for the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 4) i. 3, 2, 6. has the phrase ‘a Ga1tha1 celebrating men’ (na1ra1s4am2si1). What such verses were may be seen from the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 5) xvi. 11, 1 et seq.; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 10 et seq. which enumerates the Na1ra1s4am2sa1ni at the Purus2amedha, or ‘human sacrifice.’ They may legitimately be reckoned as a source of the epic. 6) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 264, n. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 100 (cf. Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 688, 689), lays stress rather on their character as mere eulogies of donors, and that, no doubt, was one of their sides; but the other elements may have been more prominent in reality than the priestly tradition shows. The term Na1ra1s4am2si1 is restricted in some passages 7) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 32; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 5. Possibly, in the other passages mentioned in note 2, the reference may be to the Atharvaveda verses, but this is not at all likely. to a particular group of three verses of the Atharvaveda, 8) xx. 127, 1-3 = S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 14, 1-3. Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 155. but Oldenberg 9) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 238. must be right in holding that the restricted sense is not to be read into the Rigveda. 10) x. 85, 6. Not even in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 11) vii. 5, 11, 2. is the technical sense certain, and the Br2haddevata1 12) iii. 154. Cf. Weber, Episches im Vedischen Ritual, 4 et seq. gives the word a general application.

नारी
नारी,
 ‘woman,’ occurs in the Rigveda 1) vii. 20, 5; 55, 8; viii. 77, 8; x. 18, 7; 86, 10. 11. and later. 2) Av. xiv. 2, 13; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 36; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 34. The word seems in the Rigveda 3) i. 73, 3 (pati-jus2t2a1, ‘dear to her husband’); vii. 20. 5; x. 18, 7 (avidhava1h2 supatni1h2, ‘not widowed, with noble husbands’), etc. to have a distinct reference to a woman as a wife, because it occurs in several passages with distinct reference to matrimonial relations, 3) i. 73, 3 (pati-jus2t2a1, ‘dear to her husband’); vii. 20. 5; x. 18, 7 (avidhava1h2 supatni1h2, ‘not widowed, with noble husbands’), etc. and in the later Vedic literature, where it is not common, it sometimes 4) Gautama Dharma Su1tra, ix. 28. has that sense. Delbru7ck, 5) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 417, 439. however, thinks that it does not indicate marital relations, but merely the woman as the sexual complement of the man.

नार्मर
नार्मर
 occurs once in a corrupt verse of the Rigveda. 1) ii. 13, 8. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152. regards the word as the proper name of the prince of a fort, U1rjayanti1, but Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. as that of a demon. 

नार्मिणी
नार्मिणी
 is found in the Rigveda 1) i. 149, 3. as an epithet of Pur, ‘fort’: it must apparently either be a proper name of the fort, 2) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204. or mean ‘belonging to Narmin or Narmin2a,’ some prince. 3) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Possibly the expression may consist of two words--na, ‘not’ or ‘like,’ and armin2i1, whatever that may mean. See Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 148; Sacred Books of the East, 46, 177.

नार्य
नार्य,
 ‘descendant of Narya,’ is the name of a generous donor in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 24, 29. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161, 162.

नार्षद
नार्षद,
 ‘descendant of Nr2s2ad,’ is the patronymic of Kan2va (i.e., a descendant of Kan2va) in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 19, 2. and in one passage of the Rigveda, 2) x. 31, 11. where probably the same man is referred to in another passage 3) i. 117, 8. as a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, and perhaps as the husband of Rus4ati1. But in a third passage of the Rigveda 4) x. 61, 13. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108, 150; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 397. the name seems applied to a demon, though this is not certain.

नावप्रभ्रंशन
नाव-प्रभ्रंशन,
 the ‘sliding down of the ship,’ is read in Whitney and Roth's text of the Atharvaveda, 1) xix. 39, 8, where the reading na1vaprabhra4m2s4ana is a conjectural emenda1tion, the manuscripts of the Sam2hita1 text all having two accents, na1vaprabhra4m2s4ana (one of them reading na1vah2-). and has been connected by Weber 2) Indische Streifen, 1, 11. and others 3) Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 218, n.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 30. with Manor Avasarpan2a, the name in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 4) i. 8, 1, 6. of the northern mountain on which Manu's ship settled on the subsidence of the deluge. But both Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 679. and Whitney 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 961. point out that this interpretation is highly improbable, and this view is accepted by Macdonell. 7) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 1107, where his acceptance of Weber's interpretation in his Sanskrit Literature, 144, is withdrawn. The expression is analyzed as na ava-prabhram2s4ana by the Pada text and the commentator alike, and is never found elsewhere with reference to the descent of a boat or ship. 8) The word nau, ship, never occurs as the first member of a compound in the form of na1va, while pra-bhram2s4, ‘fall down,’ is never used of the gliding down of a boat, and would be inappropriately applied in that sense.

नावा
नावा,
 ‘ship,’ occurs once in the Rigveda (i. 97, 8). See Nau.

नावाज
नावाज
 (‘ship-propeller’), a ‘boatman,’ is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (ii. 3, 3, 5).

नाव्या
नाव्या
 is found several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 33, 11; 80, 8; 121, 13. and the later literature 2) Av. viii. 5, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 5, 4, 14, etc. in the sense of a ‘navigable stream.’

नाहुष
नाहुष,
 like Nahus, means, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, in some passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 100, 16; v. 73, 3; vi. 22, 10; viii. 6, 24. ‘neighbouring’ as an adjective, and once 2) viii. 95, 2. as a substantive ‘neighbour.’ If, on the other hand, Nahus is taken as a proper name, then Na1hus2a no doubt denotes ‘belonging to the Nahus people,’ and, as a substantive, ‘King of the Nahus.’

निकोथकभायजात्य
निकोथक भाय-जात्य
 (‘descendant of Bhayaja1ta’) is mentioned in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 444. as a pupil of Pratithi.

निगदपार्णवल्कि
निगद पार्ण-वल्कि
 (‘descendant of Parn2avalka’) is mentioned in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 443. as a pupil of Giris4arman. 

निगुत्
नि-गुत्
 occurs in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) ix. 97, 53, 54; x. 128, 6. where Sa1yan2a takes it to mean ‘enemy,’ a possible interpretation. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 164. suggests that non-A1ryan foes are meant.

निगुस्थ
निगुस्थ
 is a term of unknown meaning applied in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xvi. 29, 6) to the peoples of Ka1s4i, Videha, and Kosala.

नितत्नी
1. Ni-tatni1, ‘striking downwards,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 136; probably 137 also refers to this plant. Cf. Kaus2i1taki Su1tra, xxxi. 28, with Caland's note in his translation; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 536, 537; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 383. as the name of an unknown plant which was used as a means of restoring the hair.

नितत्नी
2. Ni-tatni1 is the name of one of the seven Kr2ttika1s in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (iii. 1, 4, 1). See Naks2atra.

नितानमारुत
नि-तान मारुत
 is the name of a man in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 (xxv. 10).

निदाघ
नि-दाघ
 (‘burning down’), ‘summer,’ is the name of one of the seasons in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xiii. 8, 1, 4). See Naida1gha.

निदान
नि-दान
 is the name of a Su1tra, which is referred to in the Br2haddevata1 1) v. 23, with Macdonell's note. apparently as containing a quotation from the Bha1llavi Bra1hman2a. The quotation cannot be verified in the existing text of the Su1tra. 2) Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 65. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 111, etc. 

निधा
नि-धा,
 ‘net,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) ix. 83, 4; x. 73, 11; Nirukta, iv. 2. and later. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 19.

निधि
नि-धि
 means primarily ‘(place of) deposit,’ ‘store,’ 1) Rv. i. 183, 4; v. 43, 8; vii. 67, 7; 69, 3, etc. and then ‘treasure’ generally. 2) Rv. ii. 24, 6; viii. 29, 6; x. 68, 6; Av. x. 7, 23, etc. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 3) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. The St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Bo7ht2lingk in his edition, take daivo nidhih2 as one expression. See Daiva. Sa1yan2a takes each as a separate entity, and renders Nidhi as maha1ka1la1dinidhis4a1stram, presumably meaning some sort of chronology. Cf. for Nidhi as ‘treasure,’ Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 103, 104. Nidhi denotes some sort of science.

निनाह्य
नि-नाह्य
 denotes in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (iii. 9, 2, 8) a ‘water jar,’ so called, according to the commentator, because it was buried in the ground. 1) As meaning etymologically ‘to be fastened or fixed down.’ Eggeling 2) Sacred Books of the East, 26, 223, n. 4. explains it as ‘a vessel or cistern dug into the ground for keeping water cool.’

निन्दिताश्व
निन्दिताश्व
 (‘possessing contemptible steeds’) is the name of a patron in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 1, 30. The name may suggest connexion with Iran, but such a reference is not at all necessary. 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90. Cf. Ludwing, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. Sa1yan2a ingeniously turns the name--probably a nickname-into a compliment by rendering it ‘one who puts to shame the horses of his rivals.’

निपाद
नि-पाद
 in the Rigveda (v. 83, 7) denotes ‘low ground,’. ‘valley,’ as opposed to ‘hill’ (udvat). Cf. Nivat.

निम्रुच्
नि-म्रुच्,
 ‘sunset,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 151, 5; 161, 10; viii. 27, 19; x. 151, 5. and later 2) Av. xiii. 3, 21; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 10, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 10; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 5, 2, etc. as a division of time. 

निरष्ट
निर्-अष्ट,
 ‘castrated,’ is found in some of the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 9, 1; 17, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 4. 9. as applied to oxen, and in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 4, 2, 5. to horses.

निराल
निर्-आल
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 16, 3. where Sa1yan2a regards it as the name of a disease. Bloomfield, 2) Hymns of the Atharvave4da, 466. with the Padapa1t2ha, explains it as two words, understanding nir as an elliptical imperative, ‘(go) out,’ with the vocative a1la, a kind of weed. Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292. at first took a1la to be a verbal form, but finally came to the conclusion that the expression is one word, nira1la, of unknown sense.

निरुक्त
निरुक्त,
 ‘explanation’ of a word or passage, is found in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (viii. 3, 3), but does not appear as the name of a work before the later Upanis2ads. It is, however, probable that Ya1ska's Nirukta is not later than the rise of Buddhism. Cf. Nirvacana. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 13, 17; 3, 260 et seq.; Indian Literature, 25, 26, 41, 42, etc.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 269, 270; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 24, 25; Roth, Nirukta, xv. et seq.

निर्यास
निर्-यास
 denotes the ‘exudation’ of trees. In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (ii. 1, 5, 4) it is tabooed as food because of its red colour.

निर्वचन
निर्-वचन
 in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 1) i. 6, 3. and the Nirukta 2) ii. 1. Cf. a-nirvacanam, ‘not serving as an explanation,’ ibid., vii. 24. means ‘explanation,’ especially etymological. Cf. Nirukta.

निवत्
नि-वत्
 denotes ‘valley’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 11; iii. 2, 10; vii. 50, 4; x. 127, 2; 142, 4. and later. 2) Av. vi. 22, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 4; 4, etc. 

निवान्यवत्सा
निवान्य-वत्सा
 and Niva1nya1 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xii. 5, 1, 4. denotes a ‘cow with a calf to which she has to be won over,’ that is, with a calf substituted for one of her own which has died. Niva1nya1 2) ii. 6, 1, 6. is a contracted form of the compound term. Similar expressions are abhiva1nya-vatsa1, 3) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 2. abhiva1nya1, 4) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 8, 4. va1nya1, 5) Ibid., ii. 6, 16, 2. and apiva1nya-vatsa1. 6) Kaus4ika Su1tra, lxxxii. 22. Cf. Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 880.

निविद्
नि-विद्
 denotes a brief invocation of the deity that is invited in a liturgy in honour of the god. The Bra1hman2as 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 33. 34; iii. 10. 11; vi. 33. 35; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 3, 28; xiii. 5, 1. 9, etc.; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 5, 2; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, i. 3, etc. repeatedly mention Nivids as inserted in the S4astras (recitations), and the Khilas of the Rigveda 2) See Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 137-143. preserve among them a set of Nivids. But it is doubtful 3) The antiquity of the Nivids was asserted by Haug, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1, 26 et seq., and often since, e.g., by Tilak, Orion, 206; Scheftelowitz, op. cit., 3. It is shown to be most improbable by Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 265, 355, and Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 242 et seq.; Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1907, 232, 233. whether the habit of using such brief formulas--the Nivid is usually not more than a Pada or quarter-verse in length--is known to the Rigveda, though it has been seen even there, 4) i. 86, 4; Bezzenberger's Beitra7ge, 9, 192. So Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 119, 122, takes Rv. i. 96, 2, to refer to the Nivids in the technical sense, but not to the Nivids as preserved. and the word Nivid is several times found in that Sam2hita1, 5) i. 89, 3; 96, 2; 175, 6; ii. 36, 6; iv. 18, 7; vi. 67, 10. but hardly in the technical sense of the Bra1hman2as. In the later Sam2hita1s 6) Av. v. 26, 4; xi. 7, 19; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix, 25, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 102; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 387, n. 2; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 241. the technical sense is common.

निविद्धान
निविद्-धान,
 ‘containing a Nivid,’ is found several times as an epithet of a hymn or verse in the Bra1hman2as. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 17; Kaus2i1aki Bra1hman2a, xxi. 6; xxiv. 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 1, 12; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 2, 2; 5, 3. 

निवेशन
नि-वेशन,
 ‘dwelling,’ occurs in the Rigveda 1) iv. 19, 9; vii. 19, 5. and the Su1tras. In the latter 2) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 6, etc. the word is sometimes contrasted with Gr2ha as the resting-place of animals.

निषङ्गथि
नि-षङ्गथि
 1) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 11; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 2. or Nis2an3ga-dhi 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 10. is found in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. If the second form of the word is correct, the sense may be ‘sheath of a sword’ (nis2an3ga), as it is taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, but probably the first form is the correct one, the word then having the same meaning as Nis2an3gin.

निषङ्गिन्
नि-षङ्गिन्
 is found three times in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 30, 15; v. 57, 2; x. 103, 3. where, owing to its following in one passage 2) v. 57, 2. the words sudhanva1na is2umanto, ‘having good bows and arrows,’ the sense of nis2an3ginah2 as ‘having quivers’ seems quite certain. In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 3) xvi. 20. Cf. Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xx, 2, 11, with the commentator. it is taken by the commentator Mahi1dhara to mean ‘having a sword,’ a sense which is quite possible both there and in the other passages 4) Sa1maveda, ii. 1199; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 12; xxxvii. 11; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 3, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 2, 5. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 274. where it occurs. But the word far more probably means ‘having a quiver,’ for the bow was the Vedic weapon, not the sword (Asi).

निषाद
नि-षाद
 is found in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 4, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 27; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 11; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 6, 8, etc. The word seems to denote not so much a particular tribe, but to be the general term for the non-A1ryan tribes who were not under A1ryan control, as the S4u1dras were, for Aupamanyava 2) In Ya1ska, Nirukta, iii. 8. took the five peoples (pan5ca jana1h2) to be the four castes (catva1ro varn2a1h2) and the Nis2a1das, and the commentator Mahi1dhara explains the word where it occurs in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 3) xvi. 27. Cf. xxx. 8. as meaning a Bhilla, or Bhi1l. A village of Nis2a1das is mentioned in the La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 4) viii. 2, 8. and a Nis2a1da Sthapati, a leader of some kind, is referred to in the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra 5) i. 1, 12; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 13. and in a Bra1hman2a cited by the scholiast on that passage. Weber 6) Indische Studien, 9, 340. Cf. 10, 13, 16. thinks that the Nis2a1das were the settled aborigines (form ni, ‘down,’ and sad, ‘settle’), a view supported by the fact that the ritual of the Vis4vajit sacrifice 7) See Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxv. 15; La1t2ya1yana, loc. cit.; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. requires a temporary residence with Nis2a1das; for the Nis2a1das who would permit an A1ryan to reside temporarily amongst them must have been partially amenable to A1ryan influence. But the name might easily be applied to the whole body of aborigines outside the A1ryan organization. Von Schroeder 8) Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 366. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 39, 119. In the later system (Manu, x. 8) the Nis2a1da is the offspring of a Bra1hman2a and of a S4u1dra woman, while the Br2hatsam2hita1 of Vara1hamihira (xiv. 10) recognizes a kingdom (ra1s2t2ra) of Nis2a1das in the south-east of Madhyades4a. In the Pa1li texts (Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 12, 160, 206 et seq.) they are wild hunters and fishers. Cf. also Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 301, 303, 366, n. 164, 403, 481. thinks that the Nis2a1das were most probably identical with the Nysæans, who, according to the Greek account, sent an embassy to Alexander when he was in the territory of the As4vakas, but this identification is doubtful.

निष्क
निष्क
 is frequently found in the Rigveda 1) ii. 33, 10; viii. 47, 15. etc. and later 2) Av. v. 14, 3; vii. 99, 1; xx. 131. 8; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 2, 1. 2; v. 13, 2; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 36, 7. 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 1, 7. 11, etc. denoting a gold ornament worn on the neck, as is shown by the two epithets nis2ka-kan2t2ha 3) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 22. and nis2ka-gri1va, 4) Rv. v. 19, 3; Av. v. 17, 14. ‘having a gold ornament on the neck.’ A Nis2ka of silver is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 5) xvii. 1, 14, as worn by the Vra1tya Cf. Av. xv. 3. As early as the Rigveda 6) i. 126, 2. traces are seen of the use of Nis2kas as a sort of currency, for a singer celebrates the receipt of a hundred Nis2kas and a hundred steeds: he could hardly require the Nis2kas merely for purposes of personal adornment. Later the use of Nis2kas as currency is quite clear. 7) Av. xx. 127, 3; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 9, 20, etc. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 4, 1, 1. 8; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 6; the sense of ‘coin’ is seen by Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 50, 51, and by Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 185. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 51, 259, 263; Geldner, op. cit., 1, 268, n. 2; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 40, 127. Cf. also Kr2s2n2ala.

निष्किरीय
निष्किरीय
 is the name of a school of priests who are mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xii. 5, 14. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 58. as holding a Sattra, or ‘sacrificial session.’

नीच्य
नीच्य
 (‘living below’) is a designation of certain nations of the west. The Ni1cyas are mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 14) as distinguished from the people of Madhyades4a, and no doubt mean the inhabitants of the Indus and Panjab regions.

नृ
नृ
 See Nara.

नृति
नृति
 in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 18, 3. seems to mean a bag of skin. But though the Paippala1da recension has the same text, it is clear that we must read Dr2ti with Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Whitney. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 294. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 235; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 468. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 514. renders the word ‘dancer,’ which makes no sense in the context.

नृतू
नृतू
 occurs once in the Rigveda 1) i. 92, 4 (where Us2as, Goddess of Dawn, is compared to a dancer). denoting a female ‘dancer.’ In another passage 2) x. 18, 3. Cf. 29, 2. Nr2ti is found coupled with ha1sa, ‘laughter,’ in the description of the funeral ritual; but though it is clear that a joyful celebration is meant (like the Irish ‘wake’ or the old-fashioned feasting in Scotland after a funeral), it is difficult to be certain that actual dancing is here meant. Dancing is, however, often referred to in the Rigveda 3) i. 10, 1; 92, 4, etc. See Weber, Indian Literature, 196 et seq. and later. Nr2ttagi1ta, ‘dance and song,’ are mentioned in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a 4) i. 42 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 235). as found in the sixth world. See also S4ailu1s2a.

नृमेध
नृ-मेध,
 1) Rv. x. 80, 3; 132, 7; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 8, 3. Nr2-medhas, 2) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, viii. 8, 21 et seq. is the name of a prote4ge4 of Agni in the Rigveda, 3) x. 80, 3. where he also appears with Sumedhas in a hymn that Griffith 4) x. 132; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 578, n. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 61. with justice declares to be unintelligible. In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) Rv. x. 80, 3; 132, 7; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 8, 3. he is an unsuccessful rival of Parucchepa, and in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, viii. 8, 21 et seq. he is an A1n3girasa and a seer of Sa1mans (Chants).

 ‘sitting among men,’ is the name of the father of Kan2va in the Rigveda (x. 31, 11). Cf. Na1rs2ada.

नेक्षण
नेक्षण
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 6, 17. Cf. Kaus4ika Su1tra, ii. 11; lxxxvii. 12; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 540. where a ‘spit’ seems to be meant. In the Rigveda 2) i. 162, 13. Ni1ks2an2a occurs, and must have the same sense; Oldenberg 3) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 155. inclines to think that this word refers to the ‘inspection’ of food, to see if it is ready (as from ni-i1ks2, ‘look into’). 

नेमि
नेमि
 denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 15; 141, 9; ii. 5, 3; v. 13, 6; vii. 32, 20; viii. 46, 23; 75, 5, etc. and later 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 2, 15; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 5, 15, etc. the ‘felly’ of a chariot wheel. It was required to be of good wood (su-dru1), 3) Rv. vii. 32, 20. and was bent into shape. 4) Rv. viii. 75, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248. Cf. Ratha.

नैचाशाख
नैचा-शाख
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vii. 53, 4. where Sa1yan2a renders it as ‘of low origin,’ but elsewhere 2) See St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. he explains it as the name of a place. The former sense is accepted by Grassmann and Ludwig in their versions, and by Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 31. but Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-18; 2, 241245, where he opposes Bo7htlingk's view that it is a proper name. points out that the reference is rather to the ‘low-branched’ Soma plant. Cf. Ki1kat2a and Pramaganda.

नैचुदार
नैचु-दार
 occurs in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xxi. 4, 13. Cf. Anupada Su1tra, vi. 4. meaning ‘composed of the wood of the Nicuda1ra.’ What tree is meant by the latter name is unknown.

नैतन्धव
नैतन्धव
 is mentioned as a place on the Sarasvati1 in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xxv. 13, 1. and the Su1tras. 2) La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 19, 13; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiii. 29, 31; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxiv. 6, 23.

नैदान
नै-दान
 is a term applied in the Nirukta 1) vi. 9; vii. 12. to a class of Vedic interpreters. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But of. Nirukta, Erla1uterungen, 220, 221; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 176. takes the Naida1nas to be ‘etymologists,’ but Sieg 3) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 29. thinks they are the same as the Aitiha1sikas or ‘legendarists.’ 4) The word seems to mean ‘one concerned with the original form’ (nida1na).

नैध्रुवि
नै-ध्रुवि,
 ‘descendant of Nidhruva,’ is the patronymic of Kas4yapa in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) vi. 4, 33 (Ma1dhyandina = vi. 5, 3 Ka1n2va).

नैमिशि
 is the epithet of S4itiba1hu Ais2akr2ta in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a. 1) i. 363 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 192). It is probably to be taken as an indication that S4itiba1hu came from the Naimis4a forest.

नैमिशीय
नैमिशीय,
 1) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 6, 4; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 363 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 192). Naimis2i1ya 2) Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxvi. 5; xxviii. 4; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 2, 13; Naimis2ya, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 6 (Indische Studien, 3, 469). The cerebrals seems to be universal later. denotes the dwellers in the Naimis4a forest. They are mentioned in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 2) Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxvi. 5; xxviii. 4; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 2, 13; Naimis2ya, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 6 (Indische Studien, 3, 469). The cerebrals seems to be universal later. and the Bra1hman2as, 2) Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxvi. 5; xxviii. 4; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 2, 13; Naimis2ya, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 6 (Indische Studien, 3, 469). The cerebrals seems to be universal later. being clearly of special sanctity. Hence in the Epic the Maha1bha1rata is said to have been recited to the R2s2is dwelling in the Naimis2a forest. 3) Weber, Indian Literature, 34, 45, 54, 68, 70, 185.

नैरुक्त
नैर्-उक्त
 1) ‘One concerned with etymological explanation’ (nir-ukta). in the Nirukta 2) i. 12; vi. 11; xi. 19. 29. 31; xii. 10; xiii. 9. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 26, 85; Indische Studien, 2, 39, n.; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffc des R2gveda, 10-13; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 165 et seq. denotes a man who knows the true etymology of words, and explains their meaning accordingly. Ya1ska's Nirukta is the classic work of this school, and forms a commentary on an earlier Nirukta, the so-called Naighan2t2uka, a glossary consisting of five collections of Vedic words. 

नैषाद
नै-षाद,
 a ‘man of Nis2a1da,’ is mentioned in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a (xxv. 15) and the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (xxx. 8).

नैषिध
नैषिध
 is the reading in the S4ata atha Bra1hman2a (ii. 3, 2, 1. 2) of the epithet of Nad2a, a king of the south. The later form of the name is Nais2adha; the St. Petersburg Dictionarv suggests that its original form was Naih2s2idha.

नोधस्
नोधस्
 is the name of a poet who is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) i. 61, 14; 62, 13; 64, 1, and 124, 4, according to Nirukta, iv. 16. and to whom certain of its hymns are ascribed. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 18; Rv. i. 58-64 are ascribed to him in the Anukraman2i1 (Index). In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 3) vii. 10, 10; xxi. 9, 12. Cf. Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 27; viii. 12. 17; Av. xv. 2, 4; 4, 4. he is called Ka1ks2i1vata, a ‘descendant of Kaks2i1vant.’ Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110. regards him as contemporary with the defeat of Purukutsa. He was a Gotama. 5) Rv. i. 62, 13; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 125. For the controversy as to the meaning of Rv. i. 124, 4, see Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 137. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 33.

नौ
नौ
 is the regular word in the Rigveda 1) i. 131, 2; ii. 39, 4; viii. 42, 3; 83, 3, etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 36, 5; v. 19. 8; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 3, 10, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 19; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 13; vi. 6. 21; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 1, 4; iv. 2, 5, 10, etc. for a ‘boat’ or ‘ship.’ In the great majority of cases the ship was merely a boat for crossing rivers, though no doubt a large boat was needed for crossing many of the broad rivers of the Panjab as well as the Yamuna1 and Gan3ga1. Often no doubt the Nau was a mere dug-out canoe (da1ru). 3) Rv. x. 155, 3. It is certainly against the theory 4) Wilson, Rigveda, 1, xli. of the existence in Vedic times of an extensive sea trade that there is no mention of any of the parts of a ship, such as masts and sails, except the oar (Aritra), Yet there are some allusions indicating a trade more extensive than that implied by boats used for crossing rivers. The Atharvaveda 5) v. 19, 8. Cf. Hopkins, American Journal of Philology, 19, 139. So perhaps the passage, Rv. i. 32, 8, nadam2 na bhinnam, refers to a ship. See Nad2a. compares the ruin of a kingdom where Brahmins are oppressed to the sinking of a ship which is leaking (bhinna1); though the language here employed can be made to fit the theory that the ship was only a canoe, it cannot naturally be so interpreted. Moreover, there is mention made in the Rigveda 6) Rv. i. 56, 2; iv. 55, 6. of men who go to the ocean (Samudra) eager for gain (sanis2yavah2). It is not altogether satisfactory to restrict such references with Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 22, 23. to the broad stream of the Indus after the union of that river with the tributaries of the Panjab. In the Rigveda 8) i. 116, 3 et seq. too it is said that the As4vins rescued Bhujyu in the ocean with a ship of a hundred oars (s4ata1ritra). It is not easy to refuse to recognize here the existence of larger vessels with many oars used for sea voyages. The Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, 9) i. 2, 4; ii. 2, 2. But it is not of very early date. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 255-257. at any rate, clearly refers to maritime navigation. See also Samudra.

न्यग्रोध
न्यग्-रोध,
 ‘growing downwards,’ is the name of the Ficus indica, a tree remarkable for sending down from its branches fibres which take root and form new stems. Though the tree is not mentioned by name in the Rigveda, it appears to have been known, as Pischel 1) Vedische Studien, 1, 113, 114. has shown from a hymn 2) i. 24, 7, where stu1pa seems to denote the crest or crown of the tree above the main trunk. in which its characteristics may be recognized. It is frequently mentioned in the Atharvaveda 3) iv. 37, 4; v. 5, 5. and the later literature. 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 30. 31; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 5, 13 xiii. 2, 7, 3; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 12, 1, etc. The sacrificial bowls (Camasa) were made of its wood. 5) Taittiri1ya Samhita1, vii. 4, 12, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 58. It was doubtless of the greatest importance, as in modern times, to the Vedic village. The sister tree, the As4vattha (Ficus religiosa), already occurs in the Rigveda.

न्यङ्क
न्य्-अङ्क
 in the dual denotes in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) i. 7, 7, 2. and Bra1hman2a 2) i. 3, 5, 4; ii. 7, 8, 1. some part of the chariot, parallel with An3ka. The Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 3) i. 7, 5; La1t2ya1yana Srauta Su1tra, ii. 8, 9. has Nyan3ku1, the dual of Nyan3ku. 

न्यङ्कु
न्यङ्कु
 is the name of an animal in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 27. 32. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83. The metre nyan3ku-sa1rin2i1, ‘with a gazelle's gait,’ is already mentioned in the R2gveda Pra1tis4a1khya, xvi. 31; Chandas, 5; Nida1na Su1tra, i. 2. It seems clear that a kind a ‘gazelle’ is meant, but the commentary on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 27. 32. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83. The metre nyan3ku-sa1rin2i1, ‘with a gazelle's gait,’ is already mentioned in the R2gveda Pra1tis4a1khya, xvi. 31; Chandas, 5; Nida1na Su1tra, i. 2. suggests ‘bear’ (r2ks2a) as a variant rendering.

न्यस्तिका
न्य्-अस्तिका
 seems in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 139, 1. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 385; Bloomfield, ymns of the Atharvaveda, 539, 540. to denote a plant of some kind, identified by the scholiast with the S4an3khapus2pika1 (Andropogon aciculatus).

न्योचनी
न्य्-ओचनी
 is found in the marriage hymn of the Rigveda (x. 85, 6), where some kind of ornament worn by women seems to be meant. The commentator Sa1yan2a interprets it as ‘female slave.’ P.

पक्ति
पक्ति
 denotes a cooked object, probably a kind of ‘cake,’ in the Sam2hita1s. 1) Rv. iv. 24, 5. 7; 25, 6. 7; vi. 29, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 59, etc. One who cooks food is called Paktr2. 2) Av. x. 9, 7. 11. 25; xi. 1, 17; xii. 3, 17; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 17; x. 4, 2, 19.

पक्थ
पक्थ
 is the name of a people in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 18. 7. where they appear as one of the tribes that opposed 2) Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95, thought that the Pakthas were allies of the Trtsus, but this view is certainly incorrect. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260. the Tr2tsu-Bharatas in the Da1s4ara1jn5a. or ‘battle of the ten kings.’ Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 430, 431. compares them with the tribe of  and their country , mentioned as in the north-west of India by Herodotus, 4) vii. 65 (); iii. 102 and iv. 44 (). and with the modern Pakhthu1n in Eastern Afghanistan, holding that they were a northern tribe; this is probable, since the Bharatas seem to have occupied the Madhyades4a, or ‘Middle Land.’ In three passages of the Rigveda 5) viii. 22, 10; 49, 10; x. 61, 1. a Paktha is referred to as a prote4ge4 of the As4vins. The second connects him with Trasadasyu, whose tribe, the Pu1rus, were aided by the Pakthas in their unsuccessful onslaught on Suda1s. In the third passage he seems specified as Tu1rva1yan2a, and appears as an opponent of Cyava1na. 6) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 71-77. Probably, therefore, Paktha in all cases denotes the king of the Paktha people.

पक्व
पक्व,
 ‘cooked,’ is used substantively as meaning ‘cooked food’ 1) Rv. vi. 63, 9; Av. vi. 119, 2; xii. 3, 55; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 1, 26; ii. 6, 1, 7, etc. or ‘cooked milk.’ 2) Rv. i. 62, 9; 180, 3; ii. 40, 2; iii. 30, 14; vi. 44, 24, etc. The word is also used of ‘baked’ bricks. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 2, 22; vii. 2, 1, 7.

पक्ष
पक्ष
 is, in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 3, 4. applied to some part of a house, either the ‘side posts,’ according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 153. and Grill, 4) Hundert Lieder^2, 188. or ‘sides,’ as understood by Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 526. and Bloomfield. 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 597. The description of the roof (Chadis) in the Atharvaveda 7) iii. 7, 3. as catus2-paks2a, ‘four-sided,’ tells in favour of the second explanation. In the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 8) i. 5, 12, 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 210. Paks2a is used of the sides of a chariot. For Paks2a as the ‘half’ of a month, see Ma1sa.

 is found in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 8, 22. and the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 2) vii. 7. meaning the ‘sides’ 3) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 506; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 117. of a chariot. In the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 4) xxx. 5. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 5) i. 2, 3, 1. it is used of the sides of a hut or chamber (S4a1la1). In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 6) xxix. 5. it means the ‘wing’ of a door. In the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 7) ii. 9. the ‘half’ of an army is so named, and in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 8) xxiii. 6, 6. it means the ‘half’ of a month, or ‘fortnight.’ Cf. Paks2a.

पक्षिन्
पक्षिन्
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 48. 5; 182, 5; x. 127, 5, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 34, 4; xi. 5, 21; xii. 1, 51; xiii. 2, 33; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 8; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 23; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 5, 18, etc. denotes a ‘winged’ creature, more particularly a ‘bird.’

पङ्क्ति
पङ्क्ति,
 originally a ‘set of five,’ denotes as early as the Rigveda 1) x. 117, 8, as taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary. a ‘series’ generally. In the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 2) x. 38, 39. the word is used of the series of a man's ancestors whom he purifies by certain conduct.

पचत
पचत,
 like Pakti, denotes ‘cooked food’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 61, 7; x. 116, 8. and later. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 60; xxiii. 13; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, viii. 21, etc.

 in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 6. and the S4atapatha Bra1haman2a 2) vi. 5, 43, 3. 4; xiv. 1, 2, 21. denotes a ‘vessel for cooking’ food. 

पज्र
पज्र
 is the name of the family from which Kaks2i1vant sprang (Pajriya). It is mentioned several times in the Rigveda. 1) i. 117, 10; 122, 7. 8; 126, 4. 5. According to Pischel, 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 97, 98. the epithet pr2ks2a-ya1ma 3) Rv. i. 127, 8, where Roth (St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.) thinks this compound is probably a proper name. applied to them means ‘carrying out brilliant sacrificial performances,’ which won for them S4rutaratha's generosity. In two passages 4) Rv. viii. 4, 17; 6, 47. Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. pajra. sees a Pajra called Sa1man3. This is uncertain, but in any case a Pajra seems clearly alluded to. Elsewhere 6) Rv. i. 190, 5, where the reference is clearly hostile and contemptuous. it is very doubtful whether the word is a proper name at all. In the S4a1t2ya1yana 7) Cited by Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 51, 4. the Pajras are declared to be An3girases.

पज्रा
पज्रा
 occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) ix. 82, 14. where Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110. sees in the word the name of the wife of the sacrificer, Pajra, while Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. pajra. takes it to be an epithet (‘stout’) of the Soma plant. The sense is thus uncertain.

पज्रिय
पज्रिय
 ‘descendant of Pajra,’ is the patronymic 1) Cf. Tugrya, n. 1. of Kaks2i1vant in the Rigveda. 2) i. 116, 7; 117, 6; 120, 5.

पञ्चजनाः
पञ्च-जनाः,
 the ‘five peoples,’ are mentioned under various names in Vedic literature. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 31; iv. 27; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 1, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, v. 6; xxxii. 6; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 2, 9 (pan5ca-jana1h2 as a compound). See also pan5ca ma1nus2a1h2, Rv. viii. 9, 2; ma1nava1h2, Av. iii. 21, 5; 24, 3; xii. 1, 15; jana1h2, Rv. iii. 37, 9; 59, 8; vi. 14, 4; viii. 32, 22; ix. 65, 23; 92, 3; x. 45, 6; kr2s2t2ayah2, ii. 2, 10; iii. 53, 16; iv. 38, 10; x. 60, 4; 119, 6; Av. iii. 24, 3; ks2itayah2, Rv. i. 7, 9; 176, 3; v. 35, 2; vi. 46, 7; vii. 75, 4; 79, 1; cars2an2yah2, Rv. v. 86, 2; vii. 15, 2; ix. 101, 9. See Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204. Every book of the Rigveda has a mention of the five peoples: one such in ii. and iv.; two in i., v., vi., vii., viii.; three in iii. and ix.; four in x. Who are meant by the five is very uncertain. The Aitareya Bra1hman2a 2) iii. 31. explains the five to be gods, men, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, and the Fathers. Aupamanyava 3) In Ya1ska, Nirukta, iii. 8. held that the four castes (Varn2a) and the Nis2a1das made up the five, and Sa1yan2a 4) On Rv. i. 7, 9, etc. is of the same opinion. Ya1ska 5) Nirukta, loc. cit. thinks that the five are the Gandharvas, fathers, gods, Asuras, and Raks2ases. No one of these explanations can be regarded as probable. Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. kr2s2t2i, Nirukta, Erla7uterungen, 28. For his view, Av. iii. 24, 3, can be cited: pan5ca pradis4o ma1navi1h2 pan5ca kr2s2t2ayah2, ‘the five directions, the five races of men.’ and Geldner 7) Siebenzig Lieder, 18. See, however, R2gveda, Glossar, 103, where he recognizes the use of the phrase to denote five tribes, as well as all mankind. think that all the peoples of the earth are me4ant: just as there are four quarters (Dis4), there are peoples at the four quarters (N. E. S. W.), with the A1ryan folk in the middle. Zimmer 8) Altindisches Leben, 119-123. His view is accepted by Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 153; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 179, is doubtful. opposes this view on the ground that the inclusion of all peoples in one expression is not in harmony with the distinction so often made between A1ryan and Da1sa; that neither jana1sah2, ‘men,’ 9) Cf. its use in Rv. ii. 12, sa jana1sa Indrah2, where the address must be to A1ryan men. nor ma1nus2a1h2, ‘people,’ 10) Cf. Rv. viii. 9, 2, and i. 52, 9, with viii. 70, 11; x. 28, 8. could be used of non-A1ryans; that the Soma is referred to as being among the five tribes; 11) Rv. ix. 65, 23. that the five tribes are mentioned as on the Sarasvati1, 12) Rv. vi. 61, 12 (pan5ca ja1ta1). Cf. x. 53, 4. and that Indra is pa1n5cajanya, 13) v. 32, 11. Agni is ‘of the five tribes,’ Rv. ix. 66, 20. Atri also is so described, Rv. i. 117, 3. ‘belonging to the five peoples.’ He concludes that A1ryans alone are meant, and in particular the five tribes of the Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvas4as, and Pu1rus, who are all mentioned together in one or perhaps two hymns of the Rigveda, 14) Rv. i. 108, 8. In vii. 18, cited by Zimmer, 122, the five tribes do not occur eo nomine, for Yaks2u replaces Yadu. But it is probable that Yadu is meant by Yaks2u. and four of whom occur in another hymn. 15) Rv. viii. 10, 5. But he admits that the expression might easily be used more generally later. Hopkins 16) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260. has combated Zimmer's view, but his own opinion rests mainly on his theory that there was no people named Turvas4a, but only a king of the Yadus called Turvas4a, and that theory is not very probable. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 17) xiii. 5, 4, 14. and the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 18) viii. 23. the five peoples are opposed to the Bharatas, and in the former work 19) It is a conjecture of Weber's, Indische Studien, 1, 202, that the five peoples are identical with the Pan5ca1las, and the seven mentioned in Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 23, with the Kuru-Pan5ca1las. seven peoples are alluded to.

पञ्चदशी
पञ्च-दशी,
 ‘the fifteenth day of the month,’ is already mentioned in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (i. 5, 10, 5).

पञ्चनद
पञ्च-नद,
 ‘having five streams,’ is not found until the epic period as the name of the Panja1b, which has no designation in the earlier literature. The importance of the Panja1b as the home 1) See, e.g., Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 32 et seq. of the Rigveda has been greatly diminished by recent research, Hopkins, 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 19-28. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 145, 441. Pischel, 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 218. and Geldner 4) Ibid., 3, 152. having on different grounds shown reason for believing that the Rigveda, at least in great part, was composed farther east, in the Madhyades4a, which admittedly was the home of the later Vedic culture. Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 98 et seq. But see Divoda1sa. Cf. also Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 189. considers that the Rigveda belongs in part to the Panja1b, or rather to Arachosia, and in part to the Middle Country. See also Kuru, Tr2tsu.

पञ्चाल
पञ्चाल
 is the later name 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 7. of the people called Krivi in the Rigveda. The Pan5ca1las are rarely referred to except in connexion with the Kurus, and the kings of the Kuru-Pan5ca1las are mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 2) viii. 14 In the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 3) xxx. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 471). the Pan5ca1las appear as the people of Kes4in Da1lbhya. In the Upanis2ads and later 4) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 1 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 2, 1 Ka1n2va); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 3, 1; R2gveda Pra1tis4a1khya, ii. 12, 44; Nida1na Su1tra, i. 6; Sa1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 13, 6, etc. the Brahmins of the Pan5ca1las figure as taking part in philosophical and philological discussions. The Sam2hitopanis2ad Bra1hman2a 5) 2. Cf. Indische Studien, 4, 375, n.; 8, 92, n. 1. makes mention of the Pra1cya-Pan5ca1las. The Pan5ca1las, no doubt, included other tribes besides the Krivis. The name seems to refer to five tribes, and it has been suggested 6) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 202; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 108, n. 1. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 1, 191 et seq.; Indian Literature, 10, 90, 114, 115, 125, 135, 136. that the Pan5ca1las represent the five tribes of the Rigveda, but the suggestion is not very probable. There is no trace in Vedic literature of the Epic division of the Pan5ca1las into northern (uttara) and southern (daks2in2a). The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 7) xiii. 5, 4, 7. mentions their town Paricakra1; other towns to which allusion seems to be made were Ka1mpi1la and kaus4a1mbi1. 8) See Kaus4a1mbeya. Of their kings and chiefs, as distinguished from kings of the Kuru-Pan5ca1las, we hear of Kraivya, Durmukha, Prava1han2a Jaivali, and S4ona.

पञ्चालचण्ड
पञ्चाल-चण्ड
 is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya 1) iii. 1, 6. and the S4a1n3kha1yana 2) vii. 18. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391; Indian Literature, 50, 315, 326. A1ran2yakas.

पञ्चावि
पञ्चावि
 occurs several times in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xviii. 26; xxi. 14; xxiv. 12; xxviii. 26. in the sense of ‘aged five lamb-periods’ (of six months), that is, ‘thirty months old.’ 2) Cf. Tryavi.

पञ्चौदन
पञ्चौदन
 is an adjective in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 14, 7; ix. 5, 8 et seq. meaning ‘prepared with five rice-messes.’ The cooking of five rice dishes is referred to in the same Sam2hita1. 2) ix. 5, 37. 

पटल
पटल
 as early as the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) i. 21. 22. denotes ‘section’ of a work, a sense occurring in the Su1tras 2) S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xi. 9. 20; xiii. 21, 2; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 6. 7. and later.

पठर्वन्
पठर्वन्
 appears to be the name of a man in the Rigveda. 1) i. 112, 17, with Sa1yan2a's note. According to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 147, 148. however, the word is Pat2haru, and is the name of a fort which was saved by a rain-storm from being set on fire.

पड्गृभि
पड्गृभि,
 ‘seizing by the foot,’ 1) But it may mean ‘seizing with a cord.’ Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 34 (top); Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 236. is the name in the Rigveda 2) x. 49, 5. of either a man 3) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. or a demon. See also Pad2bi1s4a.

पड्बीश
पड्-बीश,
 the ‘foot-fetter’ of a horse in five passages, two in the Rigveda, 1) i. 162, 14. 16 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 9, 1. 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxv. 38. 39. and one each in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 2) vi. 2, 13 (Ma1dhyam2dina). the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 3) v. 1, 12. and the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka. 4) ix. 7; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 57, n. 3. Elsewhere 5) Rv. x. 97, 16; Av. viii. 1, 4; xii. 5, 15; xvi. 8, 27; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 10, 3; Mantra Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 10. its uses are metaphorical. According to Roth, 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the literal sense is ‘foot-fastening’ (pad2 being = pad, ‘foot,’ and bi1s4a, written vi1s4a in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, being connected with the Latin vincire, ‘bind’). Pischel 7) Vedische Studien, 1, 233-236. objects that the sense of ‘foot-fastening’ involves the absurdity, in the Upanis2ad passages, of a fine horse from the Sindhu (Indus) being spoken of as tearing up the peg to which it is fastened. He suggests instead the meaning of ‘hobble,’ which must be right. 8) He explains the first part of the word as derived from pas4, ‘tie.’ Cf. Macdoneli, Vedic Grammar, p. 34 (top). But the form pad2 may be due to a false analogy, and the sense of ‘footfastener’ may express ‘hobble’ quite satisfactorily; it is not confined to a rope tied to a peg in the ground. 

पण
पण,
 with Pratipan2a, is found in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 15, 4. 6 (in the Paippala1da recension; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 112). denoting the process of bargaining and selling. The root pan2, from which the word is derived, is employed in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as, 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 55; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 3, 1 et seq.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 27. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 10, 1. while Pan2ana in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) iii. 3, 2, 19. The root does not occur in the Rigveda, but its etymology is vouched for by the Greek , Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 84, n. 3. denotes ‘trafficking.’ Cf. Van2ij.

पणि
पणि
 in the Rigveda appears to denote a person who is rich, but who does not give offerings to the gods, or bestow Daks2in2a1s on the priests, and who is therefore an object of intense dislike to the composers of the Sam2hita1. 1) Rv. i. 33, 3; 83, 2; 151, 9; 180, 7; iv. 28, 7; v. 34, 5-7; 61, 8; vi. 13, 3; 53, 3; viii. 64, 2; 97, 2; x. 60, 6; Av. v. 11, 7; xx. 128, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxv. 1. Hence the gods are asked to attack the Pan2is, who are also referred to as being defeated with slaughter. 2) Rv. 1, 83, 4; 184, 2; iii. 58, 2; v. 34, 7; 61, 8; vi. 13, 3; 20, 4; 33, 2; viii. 64, 11. The Pan2i is opposed to the pious sacrificer as a niggard, 3) Rv. i. 124, 10; iv. 51, 3; viii. 45, 14 (where the sense is doubtful). Cf. i. 93, 4; v. 61, 1. and is spoken of as a wolf, 4) Rv. vi. 51, 14. the symbol of enmity. In some passages 5) Rv. i. 32, 11; ii. 24, 6; iv. 58, 4; vi. 44, 22; vii. 9, 2; x. 67, 6; 92, 3; Av. iv. 23, 5; xix. 46, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 8, 2, 3. It is impossible definitely to decide in which passages the mythical sense is meant, Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 157. the Pan2is definitely appear as mythological figures, demons who withhold the cows or waters of heaven, and to whom Sarama1 goes on a mission from Indra. 6) Rv. x. 108. Among the Pan2is Br2bu was apparently important. In one passage of the Rigveda 7) Rv. viii. 66, 10. they are described as Bekana1t2as, or ‘usurers’ (?). In another 8) Rv. vii. 6, 3. they are called Dasyus, and styled mr2dhra-va1c, probably ‘of hostile speech,’ and grathin, a word of uncertain meaning. Hillebrandt 9) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 89. thinks that the latter epithet refers to the continuous flow of a speech which is not understood, and that mr2dhra-va1c means ‘s4peaking an enemy's speech,’ though not necessarily with reference to non-A1ryans. 10) See Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 1, 23; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 114; Davidson, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 37, 23; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 31, n. 3. In two passages 11) Rv. v. 34, 5-7; Av. v. 11, 6. the Pan2is appear as Da1sas, and in one 12) Rv. v. 61, 8. Cf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 41, 673; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 361, who thinks that the Pan2i is compared unfavourably with a generous woman, but this is unlikely; Hillebrandt, 1, 92, n. 3; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 58, 59 Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 364. a Pan2i is mentioned in connexion with wergeld (Vaira), being apparently regarded as equal to a man merely in the price put on his life, but in other respects as inferior. It is difficult to be certain exactly who a Pan2i was. Roth 13) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Ya1ska, Nirukta, ii. 17; vi. 26. thinks that the word is derived from pan2, ‘barter,’ and that the Pan2i is properly the man who will give nothing without return, hence the niggard, who neither worships the gods nor rewards their priests. This view is accepted by Zimmer 14) Altindisches Leben, 257. Cf. Macdonell, loc. cit.; Geldner, R2gveda, Glossar, 103. and by Ludwig. 15) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 213215. Cf. Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 319. The latter scholar thinks the apparent references to fights with Pan2is are to be explained by their having been aboriginal traders who went in caravans--as in Arabia and Northern Africa--prepared to fight, if need be, to protect their goods against attacks which the A1ryans would naturally deem quite justified. He supports this explanation by the references to the Pan2is as Dasyus and Da1sas. It is, however, hardly necessary to do more than regard the Pan2is generally as non-worshippers of the gods favoured by the singers; the term is wide enough to cover either the aborigines or hostile A1ryan tribes, as well as demons. Hillebrandt, 16) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 83 et seq.; 3, 268; Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1894, 648. however, thinks that a real tribe is meant, the Parnians of Strabo, and that they were associated with the Dahae (Da1sa). Moreover, he finds them associated in one passage 17) Rv. vi. 61, 1-3. with the Pa1ra1vatas, whom he identifies with the  of Ptolemy, 18) vi. 20, 3. and with Br2s2aya, whom he connects with  of Arrian; 19) iii. 8, 4. he also considers that the frequent 20) The Pan2is occur twelve times in Man2d2ala vi.; once each in ii. and viii.; twice in v. and ix.; thrice in iv. and vii.; six times in viii.; nine times in i.; and four times in x., besides the references in the Sarama1 hymn, x. 108. mention of the Pan2is as opponents of Divoda1sa shows that the latter was on the Arachosian Haraqaiti (Sarasvati1) fighting against the Parnians and Dahae, as well as other Iranian tribes. But the identification of Pan2i and the Parnians is needless, especially as the root pan2, which is found also in the Greek , shows a satisfactory derivation, while the transfer of Divoda1sa to the Haraqaiti is improbable. See also Divoda1sa and Bekana1t2a.

 denotes a ‘flying creature’ generally in the Aitareya Upanis2ad, 1) iii. 3, 3. or more particularly a ‘bird’ in the Atharvaveda. 2) viii. 7, 24; x. 10, 14; xiv. 2, 44.

पताका

 --Under these words denoting primarily, as the evidence collected in the St. Petersburg Dictionary shows, ‘lord’ and ‘lady,’ and so ‘husband’ and ‘wife,’ it is convenient to consider the marital relations of the Vedic community. Child Marriage.--Marriage in the early Vedic texts appears essentially as a union of two persons of full development. This is shown by the numerous references 1) Cf. Rv. i. 117, 7; ii. 17, 7; x. 39, 3; 40, 5. Ghos2a1 is the chief example of this condition. The Atharvaveda (i. 14) also refers to such a case (see Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 253). The ornaments of maidens, especially at seasons of festival, are referred to in Rv. i. 123, 11; vii. 2, 5; Av. ii. 36, 1; xiv. 2, 59 et seq. to unmarried girls who grow old in the house of their fathers (ama1-jur), and who adorn themselves in desire of marriage, as well as to the paraphernalia of spells and potions used in the Atharvavedic tradition 2) Cf. Av. iii. 18 (= Rv. x. 145); vi. 89; 102; 130; 131; vii. 36; 37; 38. Similarly there are many references to the love of the youth for the maiden, and his seeking her--e.g., Rv. i. 115, 2; Av. ii. 30; iii. 25; vi. 8; 9; 82; to their mutual affection--e.g., Rv. i. 167, 3; ix. 32, 5; 56, 3; x. 34, 5; and to jealousy and love philtres for the purpose of recalling wandering affections -e.g., Av. vi. 18; 42; 43; 94; 139; vii. 45. The gifts of the lover are referred to in Rv. i. 117, 18. Some of these passages may, of course, refer to Hetairai, but not all. to compel the love of man or woman respectively, while even the Rigveda 3) vii. 55, 5. 8. Cf. Rv. i. 134, 3; Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 337 et seq. A different view of the passage is taken by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 57 et seq. The Atharvaveda (iv. 5) shows that the view of Aufrecht was that early adopted in India. itself seems to present us with a spell by which a lover seeks to send all the household to sleep when he visits his beloved. Child wives first occur regularly in the Su1tra period, though it is still uncertain to what extent the rule of marriage before puberty there obtained. 4) Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 59; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 340 et seq.; 23, 356; Risley, People of India, 179 et seq. There is a possible reference to a child-wife in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 10, 1. For the Su1tra evidence, see Bhandarkar, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 47, 143-156; Jolly, ibid., 46, 413-426; 47, 610-615. The marriage ritual also quite clearly presumes that the marriage is a real and not a nominal one: an essential feature is the taking of the bride to her husband's home, and the ensuing cohabitation. 5) Rv. x. 85, especially verse 29 et seq. Limitations on Marriage.--It is difficult to say with certainty within what limits marriage was allowed. The dialogue of Yama and Yami1 in the Rigveda 6) x. 10. seems clearly to point to a prohibition of the marriage of brother and sister. It can hardly be said, as Weber 7) Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 822. Cf. also Indische Studien, 5, 427; 10, 76, n.; Pischel, Hermes, 18, 465-468; Max Mu7ller, Science of Language, 2, 507; Herodotus, iii. 19. Crawley's Mystic Rose gives strong reasons against the early prevalence of such marriages. thinks, to point to a practice that was once in use and later became antiquated. In the Gobhila Gr2hya Su1tra 8) iii. 4, 5. and the Dharma Su1tras 9) A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, ii. 5, 15, 16, etc. Cf. Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra, iii. 5; Ya1jn5avalkya Dharma S4a1stra, i. 52, 53. are found prohibitions against marriage in the Gotra (‘family’) or within six degrees on the mother's or father's side, but in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 10) i. 8, 3, 6. marriage is allowed in the third or fourth generation, the former being allowed, according to Harisvamin, 11) On S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. by the Ka1n2vas, and the second by the Saura1s2t2ras, while the Da1ks2in2a1tyas allowed marriage with the daughter of the mother's brother or the son of the father's sister, but presumably not with the daughter of the mother's sister or the son of the father's brother. The prohibition of marriage within the Gotra cannot then have existed, 12) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 75, 76; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 387; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 392; Geiger, Ostiranische Kultur, 246; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 43, 308-312; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 62, 63; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 345 et seq. though naturally marriages outside the Gotra were frequent. 13) Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 51, 279. Similarity of caste was also not an essential to marriage, as hypergamy was permitted even by the Dharma Su1tras, 14) Gautama Dharma Su1tra, iv. 16; Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, i. 16, 2-5; Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, i. 24; 25; Pa1raskara Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 4, etc.; Risley, People of India, 156 et seq. Cf. Varn2a. so that a Bra1hman2a could marry wives of any lower caste, a Ks2atriya wives of the two lowest castes as well as of his own caste, a Vais4ya a S4u1dra1 as well as a Vais4ya1, although the S4u1dra1 marriages were later disapproved in toto. Instances of such intermarriage are common in the Epic, and are viewed as normal in the Br2haddevata1. 15) See Hopkins, cited in note 12; Br2haddevata1, v. 79; and Varn2a. It was considered proper that the younger brothers and sisters should not anticipate their elders by marrying before them. The later Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as 16) See Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 578 et seq. present a series of names expressive of such anticipation, censuring as sinful those who bear them. These terms are the pari-vivida1na, 17) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 9, and Ka1t2haka and Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1s, cited by Delbru7ck, 579, 580; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 9. In A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, ii. 5, 12, 22, the expression is parya1hita. or perhaps agre-dadhus, 18) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 9, according to Delbru1ck, 581. But, as pari-vivida1na follows, it seems very doubtful; the reading is probably wrong, especially in view of the Ka1t2haka and Kapis2t2hala parallels, which have agre-didhis2au and agre-dadhis2au. the man who, though a younger brother, marries before his elder brother, the latter being then called the parivitta; 19) See passages cited in note 17; also Av. vi. 112, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 11. A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 12, 11, and Dharma Su1tra, ii. 5, 12, 22, add parivinna to parivitta, but probably the two words should be identical in sense. the agre-didhis2u, 20) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 (see note 17) has agre-didhis2u; Kapis2t2hala, agre-dadhis2u; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 11, agra-didhis2u. The Dharma Su1tras adopt agre-didhis2u. the man who weds a younger daughter while her elder sister is still unmarried; and the Didhis2u1-pati, 21) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 has didhis2u1-pati; Kapis2t2hala, dadhis2u1-pati; and so the Dharma Su1tras. Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 9, has the corrupt edidhis2uh2-pati. who is the husband of the latter. The passages do not explicitly say that the exact order of birth must always be followed, but the mention of the terms shows that the order was often broken. Widow Remarriage.--The remarriage of a widow was apparently permitted. This seems originally to have taken the form of the marriage of the widow to the brother or other nearest kinsman of the dead man in order to produce children. At any rate, the ceremony is apparently alluded to in a funeral hymn of the Rigveda; 22) x. 18, 8. for the alternative explanation, which sees in the verse a reference to the ritual of the Purus2amendha (‘human sacrifice’), although accepted by Hillebrandt 23) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 40, 708. and Delbru7ck, 24) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 553. Cf. also Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 385; for the other view, see Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 848; Roth, Siebenzig Lieder, 151, n.; Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 329. is not at all probable, while the ordinary view is supported by the Su1tra evidence. 25) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 2, 18. Cf. Lanman in Whitney, op. cit., 849. Moreover, another passage of the Rigveda 26) x. 40, 2. clearly refers to the marriage of the widow and the husband's brother (devr2), which constitutes what the Indians later knew as Niyoga. 27) Cf. Ya1ska, Nirukta, iii. 15, with Roth's note; Geldner, R2gveda, Kommentar, 160; Weber, Indische Studien, v, 343, n.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 355, n., 367; Jolly, R2echt und Sitte, 71; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 459; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 429. The custom died out in later times, is seems. This custom was probably not followed except in cases where no son was already born. This custom was hardly remarriage in the strict sense, since the brother might--so far as appears--be already married himself. In the Atharvaveda, 28) ix. 5, 27. 28. a verse refers to a charm which would secure the reunion, in the next world, of a wife and her second husband. Though, as Delbru7ck 29) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 553-555. Cf. Jolly, Rechtund Sitte, 59; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 371, n. thinks, this very possibly refers to a case in which the first husband was still alive, 30) This is certainly the case in Av. v. 17, 8, which, however, merely exalts the sanctity of the Bra1hman2a, and does not necessarily imply remarriage at all. but was impotent or had lost caste (patita), 31) E.g., Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, ii. 2, 3, 27. still it is certain that the later Dharma Su1tras 32) Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, xvii. 19. 20. 72-74; Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, iv. 1, 16; Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra, ix. 175. Cf. also Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 281; 5, 306. began to recognize ordinary remarriage in case of the death of the first husband. Pischel 33) Vedische Studien, 1, 27. finds some evidence in the Rigveda 34) vi. 49, 8. Cf. Maha1bha1rata, iii. 70, 26. to the effect that a woman could remarry if her husband disappeared and could not be found or heard of. Polygamy.--A Vedic Indian could have more than one wife. This is proved clearly by many passages in the Rigveda; 35) Rv. i. 62, 11; 71, 1; 104, 3; 105, 8; 112, 19; 186, 7; vi. 53, 4; vii. 18, 2; 26, 3; x. 43, 1; 101, 11. Cf. Av. iii. 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 1, 4, etc. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 455 et seq.; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 387; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 64; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 430, 431; Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 539, 540; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 353; Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 561. Manu, according to the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 36) i. 5, 8. had ten wives; and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 37) ix. 1, 4, 6. explains polygamy by a characteristic legend. Moreover, the king regularly has four wives attributed to him, the Mahis2i1, 38) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 4, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 4; vi. 5, 3, 1; vii. 5, 1, 1; xiii. 2, 6, 4; 4, 1, 8; 5, 2, 2. 5. 9; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xix. 1, 4. Cf. Rv. v. 2, 2; 37, 3; Av. ii. 36, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 9, 1; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 220. the Parivr2kti1, 39) Pari-vr2kta1 occurs in Rv. x. 102, 11; Av. vii. 113, 2; xx. 128, 10. 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 6, 6; 4, 1, 8; 5, 2, 7; parivr2kti1 in Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 9, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7. 3, 4; iii. 9, 4, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 10; xv. 4; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 13. the Va1va1ta1, 40) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 22; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 3, 3; iii. 9, 4, 4; Av. xx. 128, 10. 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 6, 5; 4, 1, 8; 5, 2, 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 308, n.; Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 553, 554. and the Pa1la1gali1. 41) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 3, 3 et seq.; iii. 9, 4, 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 1, 8; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 4, 4. The Mahis2i1 appears to be the chief wife, being the first one married according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 42) vi. 5, 3, 1. The Parivr2kti1, ‘the neglected,’ is explained by Weber 43) Indische Studien, 10, 6. and Pischel 44) Vedische Studien, 2, 199. Cf. Geldner, ibid., 2, 38. as one that has had no son. The Va1va1ta1 is ‘the favourite,’ while the Pa1la1gali1 is, according to Weber, the daughter of the last of the court officials. The names are curious, and not very intelligible, but the evidence points to the wife first wedded alone being a wife in the fullest sense. This view is supported by the fact emphasized by Delbru7ck, 45) {|Indogermanische|} Verwandtschaftsnamen, 539. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 325. Ya1jn5avalkya had, however, two apparently equal wives (Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 1, and cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 10, 3). that in the sacrifice the Patni1 is usually mentioned in the singular, apparent exceptions being due to some mythological reason. 46) E.g., Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 6, 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 1. Zimmer 47) Altindisches Leben, 323. is of opinion that polygamy is dying out in the Rigvedic period, monogamy being developed from pologamy; Weber, 48) Indische Studien, 5, 222. Weber's theory that sapatna cannot be derived from sapatni1 is, however, quite untenable. however, thinks that polygamy is secondary, a view that is supported by more recent anthropology. 49) See, e.g., Westermaarck, Origin and Development of Marriage; Crawley, Mystic Rose. Polyandry.--On the other hand, polyandry is not Vedic. 50) Mayr, Indisches Erbrecht, Wien, 1873, contends in favour of its existence. But see Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 191, 207; 10, 83, 84; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 48; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 354 et seq.; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 431, n. 2; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 44, 340342; Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 541-545. There is no passage containing any clear reference to such a custom. The most that can be said is that in the Rigveda 51) x. 85, 37. 38. and the Atharvaveda 52) Av. xiv. 1, 44. 52. 61; 2, 14. 27. verses are occasionally found in which husbands are mentioned in relation to a single wife. It is difficult to be certain of the correct explanation of each separate instance of this mode of expression; but even if Weber's 53) Indische Studien, 5, 191. So Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 326, who, however, suggests that the plural is generic. view, that the plural is here used majestatis causa1, is not accepted, Delbru7ck's 54) Op. cit., 543. explanation by mythology is probably right. In other passages 55) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 2, 14. Cf. the plural s4vas4ura1h2, ‘fathers-in-law,’ in Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 12. The Niyoga has, of course, nothing to do with polyandry. the plural is simply generic. Marital Relations.--Despite polygamy, however, there is ample evidence that the marriage tie was not, as Weber 56) Indische Studien, 10, 83. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 573, and cf. Dharma. has suggested, lightly regarded as far as the fidelity of the wife was concerned. There is, however, little trace of the husband's being expected to be faithful as a matter of morality. Several passages, 57) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 8, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 7. indeed, forbid, with reference to ritual abstinence, intercourse with the stri1 of another. This may imply that adultery on the husband's part was otherwise regarded as venial. But as the word stri1 includes all the ‘womenfolk,’ daughters and slaves, as well as wife, the conclusion can hardly be drawn that intercourse with another man's ‘wife’ was normally regarded with indifference. 58) Cf. above, p. 396. The curious ritual of the Varun2apragha1sa1s, 59) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 2, 20; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 5, 2. in which the wife of the sacrificer is questioned as to her lovers, is shown by Delbru7ck 60) Op. cit., 550. to be a part of a rite meant to expiate unchastity on the part of a wife, not as a normal question for a sacrificer to put to his own wife. Again, Ya1jn5avalkya's doctrine in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 61) i. 3, 1, 21. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 76, n. 2; Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. parah2pum2sa1 (cf. above, p. 397). Delbru7ck, op. cit., 551, shows also that neither the Di1ks2a1 (‘consecration’) nor the Pravara (‘invitation’ to Agni, as described by the names of the mythical ancestors of the invoker) gives any countenance to the theory of doubt as to the parentage of the Vedic Indians. which seems to assert that no one cares if a wife is unchaste (parah2-pum2sa1) or not, really means that no one cares if the wife is away from the men who are sacrificing, as the wives of the gods are apart from them during the particular rite in question. Monogamy is also evidently approved, 62) Rv. i. 124, 7; iv. 3, 2; x. 71, 4, etc. so that some higher idea of morality was in course of formation. On the other hand, no Vedic text gives us the rule well known to other Indo-Germanic 63) Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 276 et seq. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 388, 389; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 366, 367. peoples that the adulterer taken in the act can be killed with impunity, though the later legal literature has traces of this rule. 64) Cf. above, p. 396. There is also abundant evidence that the standard of ordinary sexual morality was not high. Hetairai.--In the Rigveda 65) Rv. i. 134, 3; iii. 53, 8; viii. 17, 7. Maha1nagni1, Av. xiv. 1, 36; xx. 136, 5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 27, denotes a courtesan. Cf. Av. v. 7, 8. So also pum2s4cali1, Av. xv. 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 22; pum2s4calu1, Taittiri1ya1 Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 15, 1. there are many references to illegitimate love and to the abandonment of the offspring of such unions, 66) Rv. ii. 29, 1 (raha-su1h2, ‘one who bears in secret.’ Cf. Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 26; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 333, 334). especially in the case of a prote4ge4 of Indra, often mentioned as the para1vr2kta or para1vr2j. 67) Rv. ii. 13, 12; 15, 7; iv. 19, 9; 30, 16; Zimmer, op. cit., 335. The child, when exposed, was in danger of being consumed by ants (vamri1). Cf. below, p. 493. The ‘son of a maiden’ (kuma1ri1-putra) is already spoken of in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 68) xxx. 6. Such a person appears with a metronymic in the Upanis2ad period: 69) Cf. Ja1ba1la Satyaka1ma. this custom may be the origin of metronymics such as those which make up a great part of the lists of teachers (Vam2s4as) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 70) Cf. Pa1n2ini, iv. 1, 116. But the custom may be due simply to polygamy (Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, p. 244, n. 2). The Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 71) xxiii. 30. 31: Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 19, 2. 3. refers to illicit unions of S4u1dra and A1rya, both male and female, besides giving in its list of victims at the Purus2amedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ several whose designations apparently mean ‘courtesan’ (ati1tvari1) 72) xxx. 15. and ‘procuress of abortion’ (atis2kadvari1), 73) xxx. 15; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 11, 1, has apaskadvari1. while the ‘dyeing woman’ (rajayitri1) is dedicated to sensuality. 74) xxx. 12; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 7, 1. Pischel and Geldner also see many references to Hetairai in other passages of the Rigveda, 75) Cf. Vedische Studien, 1, xxv, 196, 275, 299, 309; 2, 120, 154, 179, etc.; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 48. especially where mention is made of Us2as, the goddess of Dawn, who in their view is the characteristic Hetaira. At any rate, there is little doubt that the ‘dancer’ (nr2tu1) referred to in one passage of the Rigveda 76) i. 92, 4. was a Hetaira. When women are referred to as going to the Samana, or ‘place of meeting,’ Hetairai are probably also meant. 77) Rv. iv. 58, 8; vi. 75, 4; x. 168, 2. Perhaps also vra1 in i. 124, 8; 126, 5. Grave cases of immorality are alluded to in the Rigveda. 78) x. 162, 5 (brother and sister: cf. above, p. 397). The love of father and daughter, as shown in the myth of Praja1pati, 79) Rv. x. 61, 5-7; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, viii. 2, 10; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 33; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 4, 1. is evidently censured, but the actual existence of this form of incest is recognized in the Atharvaveda. 80) viii. 6, 7. Girls who had lost their natural protectors--father or brother 81) Rv. i. 124, 7. Cf. Putrika1. --were apt to be reduced to live by immorality. Forms of Marriage.--The state of society revealed in the Vedic age seems to point to considerable freedom on the part of both man and woman in selecting a wife or a husband. At any rate, it is not clear that either the father or the mother controlled the marriage of son or daughter of mature age, 82) Cf. Delbru7ck, op. cit., 574. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 309, asserts that the consent of parent or brother was needed, but no clear evidence of this can be adduced. The later custom is not conclusive, since it is bound up with the usage of child marriage, which deprived both son and daughter of anyfree choice. Cf. ibid., 315; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, 15. though no doubt the parents or parent often arranged a suitable match. 83) This is so natural as not to need express evidence. Cf., e.g., the marriage proposals of S4ya1va1s4va A1treya, as detailed in the Br2haddevata1, v. 49 et seq.; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 51 et seq. The marriage was frequently arranged through an intermediary, the ‘wooer’ (vara), 84) Rv. x. 78, 4; 85, 15. 23. Zimmer, op. cit., 310, exalts this into a universal practice, and compares the use of aryaman, ‘friend,’ as ‘bride-wooer.’ In S4ya1va1s4va's case, his father acted for him. presumably after those concerned had in effect come to an agreement. The sale of a daughter was not unknown, 85) Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 11; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 4, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xx. vi. 5. See also Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra, iii. 53; viii. 204; ix. 98; Megasthenes in McCrindle's translation, p. 70; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 407; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 345 et seq.; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 381; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 78 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 86, n.; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 52. but a certain amount of discredit would seem to have attached to it, 86) Rv. i. 109, 2, refers to the gods Indra and Agni as more generous than a vija1ma1tr2, ‘son-in-law,’ or a sya1la, ‘brother-in-law.’ The force of vi in the former word must be unfavourable, and the sense, as indicated by Pischel, is no doubt, that a son-in-law who was not in other respects altogether suitable might have to buy his bride at a heavy cost. The vija1ma1tr2 is, in fact, the as4ri1ro ja1ma1ta1, the ‘ignoble son-in-law,’ of Rv. viii. 2, 20. Cf. Ya1ska, Nirukta, vi. 9; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 255. and sons-in-law in such cases were sometimes stingy. On the other hand, dowries were not infrequently given, especially no doubt when damsels Suffered from bodily defects. 87) Cf. Rv. vi. 28, 5; x. 27, 12; Av. v. 17, 12. Possibly in Rv. i. 109, 2, there is a reference to a generous brother giving his sister a dowry in order to get her a husband. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 345; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 459; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 352; Zimmer, op. cit., 310, n. It is doubtful whether anudeyi1 in Rv. x. 85, 6, means ‘dowry’ or not. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 741. Occasionally marriages by capture may have taken place, but only as knightly feats, as when Vimada carried off Purumitra's daughter against her father's wish, but very possibly with her own consent. 88) Cf. Rv. i. 112, 19; 116, 1; 117, 20; x. 39, 7; 65, 12. Sa1yan2a's view that Kamadyu1 was daughter of Purumitra seems certain, though Zimmer, loc. cit., is doubtful. The later law-books and the Epic describe in much detail various forms of marriage, but they all seem reducible to three types: (a) that which is based on mutual consent, the pra1ja1patya (‘connected with Praja1pati’); (b) that in which a price is paid for the bride, the a1sura (‘Asura-like’), a1rs2a (‘connected with the R2s2is’), bra1hma (‘relating to Brahman’), or daiva (‘divine’); (c) those which consist in stealing the bride, the ks2a1tra (‘warrior-like’) or the ra1ks2asa (‘demon-like’) mode, of all of which traces are found in Vedic literature. 89) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 361, 362; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 50 et seq.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 29; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 383. For instance, the gift of a maiden for services rendered or other object is exemplified in the story of Cyavana in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, 90) iii. 122. and in that of S4ya1va1s4va in the Br2haddevata1. 91) v. 49 et seq. Wedding Ceremony.--In normal marriages the bridal was celebrated by an elaborate ceremony which bears in essentials and details the strongest resemblance to the form observed by other Indo-Germanic as well as non-Indo-Germanic peoples, 92) The older ritual is described with considerable detail in Rv. x. 85 and Av. xiv. 1 and 2. The later ritual, as elaborately traced in the Gr2hya Su1tras, is set out by Weber and Haas, Indische Studien, 5, 177-411. See also Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 144 et seq.; von Schroeder, Die Hochzeitsgebra7uche der Esten, Berlin, 1888; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 384 et seq.; Hopkins, op. cit., 13, 355 et seq.; Winternitz, Das altindische Hochzeitsrituell, 1892; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 739 et seq.; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 389 et seq. and which was destined to secure the stability and fruitfulness of the union. The ceremony commenced at the bride's house, 93) x. 17, 1. to which the bridegroom with his friends and relations repaired, and in which he met the friends and relations of the bride. 94) Rv. iv. 58, 9; Av. vi. 60; xiv. 2, 59. A cow or cows were slain for the entertainment of the guests. 95) Rv. x. 85, 13. The bridegroom having caused the bride to mount a stone, formally grasped her hand, and led her round the household fire. 96) Cf. Rv. x. 85, 36. 38; Av. xiv. 1, 47. 48. Before the bride mounted the stone, the groom repeated, according to the Gr2hya Su1tras (A1s4vala1yana, i. 7. 3; S4a1n3kha1yana, i. 13, 4; Pa1raskara, i. 6, 3, etc.), the words, ‘I am he, thou art she; I the Sa1man, thou the R2c; I the heaven, thou the earth; here will we unite ourselves and produce offspring,’ for which see Av. xiv. 2, 71; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxv. 18; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 27; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 19 (Ma1dhyam2dina). This act constituted the marriage, the husband hence being called ‘he who takes by the hand’ (hasta-gra1bha). 97) x. 18, 8. Cf. Av. xiv. 1, 51. The festivities being over, 98) Av. xiv. 2, 59 et seq. the bridegroom took the bride to his home on a car in a marriage procession, 99) Rv. x. 85, 7. 8. 10. 24, 25. 26. 27. 42 et seq.; Av. xiv. 1, 60. all to the accompaniment of suitable stanzas. Then followed cohabitation. 100) See for the purification of the bride's garment, Rv. x. 85. 28-30. 35. Wife's Property and Status.--We have very little information as to the legal relations of wife and husband after marriage. It may be assumed that the husband appropriated the wife's dowry, if any, as well as her earnings, if any: even in the Epic 101) ‘They own neither themselves nor an inheritance’ (na1tmanas4 canes4ate na da1yasyed), says the Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 4, 2, 13. Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 8, 2; Nirukta, iii. 4. Cf. for the Epic, Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 368. For compulsory obedience of the wife, cf. Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 7. In the same Upani1s2ad Ya1jn5avalkya, on retiring from the ordinary life, divides his goods between his two wives. the rise of the recognition of women's property as their own (stri1-dhana) is only slow. That the husband was absolute master of a wife as of a slave is not probable, though he doubtless exercised the same power of correction as was expressly allowed in the eighteenth century by English law. The poetical ideal 102) Rv. viii. 31, 5-9; x. 34, 11; 85, 18. 19. 42 et seq.; Av. iii. 30; xiv. 2, 32. of the family was decidedly high, and we have no reason to doubt that it was often actually fulfilled. Moreover, the wife on her marriage was at once given an honoured position in the house; she is emphatically mistress in her husband's home, exercising authority over her fatherin-law, her husband's brothers, and her unmarried sisters. 103) Rv. x. 85, 46. Cf. as regards the bridegroom's sisters, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 37. In Av. xiv. 2, 26, the daughter-in-law is to be ‘wealful’ (s4ambhu1h2) to her father-in-law, and ‘pleasant’ (syona1) to her mother-in-law, which is correct on either theory of her position as a daughter or a mistress. No doubt the case contemplated is one in which the eldest son of a family has become its head owing to the decrepitude 104) Cf. Rv. i. 70, 5, where an old fath2er's goods are divided by his sons, and Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 327. Cf. also the possible case of a father who recovers after giving over all his goods to his son, Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 15. of the parents, his wife then taking the place of the mistress of the joint family while the brothers and sisters are still unmarried. It is not inconsistent with the great stress elsewhere 105) Av. viii. 6, 24; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 12 (Indische Studien, 5, 260); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 6, 12; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 22; Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 514, 515. laid on the respect due to a father-in-law, who then is probably regarded as still in full possession of his faculties, and controls the house while his son continues to live with him. The respect would no doubt equally apply if the son had set up a separate family of his own. 106) No doubt it might also apply even if the father-in-law were decrepit; but it is hardly likely that, in these circumstances, the strong sense of respect evident in Av. viii. 6, 24, which implies fear, would have developed. Moreover, the wife was a regular participator in the offerings of the husband. In this connexion the term Patni1 regularly applies to her in the Bra1hman2as, 107) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 9, 2, 14; Pa1n2ini, iv. 1, 33; Delbru7ck, op. cit., 510, 512. where Ja1ya1 designates her in her conjugal capacity, not in that of sharer in the sacrifice. In this respect her position gradually deteriorated: thus the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 108) i. 1, 4, 13. For the older practice, cf. Rv. i. 122, 2; iii. 53, 4-6; viii. 31, 5 et seq.; x. 86, 10, etc. describes a certain ceremony in which the wife (ja1ya1) alone offered the oblation in former times, while later a priest might do so instead. The same Bra1hman2a shows other traces of a lowering in the position of women, probably due to the growing sense of the importance of ceremonial priority. 109) E.g., i. 3, 1, 9. 12. 13. Cf. Le4vi, La doctrine du sacrifice, 157, 158. So in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 110) iii. 6, 3. women generally are classed with dice and drink as three chief evils, and woman is declared to be ‘untruth,’ 111) i. 10, 11. and connected with Nirr2ti, ‘calamity.’ 112) Ibid. A woman too, according to the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 113) vi. 5, 8, 2. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 1, 9. is inferior even to a bad man, and a sarcastic reference is made in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 114) xxxi. 1. Cf. Aitareva Bra1hmana, iii. 22. to her power of getting things from her husband by cajolery at night. On the other hand must be set the encomia on woman: a woman is half her husband, 115) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 1, 10. and completes him; 116) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 4, 17. and in the Rigveda 117) In viii. 33, 17, Indra is credited with a poor opinion of woman's intelligence, and Puru1ravas in x. 95, 15, frankly calls them hyenas. They are defended in v. 61, 6-8, but only against mean men (Pan2i). Cf. Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 351. attacks on women mingle with the general assumption of their good qualities. None the less, the Bra1hman2as clearly indicate a gradual decline in their position, which is evident from the rule that requires the wife to eat after her husband. 118) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 9, 2, 12; x. 5, 2, 9. Cf. Va1sis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, xii. 13; Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, i. 1, 2, 2; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 330, n.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 365, n. Scolds were also known: the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 119) iii. 24, 7. Cf. Gopatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 22; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 14, n. 2. praises the wife ‘who does not answer back’ (aprativa1dini1). Women bore no part in political life: men go to the assembly, not women, the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 120) iv. 7, 4. Cf. Av. vii. 38, 4. expressly says. On the other hand, with the advance of education, women shared in the intellectual interests of the day, as is exemplified by Ya1jn5avalkya's 121) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 4, 1; iv. 5, 1. two wives, of whom one was interested in his philosophical discussions, the other not. Other women are also referred to in the Upanis2ads as teachers, but whether they were married is not certain. 122) Cf. the epithet gandharva-gr2hita1, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 29; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, ii. 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 3, 1; 7, 1; and see A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra. iii. 4, 4; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 10. But the main object of a woman's marriage was the production of children, this being repeatedly asserted in the Rigveda and later. 123) Rv. i. 91, 20; 92, 13; iii. 1, 23; x. 85, 25. 41. 42. 45; Av. iii. 23, 2; v. 25, 11; vi. 11, 2, etc. The desire for offspring, as was natural in a society which mainly counted relationship through the father, took the form of a wish for a son to perform the necessary funeral rites for the father, and to continue his line. It was no doubt possible to adopt a son, but in the Rigveda 124) vii. 4, 7. 8. Cf. Nirukta, iii. 2. this custom is plainly viewed as unsatisfactory. The practice is recognized, 125) x. 18, 8; 40, 2. as we have seen above of Niyoga, in the appointment of a brother to beget children with the wife of a dead man, or perhaps of a man who is childless. ‘Sonlessness’ (avi1rata1) is placed on the same level as lack of property (amati), and Agni is besought to protect from it. 126) Rv. iii. 16, 5. The birth of a daughter was certainly not specially welcome: the Atharvaveda 127) vi. 11, 3. Cf. viii. 6, 25. in one hymn distinctly invokes the birth of a son, and deprecates that of a daughter, while the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 128) vii. 15. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 409. contains an old verse which says that a daughter is a misery (kr2pan2am), while a son is a light in the highest heaven (jyotir ha putrah2 parame vyoman). But there is no proof that the Vedic Indians practised the exposure of female children. This conclusion, deduced from certain passages in the later Sam2hita1s 129) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 10, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 4; 7, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvii. 9; Nirukta, iii. 4; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 17, 12. by Zimmer 130) Altindisches Leben, 319. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 314, n., who cites Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xi. 8, 8, as evidence of the exposure of two boys, but the sense is doubtful. and Delbru7ck, 131) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 575. See also Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 54, 210; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 6, 142; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 49; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 389, 390. Bo7htlingk's view is given in Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 44, 494-496, and cf. Pischel, Vedisehe Studien, 2, 48, who compares iv. 18, 5. has been disproved by Bo7htlingk. Child Life.--No doubt the care of a child was left to the mother, but we learn little from the earlier literature 132) The later literature is full of details of the ceremonies before and after birth (see Delbru7ck, op. cit., 573 et seq.). Weber, Naxatra, 2, 314, n., gives the Vedic embryology; twins were disliked, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 9, etc. of the life of the young. The length of the period of pregnancy is frequently placed at ten (doubtless lunar) months. 133) Rv. v. 78, 9; x. 184, 3; Av. i. 11, 6; iii. 23, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 13, 9; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 5. 2, 4; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 9. 1; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 314, n. There are in the Av. many spells concerned with birth (i. 11, etc.), and miscarriages are mentioned (avatoka1, avasu1, Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 15; Av. viii. 6, 9, etc.). On birth the child was first fed with milk or ghee, and then given the breast. 134) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 3, 4 (Ma1dhyam2dina = i. 5, 2 Ka1n2va). Cf. also vi. 4, 24 et seq.; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 1, 6. After being weaned the child is ati-stana (Kaus2itaki Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2). On the eighth day after birth the infant was washed. 135) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 7, 2 (on Sa1maveda, ii. 525 = Rv. ix. 96, 17). The first ten days were the dangerous period (Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 14; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxii. 14, 3). The cutting of the teeth was also a solemn occasion, 136) Av. vi. 140. and is the subject of a hymn in the Atharvaveda. Reference is also made to children's learning to speak, which the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 137) vi. 1, 6, 7. Cf. Satapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 4, 2, 38; xi. 1, 6, 3 5. ascribes to the end of the first year of life. The Aitareya A1ran2yaka 138) i. 3, 3. asserts that the words Tata and Ta1ta, onomatopoetic words like ‘dada,’ 139) Cf. Delbru7ck, op. cit., 449, 596. are the first words of a child's speech, giving therein perhaps an unfair prominence to the father. The Atharvaveda 140) vi. 68, Cf. ii. 13, according to Kaus4ika Su1tra, 53. 54, and cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 4, 1, 6. further contains at least one hymn for the ceremony of the first shaving of the young man's beard. The giving of a name was also an occasion of importance, a second one being often added. 141) Cf. Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 3, 3, with Keith's note; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 3, 9, and Na1man. Sati1.--On the death of her husband, in some cases the widow burned herself or was burned by his relations. 142) Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 391; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 41; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 67-69; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1896, 254 et seq.; Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 8, 468; Wilson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 16, 202; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 329; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 154. This is clearly implied in the reference to this ancient custom in the Atharvaveda. 143) Av. xviii. 3, 1. On the other hand, the Rigveda does not contemplate the custom anywhere, but on the contrary considers the widow as married apparently to the brother of the dead man. 144) x. 18, 7. 8. The custom of Suttee would therefore appear buring the Vedic age to have been in abeyance, at least as a general rule. At all times the practice seems to have been mainly usual among families of the warrior class, to judge from the other Indo-Germanic parallels. 145) Cf. Herodotos, v. 5 (of the Thracians); iv. 71 (of the Scythians); Procopius, De Bello Gothico, ii. 14 (of the Heruli). So in Germany Brynhild and Nanna are instances (cf. Weinhold, Altnordisches Leben, 476 et seq.). The universality of the custom must not be exaggerated, as Zimmer, 331, is inclined to do. To burn all the wives of a king would, in primitive ages, have been a wasteful action; even the chief wife would often have had to be spared on one ground or another. The Rigveda already reveals a state of society in which the actual burning of the wife was avoided by a semblance of it in the funeral ritual of (cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 126). The reward of a good wife was to go to the world of her husband (pati-loka) after death (cf. Av. xiv. 1, 64; xviii. 3, 1; Rv. x. 85, 43). A Vedic citation in the scholiast on Pa1n2ini, iii. 2, 8, Va1rttika, 2, says that a Brahmin woman who drinks Sura1, an intoxicating liquor, does not go to the world of her husband after death. In other classes the survival of wives was more necessary, and the remarriage of widows, whether prohibited or allowed in the texts, is proof that there were widows who could be remarried. 146) Cf. perhaps the garta1ruh of Rv. i. 124, 7, as explained by Ya1ska, Nirukta, iii. 5; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 22.

पत्ति
पत्ति
 is used in the Atharvaveda (vii. 62, 1) to designate the ‘foot soldier’ in war as opposed to the Rathin, ‘charioteer,’ the latter defeating (ji) the former. One of the epithets of Rudra in the S4atarudriya liturgy of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (xvi. 19) is ‘lord of footmen’ (patti1na1m2 pati).

पत्नी
पत्नी
 See Pati. A part of the house is the Patni1na1m2 Sadana, mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 3, 7. presumably the women's quarters. The phrase is borrowed from the Patni1s4a1la, ‘hut for the wife,’ of the Bra1hman2a 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 18; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 6, 9, 8; x. 2, 3, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 22 (-s4a1la1); Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xix. 6, etc. ritual.

पथिन्सौभर
पथिन् सौभर
 (‘descendant of Sobhari’) is mentioned in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) ii. 5, 22 (Ma1dhyam2dina = ii. 6, 3 Ka1n2va); iv. 5, 28 (Ma1dhyam2dina = iv. 6, 3 Ka1n2va). as the pupil of Aya1sya A1n3girasa.

पथिकृत्
पथि-कृत्,
 ‘path-maker,’ is not a rare epithet in the Rigveda 1) ii. 23, 6; vi. 21, 12; ix. 106, 5; x. 14, 15; 111, 3, etc. and later, 2) Av. xviii. 2, 53; 3, 25, etc. showing clearly the importance naturally attached in primitive times to the finding of roads. The frequency with which the epithet is applied to Agni 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 1, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 1, 5, 5; xii. 4, 4, 1; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, etc. suggests that there is here an allusion to fire burning the primæval forest and rendering advance possible. The god Pu1s2an is pathi-kr2t, as guarding the flocks. 4) Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, iii. 4, 9; xvi. 1, 17. The Su1tra, xvi. 1, 18, explains pathi-kr2t merely as adhipati, ‘lord’; but the sense must be more pregnant than that. The R2s2is, 5) Rv. x. 14, 15, where the expression refers to their finding the way to the heavenly world; but it is probably a transfer of an epithet of terrestrial application. or seers, as ‘path-makers,’ may be compared with the Roman Pontifices.

पद्
पद्
 in the Atharvaveda (xix. 6, 2) and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xi. 3, 2, 3) denotes a ‘quarter.’ This sense is derived from the primary meaning of ‘foot,’ which as applied to quadrupeds would represent ‘one-fourth.’ Cf. Pa1da.

पद
पद
 in the sense of ‘quarter of a stanza’ is found as early as the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 24. 45. and often later. 2) Av. ix. 10, 19; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 25; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 6. 10. 17, etc.; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxii. 1. 5. In the Bra1hman2as it also denotes a ‘word’ as opposed to a ‘letter’ (Varn2a). 3) Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxvi. 5, where the sequence is half-stanza (ardharca), quarter-stanza (pa1da), word (pada), and letter (varn2a). Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 2, 6, 13; xi. 5, 6, 9, etc.

पदि
पदि
 is found once in the Rigveda, 1) i. 125, 2. where, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the word probably designates some kind of animal. Ya1ska 2) Nirukta, v. 18. explains it as equivalent to gantu, ‘a moving creature,’ but Durga 3) In his commentary on Nirukta, loc. cit. as meaning ‘bird.’ The passage may refer to catching the Padi in a net (? muks2i1ja1). 4) Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 129; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 244.

In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) xiii. 5, 4, 4. he is styled Hairan2yana1bha, ‘descendant of Hiran2yana1bha,’ and in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 4) xvi. 9, 11. he is called Para A1hla1ra Vaideha, a fact testifying to the close connexion of Kosala and Videha.

 ‘of supreme power,’ is understood by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. in one passage of the Rigveda 2) viii. 1, 30. as the proper name of a great man among the Yadus. But it is doubtful whether the word is more than an epithet. 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 39.

 denotes a large wild animal which Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. conjectures to be the wild ass. It is mentioned in the Vr2s2a1kapi hymn 2) x. 86, 18. of the Rigveda, twice in the Atharvaveda, 3) vi. 72, 2; xx. 131, 22. and in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 4) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 8; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 21, 1, where the commentator takes it to be the wild buffalo. in all of which passages the sense of ‘wild ass’ is satisfactory. More doubtful is the meaning of the word paras4va1(n) in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, 5) i. 2. where the commentary explains it as ‘serpent.’ It is, of course, quite possible that the word has nothing to do with parasvant. Bu7hler 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 63; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 17, n. 1; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 377, n. 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 633; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86, 87; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 335; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 105. suggests connexion with the Pa1li pala1sa1da, ‘rhinoceros.’

 is a term found in four passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 8; ii. 13, 12; 15, 7; x. 61, 8. in all of which it refers to a person in a forlorn condition, while one 2) x. 61, 8. of them also speaks of him as going south. Sa1yan2a's 3) On i. 112, 8, etc., of. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 152. view that the word is a proper name is most unlikely, while Grassmann's 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 1, 23, and cf. Wo7rterbuch, s.v. explanation of it as ‘cripple’ is still less probable. Roth's 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. interpretation of it as ‘exile’ seems clearly right in the passage which refers to the Para1vr2j as going south. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 185, 334, 335. accepts Roth's view for this passage, but in the others sees a reference to the child of a maiden exposed by her and in danger of being eaten by insects (vamri1). This view is supported by the fact that para1vr2kta seems to have the same sense, 7) Rv. iv. 30, 19. Cf. iv. 30, 16; 19, 9. and is accepted by Oldenberg. 8) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 200.

 is mentioned with S4ataya1tu and Vasis2t2ha in the Rigvedic hymn celebrating Suda1s' 1) vii. 18, 21. victory over the ten kings. According to the Nirukta 2) vi. 30. he was a son of Vasis2t2ha, but the Epic version makes him a son of S4akti and grandson of Vasis2t2ha. Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 132. thinks that he is mentioned in the Rigveda along with S4ataya1tu, perhaps his uncle, and his grandfather Vasis2t2ha, as the three sages who approached Indra and won his favour for Suda1s. He is erroneously credited with the authorship of certain hymns of the Rigveda 4) i. 65-73. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110, 111; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 324. The Para1s4aras as a school appear in the Ka1t2haka Anukraman2i1 (Indische Studien, 3, 460). by the Anukraman2i1 (Index).

 appears in the Atharvaveda 1) xx. 127, 7-10. See also Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Veda, 156, 157, and the verses in the Vaita1na Su1tra, xxxiv. 9. The Vedic spelling is Pariks2it, not Pari1ks2it. as a king in whose realm, that of the Kurus, prosperity and peace abound. The verses in which he is celebrated are later 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 32, 10; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 5; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 12; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 17. called Pa1riks2ityah2, and the Bra1hman2as explain that Agni is pari-ks2it because he dwells among men. Hence Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Bloomfield 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 690, 691. but see Atharvaveda, 101, n. 9. regard Pariks2it in the Atharvaveda not as a human king at all. This may be correct, but it is not certain. Both Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 131. and Oldenberg 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 237; Buddha, 396. recognize Pariks2it as a real king, a view supported by the fact that in the later Vedic literature King Janamejaya bears the patronymic Pa1riks2ita. If this be so, Pariks2it belonged to the later period, since the Atharvan passage in which his name occurs is certainly late, and none of the other Sam2hita1s know Pariks2it at all. The Epic 7) See Zimmer, loc. cit. makes him grandfather of Pratis4ravas and great-grandfather of Prati1pa, and Zimmer, 5) Altindisches Leben, 131. probably with justice, compares the Pra1tisutvana and Prati1pa found in another late Atharvan passage. 8) xx. 129. But Deva1pi and S4antanu cannot be brought into connexion with Prati1pa. 9) Deva1pi is really a Brahmin, son of R2s2t2is2en2a, and not connected directly with S4antanu. Ya1ska, Nirukta, ii. 10, identifies them as brothers and Kurus; but the former part of the identification is, no doubt, wrong.

Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 136, 137; Foy, Die ko1nigliche Gewalt, 16-19; 3337; 66; Bu7hler, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 55, 56; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 124.

 is the name of a drink which is mentioned first in the Atharvaveda, 1) iii. 12, 7; xx. 127, 9. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 68. and which was distinct from both Sura1 and Soma, 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 2, 14. Cf. v. 5, 4, 10; xi. 5, 5, 13; xii. 7, 1, 7; 8, 2, 15; 9, 1, 1. but was intoxicating. According to Mahi1dhara, 3) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 34. the liquor was made from flowers (Pus2pa). Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 281, 282. thinks that it was the family drink, and this is supported by the fact that in the Atharvaveda it twice occurs as a household beverage. 5) See also Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 15; xx. 59; xxi. 29; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 2. Its nature is more elaborately explained in the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiv. 1, 14; xv. 10, 11; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 349, 350. Hillebrandt 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 24, 8. is of opinion that it was very much the same as Sura1.

परुच्छेप
परुच्-छेप
 is the name of a R2s2i to whom the Anukraman2i1 (Index) attributes a series of hymns 1) Rv. i. 127-139. in the Rigveda, and whose authorship is asserted in the Aitareya 2) v. 12. 13 (where hymns Rv. i. 128, 129, 130, 133, 135, 137, 139, are attributed to him). and the Kaus2i1taki 3) xxiii. 4. 5.

Parucchepa's claim to authorship is very doubtful. he appears as a rival of Nr2medhas.

परुष
परुष
 seems to mean ‘reed’ in the Atharvaveda (viii. 8, 4) and ‘arrow’ in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xiv. 22, 20).

परुष्णी
परुष्णी
 is the name of a river which is mentioned in the Nadi1-stuti (‘Praise of Rivers’), 1) x. 75, 5. and in the song of Suda1s’ victory over the ten kings, 2) vii. 18, 8. 9. which seems to have been made decisive by the rise of the river drowning the fugitives. 3) It is impossible to decide precisely what part the river played in the battle. It is usually held that the enemies of Suda1s tried to divert the stream, but failed, and were drowned in its current. So Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 11; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 154; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 103, holds that Suda1s was caught between two opposing armies, and had to escape over the Parus2n2i1, that his enemies tried to divert it to render him more accessible to their attack, but failed, and were overwhelmed in the river. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 52 et seq., may be right in rejecting in toto the theory of the attempted diversion of the waters, though in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261 et seq., he accepted the traditional view. In these passages and one of the eighth book of the Rigveda, 4) viii. 74, 15. where it is called a ‘great stream’ (mahenadi), the name is certainly that of the river later called Ravi (Ira1vati1), as recognized by Ya1ska. 5) Nirukta, ix. 26. Pischel 6) Vedische Studien, 2, 208-210. sees a reference to it in two other passages of the Rigveda, 7) iv. 22, 2; v. 52, 9. where ‘wool’ (u1r2n2a1) is connected with the word parus2n2i1, and the allusion to the river is accepted by Max Mu7ller 8) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 315, 323. and Oldenberg, 9) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 348. though they are not fully agreed as to the exact sense of the passages in question. Pischel suggests that the name is derived from the ‘flocks’ (parus) of wool, not from the bends of the river, as understood by the Nirukta, 5) Nirukta, ix. 26. or from its reeds, as Roth 10) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4a. suggests. The mention of the Parus2n2i1 and the Yamuna1 in the hymn celebrating the victory of Suda1s has given rise to the conjectures of Hopkins, 11) Op. cit., 52. that the Yamuna1 in that hymn is merely another name for the Parus2n2i1, and of Geldner, 12) R2gveda, Glossar, 106. that the Parus2n2i1 there is merely a tributary of the Yamuna1 (Jumna). But neither interpretation is either essential or even probable. The hymn is a condensed one, and may well be taken as celebrating two great victories of Suda1s. There is a doubtful reference to the Parus2n2i1 in the Atharvaveda. 13) vi. 12, 3. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 462; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 289.

परुस्

2. Parn2a denotes the tree Butea frondosa, later usually called Pala1s4a. It occurs in the Rigveda 1) x. 97, 5. in connexion with the As4vattha, and with that tree as well as the Nyagrodha in the Atharvaveda, 2) v. 5, 5. which mentions both amulets 3) iii. 5, 4. 8. and the cover of sacrificial dishes 4) xviii. 4, 53. as made from its wood.

Cf. viii. 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 3, 11; 7, 1, 9; 8, 7. is mentioned. The Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 8) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, loc. cit., and cf.

The tree is also often mentioned elsewhere. 9) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 10; vi. 5, 1, 1; xi. 1, 4, 2; 7, 28; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 5, 4.

 is the name of a man included in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xxx. 16. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 2) iii. 4, 12, 1. According to Mahi1dhara, 3) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. a Bhilla is meant--i.e., presumably a wild hillman, for he glosses Nis2a1da in the same way. 4) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 27. Sa1yan2a 5) On Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. explains the word as meaning ‘one who catches fish by putting over the water a parn2a with poison,’ but this is apparently a mere etymological guess. Weber's 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndiscnen Gesellschaft, 18, 281. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 119. rendering of the term as referring to a savage ‘wearing feathers’ is ingenious, but uncertain.

पर्यङ्क

 is the name of the seat of the Brahman in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad. 1) i. 5. It seems to correspond to what is elsewhere called A1sandi; 2) Av. xv. 3, 3. Cf. xiv. 2, 65; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 5, 6, 12. as used in the Upanis2ad, it can, however, hardly mean a long seat for reclining on, but rather a throne. 3) Cf.

1. Parvata in the Rigveda 1) i. 37, 7; v. 56, 4. and the Atharvaveda 2) Av. iv. 6, 8; vi. 12, 3; 17, 3; ix. 1, 18; xii. 1, 11. is conjoined with giri in the sense of ‘hill’ or ‘mountain.’ From the Rigveda 3) i. 39, 5; 52, 2; 155; 1; 191, 9; ii. 12, 2, 3; 17, 5, etc. onwards 4) Av. i. 14, 1; iii. 21, 10; iv. 9, 8; viii. 7, 17; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 5, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 1; xviii. 13, etc. it is common in this sense as connected with the waters of rivers which flow in the hills. 5) Rv. vii. 34, 23; 35, 8; viii. 18, 16; 31, 10; x. 35, 2; 36, 1, etc.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, i. 80; 2, 66. The legend of the mountains having wings is already found in the Sam2hita1s. 6) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvi. 9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 13; and Rv. iv. 54, 5, as explained by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 174. In the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 7) ii. 13; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 407; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 28, n. 1. are mentioned the southern (daks2in2a) and the northern (uttara) mountains, evidently in allusion to the Hima1laya and the Vindhya ranges. The plants (os2adhi) and aromatic products (an5jana) of the mountains are referred to in the Atharvaveda, 8) xix. 44, 6; 45. 7. and their mineral treasures in the Rigveda. 9) x. 69, 6.

पर्वत
2. Parvata in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vii. 87, 8 denotes, according to Ludwing, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. a sacrificer whose generosity is praised. But it is probable that the god Parvata, the spirit of the mountain, is meant. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

पर्वत
3. Parvata is mentioned several times in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 13, 34; viii. 21; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 17. 4. along with Na1rada. The Anukraman2i1 (Index) attributes to him the authorship of several hymns of the Rigveda. 2) viii. 12, ix, 104; 105.

पर्वन्
पर्वन्
 denotes the knots of the reed or the joints of a plant, 1) Av. xii. 3, 31; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i, 1, 2, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 3, 1, 31, and cf. Rv. x. 68, 9. and more generally a part or limb of the body. 2) Rv. i. 61, 12; iv. 19, 9; viii. 48, 5; x. 89, 8; Av. i. 11, 1; 12, 2; ii. 9, 1; vi. 14, 1; xi. 8, 12; xii. 5, 71; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 31; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 35 et seq.; iii. 4, 4, 2; vi. 1, 2, 31; x. 4, 5, 2, etc. It also designates a period of time, probably with reference to the breaks in the month at new and full moon. 3) Rv. i. 94, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 43; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 35; vi. 2, 2, 34, etc. Cf. Ma1sa. In the Su1tras the days of the four-monthly festivals (ca1turma1saya) are so called: Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, v. 2, 13; xxii. 7, 1. 16. 17; xxiv. 4, 30; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiv. 5, 6; 10, 4. 18; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 2, 3; and more often the periods of the change of moon: Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra. xxiv. 6, 4. 25. 30; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 2, 1; 3, 1; La1t2ya1yana Srauta Su1tra, viii. 8, 46, etc. In one passage 4) vii. 103, 5. Geldner 5) R2gveda, Glossar, 107. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 364, who quotes Tacitus, Germania, 11. thinks the word indicates a song section of the Sa1maveda.

पर्शान
पर्शान,
 ‘hollow,’ is mentioned several times in the Rigveda (vii. 104, 5; viii. 7, 34; 45, 41).

पर्शु
1. Pars4u denotes ‘rib’ in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 7, 6; x. 9, 20; xi. 3, 12. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 25, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxi. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 6, 2, 10; x. 6, 4, 1; xii. 3, 1, 6; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, i. 3, etc. Cf. S4ari1ra.

पर्शु
2. Pars4u seems in some passages 1) Av. xii. 3, 31 (Kaus4ika Su1tra, i. 24. 25; viii. 11; lxi. 38. 39); perhaps vii. 28, 1 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 4, 1. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 407, 408; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 26 (where pars4u is metrically needed), etc. Cf. Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. to denote a ‘sickle,’ being apparently a variant of Paras4u. 

पर्शु
3. Pars4u in the Nirukta 1) iv. 6. is explained in one passage of the Rigveda 2) i. 105, 8; x. 33, 2. as meaning the sides of a cistern (ku1pa). 3) Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 100; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 107. But the sense of ‘ribs’ is quite adequate there.

पर्शु
4. Pars4u occurs in one passage in a Da1nastuti (‘praise of gifts’) in the Rigveda 1) viii. 6, 46. as the name of a man. It is not certain that he is identical with Tirindira, but the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xvi. 11, 20. mentions Tirindira Pa1ras4avya as the patron of Vatsa Ka1n2va. In another passage occurring in the Vr2s2a1kapi hymn, 3) x. 86, 23. Apparently Va1rttika 2, on Pa1n2ini, iv. 1, 177, where Pars4u is explained as a feminine, Princess of the Pars4us, refers to this passage. On the sense, cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 42; Rigveda, Glossar, 107; and Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 2, 2, where the expression occurs, but where the sense is very dubious. Pars4u Ma1navi1 occurs, apparently as a woman, daughter of Manu, but who is meant it is quite impossible to say. Excepting these two, there are no other occurrences in which the word has with any probability the value of a proper name in the Rigveda. Ludwig, 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 196 et seq. however, sees in several other places an allusion to the Pars4us. Thus in one passage of the Rigveda 5) x. 33, 2. The sense here is, no doubt, ‘ribs.’ See Geldner, op. cit., 2, 184, n. 3; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 362, n. he finds a reference to the defeat of Kurus4ravan2a by the Pars4us; in another 6) vii. 83, 1, pr2thu-pars4avah2, which really means either ‘with large ribs’-i.e., ‘strong,’ as Roth, with Sa1yan2a, inclines to take it--or ‘with broad axes,’ according to Zimmer. he finds a reference to the Pr2thus and Pars4us--i.e., the Parthians and the Persians. He also sees the Parthians in Pa1rthava, a name found in one hymn. 7) vi. 27, 8. The same view is taken by Weber, 8) Indische Studien, 4, 379; Indian Literature, 4; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 36 et seq. He confines his view to the equation of Pars4u in Rigveda, viii. 6, 46, and the Persians. Hillebrandt, who is inclined to see relations with Iran in early times (see Pan2i, Pa1ra1vata, Sr2n5jaya), does not in this connexion quote Pars4u at all, and, though he mentions Pa1rthava, does not regard it as probably referring to a Parthian (Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105). Brunnhofer, in his various works (Iran und Turan, 1889; vom Pontus bis zum Indus, 1890, etc.), finds constant references in the Veda to events in Iran, but his theories must be regarded as definitely unscientific. See also Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 264, n. who holds that historical connexions with the Persians are referred to. But Zimmer 9) Altindisches Leben, 134 et seq.; 433. Ibid., 434, 435, he refutes conclusively Ludwig's extraordinary view that Pr2thu and Pars4u are dialectical forms of the same word. points out that this conclusion is not justified; the Pars4us were known to Pa1n2ini 10) v. 3, 117. as a warrior tribe; the Pa1ras4avas were a tribe in south-west Madhyades4a; and the Periplus 11) c. 38. knows a tribe of Parthoi in north India. At most the only conclusion to be drawn is that the Indians and Iranians were early connected, as was of course the case. Actual historical contact cannot be asserted with any degree of probability.

पर्ष
पर्ष
 occurs in the Rigveda, 1) x. 48, 7; Nirukta, iii. 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. Perhaps pars2in, in the compound is2u-pars2in in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 2, 5, means ‘having a bundle (of arrows).’ denoting in the plural ‘sheaves’ strewn over the threshing floor. Cf. Khala.

पलद
पलद
 occurs twice in one hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 3, 5, 17. Cf. Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 153; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 194, 195. in the description of a house. It seems to mean bundles of straw or reeds used to thatch the house and render the sides wind and weather proof.

पलस्ति
पलस्ति
 See Palita.

पलाल
पलाल
 is found with Anu-pala1la in the Atharvaveda (viii. 6, 2) as the name of a demon. The meaning of the word is ‘straw,’ in which sense it occurs in the Kaus4ika Su1tra (lxxx. 27), while the feminine form, Pala1li1, is found in the Atharvaveda itself (ii. 8, 3) as the straw of barley (Yava).

पलाव
पलाव
 is found in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 3, 19, where some manuscripts read pala1va1. and the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 2) i. 54, 1 in the sense of ‘chaff.’ 

पलाश
पलाश,
 like Parn2a, denotes ‘leaf’ in the Bra1hman2as. 1) Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, x. 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 4, 5; v. 2, 1, 17 etc.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 14, 3. It also 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 3, 19; ii. 6, 2, 8, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59. designates the tree Butea frondosa, of which Parn2a is the early name.

पलित
पलित,
 ‘grey-haired,’ occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) i. 144, 4; 164, 1; iii. 55, 9; x. 4, 5, etc. onwards. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 15, etc. It is the distinctive sign of old age. Those who, like certain descendants of Jamadagni, do not grow old, 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 9, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxi. 10, 6. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54, and Rv. iii. 53, 16, where palasti seems to mean palita. are said not to become grey-haired, while Bharadva1ja is described as having in his old age become thin and grey-haired. 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 49. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 5) xi. 4, 1, 6. 14. in one passage observes that grey hairs appear first on the head, and elsewhere 6) iii. 8, 2, 25. alludes to the hair on the arms having become grey.

पल्पूलन
पल्पूलन
 is found in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 4, 9. Cf. Kaus4ika Su1tra, xi. 16. and the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 2) ii. 5, 5, 6. apparently meaning, properly, ‘lye,’ or water impregnated with some biting substance for washing clothes. In the Atharvan passage urine seems to be meant. 3) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 695. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 74, 175. The verb palpu1laya, ‘to wash with alkaline water,’ occurs in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 2) ii. 5, 5, 6. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a; 4) i. 3, 5, 2. 3. and the Su1tras refer to hides (carman) 5) Kaus4ika Su1tra, 67. and garments 6) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 8, 12. Cf. Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra. i. 6, 13, 15; Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. so washed. Cf. also Va1sah2palpu1li1.

पल्लिगुप्तलौहित्य
पल्लि-गुप्त लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in a Vam2s4a (‘list of teachers’) in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of S4ya1majayanta Lauhitya. The name is obviously a late one, for Palli is not found in the early literature, and the name of the Lauhitya family is otherwise known in post-Vedic works only.

पवन
पवन
 (‘purifier’) in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 34, 2; xviii. 3, 11. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 9. denotes an instrument for purifying grain from husks, etc.; either a ‘sieve’ or a ‘winnowing basket’ may be meant. In the Su1tras 2) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 5, 7. it is mentioned as used for cleaning the bones of the dead after cremation.

पवमान
पवमान
 is a term very frequently applied in the Rigveda to the Soma ‘purifying itself’ by running through the sieve. Later it appears in a few passages 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 20, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vi. 17; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 7. in the sense of ‘wind’ (as a purifier).

पवस्त
पवस्त
 in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 5, 6. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda. 156. apparently denotes ‘covers.’

पवि
पवि
 denotes the ‘tire’ of the wheel of a chariot in the Rigveda 1) i. 34, 2; 88, 2; 139, 3; 166, 10, etc.; Nirukta, v. 5. and later. 2) Sa1maveda, ii. 7, 1, 15, 3, etc. Reference is made 3) Rv. vi. 54, 3. to the necessity for fastening it on firmly, and the epithet su-pavi, ‘having a good tire,’ is found in the Atharvaveda 4) Av. iv. 12, 6. with su-na1bhi, ‘having a good nave,’ and su-cakra, ‘having a good wheel.’ The tires were, of course, of metal, 5) Of gold in the case of the As4vins and the Maruts, Rv. i. 64, 11; 180, 1. and being sharp, 6) Rv. i. 166, 10. could serve on occasion as weapons. 7) Rv. v. 52, 9. Cf. vi. 8, 5, and x 180, 2. The St. Petersburg Dictionary in one passage of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 8) vi. 30. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 4, 5. Mahi1dhara, on the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, takes pavina1 as vajrasadr2s4ena, ‘like a thunderbolt,’ and Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 239, 240, renders pavi by ‘bolt.’ takes Pavi to mean a metal rim on the stone for pounding Soma, but this seems improbable, because no such metal attachment is elsewhere alluded to. Hillebrandt 9) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 44. seems clearly right in accepting the sense of ‘sharp edge’ in this passage, especially as the stones in the Rigveda 10) v. 31. 5. are, in allusion to their rolling action, styled ‘rims without horses and without chariots’ (anas4va1sah2 pavayo 'ratha1h2). The Nirukta 11) xii. 30. ascribes to Pavi the sense of arrow (s4alya), but this is very uncertain. The St. Petersburg Dictionary cites for this use two passages of the Rigveda, 12) ix. 50, 1; x. 180, 2. but in one the secondary sense of sharp-edged weapon with reference to the bolt of Indra is quite likely, and in the other, where the expression va1n2asya pavi occurs, the sharp-edged pounding-stone of the ‘reed,’ 13) Cf. Rv. iv. 24, 9, where the expression va1n2am2 duhanti, ‘they milk out the reed,’ occurs. meaning the stalk of the Soma plant, may be meant. Hillebrandt 14) Op. cit., 1, 43, 44. thinks a reference to the shape of the Soma plant is intended. Pavi1-nasa, the name of a demon mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 15) viii. 6, 21. seems to throw no light on this point, for while the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean ‘whose nose is like a spearhead,’ it is translated as ‘rim-nosed’ (presumably in allusion to the curved shape of the nose) by Whitney. 16) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 497. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 12, n. 1.

पवित्र
पवित्र
 denotes in the Rigveda, 1) i. 28, 9; iii. 36, 7; viii. 33, 1; 101, 9, etc. and later, 2) Av. vi. 124, 3; ix. 6, 16; xii. 1, 30; 3, 3. 14. 25, etc. the sieve used for purifying the Soma, the only mode of purifying it certainly 3) Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 239, 240. known to the Rigveda. It seems clearly 4) Cf. the names of it: an2va, Rv. ix. 16, 2; an2va1ni mes2yah2, 86, 47; 107, 11; avayah2, ii. 36, 1; ix. 86, 11; 91, 2; tvac with avya or avyaya, ix. 69, 3; 70, 7; mes2yah2, ix. 8, 5; ru1pa avyaya, ix. 16, 6; roman, alone or with avyaya; va1ra, alone or with avyaya, etc. to have been made of sheep's wool, whether woven or plaited is not certain, for the expressions used are too vague to be decisive, though Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 278, n. thinks hvara1m2si 6) ix. 3, 2; 63, 4. points to plaiting.

पवीर
पवीर,
 according to the Nirukta, 1) xii. 30, In Rv. i. 174, 4, pavi1rava seems to mean ‘thunderbolt.’ denotes a ‘lance.’ The epithet derived from this word, pavi1ravant or pavi1rava, which is found in the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 17, 3. and the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 3) Pavi1ravant, Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 71; pavi1rava, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 10, 2, 5, 6; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 12; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 11. is used of the plough, apparently in the sense of ‘having a metal share.’ The same epithet occurs in the Rigveda 4) x. 60, 3. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 116. applied to a man, in the sense of ‘having a goad’ or ‘having a spear.’

पवीरु
पवीरु
 appears in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 51, 9 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxiii. 82. as a Rus4ama, being a prince or at least a wealthy noble.

पशु
पशु
 means ‘animal’ generally, including man. There is frequent mention 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 10, 1-4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 17; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 17; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 47-51, Cf. Av. xi. 2, 9; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 10, 1-3; v. 5, 1, 1. 2; vi. 5, 10, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 28-31, etc. of the five sacrificial animals--the horse, the cow, the sheep, the goat, and man. Seven such domestic animals are spoken of in the Atharvaveda 2) Av. iii. 10, 6. and later; 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 8, 4, 16; ix. 3, 1, 20; xii. 8, 3, 13 (where they are called ja1gata1h2, perhaps as numbering 12); Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, x. 2, 7. probably, as Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 103. observes, merely as a sacred mystic number, not, as the commentator 5) On Av. iii. 10, 6. The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests ‘mule’ and ‘ass’ as the two making up seven (cf. Maha1bha1rata, vi. 165 et seq.). Zimmer's view (Altindisches Leben, 76) is that ‘goat,’ ‘sheep,’ ‘ox,’ ‘horse,’ ‘dog,’ ‘ass,’ and ‘camel’ or ‘mule,’ are meant. explains, the usual five with the ass and the camel added. Animals are also referred to as ubhayadant and anyatodant. They are further 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 5, 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 7 (where purus2a must be read for parus2a). classified as those which take hold with the hand (hasta1da1na1h2), man (purus2a), elephant (hastin), and ape (markat2a), and those which grasp by the mouth (mukha1da1na1h2). Another division is that of biped (dvipa1d) and quadruped (catus2pa1d). 7) Rv. iii. 62, 14; Av. iii. 34, 1, etc. Zimmer, 73, n., suggests that the division is Indo-European, as the Inguvenic tables make a distinction between dupursus and peturpursus. Man is a biped; 8) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 10, 1, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 47, 48. he is the first (prathama) of the beasts; 9) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 1, 18; vii. 5, 2, 6. he alone of animals lives a hundred years (s4ata1yus), 10) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 6, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 2, 5, 17. and he is king of the animals. 11) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xx. 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 5, 7. Cf. Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 18, 274. He possesses speech (va1c) in conjunction with the other animals. 12) Rv. viii. 100, 11. In the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 13) ii. 3, 2, with Keith's note. an elaborate distinction is drawn between vegetables, animals, and man in point of intellect. Of animals apart from man a threefold division is offered in the Rigveda 14) x. 90, 8. --into those of the air (va1yavya), those of the jungle (a1ran2ya), and those of the village (gra1mya), or tame animals. The division into a1ran2ya and gra1mya animals is quite common. 15) Av. iii. 31, 3. Cf. ii. 34, 1, with Whitney's note, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 78; xi. 2, 24; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 3; 9, 7; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 12; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 29. 32; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 1, 8; 2, 8. Cf. xi. 8, 3, 2, where there is reference to animals being tied up at night in their stalls. In the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 16) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv, 3, 10, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 30. is found a division into eka-s4apha, ‘whole-hoofed’; ks2udra, ‘small’; and a1ran2ya, ‘wild,’ the two former classes denoting the tame animals. 16) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 10, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 30. The horse and the ass are eka-s4apha; 17) Zimmer, 74. the ks2udra are the sheep, the goat, and the ox: this distinction being parallel to that of ubhayadant and anyatodant. 18) Cf. Av. v. 31, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 6, 3, with Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 1, 5: v. 1, 1, 3; 2, 6. Zimmer 19) Op. cit., 77, 78. sees in a passage of the Atharvaveda 20) xi, 2, 24. 25, compared with xii. 1, 40, 51. a division of wild animals (a1ran2ya) into five classes: (1) those of the jungle described as the ‘dread beasts which are in the wood’ (mr2ga1 bhi1ma1 vane hita1h2); (2) winged creatures, represented by the Ham2sa, ‘gander,’ Suparn2a, ‘eagle,’ S4akuna, ‘bird’; (3) amphibia--S4im2s4uma1ra, ‘alligator,’ and Ajagara, ‘crocodile’ (?); (4) ‘fish,’ Puri1kaya, Jas2a, and Matsya; (5) insects and worms (described as rajasa1h2). But this division is more ingenious than probable, and it is ignored by both Bloomfield 21) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 631. and Whitney. 22) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 633, 634. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. 77.

पशुप
पशु-प
 denotes ‘herdsman’ in the Rigveda. 1) i. 114, 9; 144, 6; iv. 6, 4; x. 142, 2. Metaphorically the term is applied to Pu1s2an. 2) vi. 58, 2. Cf. of Pu1s2an and Revati1, Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 2, 12.

पष्ठवाह्
1. Pas2t2ha-va1h occurs in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 5, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 9; xviii. 27; xxi. 17; xxiv. 13. 28. 29. etc. meaning an ox, four years old, according to the commentators. This qualification is, however, very doubtful, for Pas2t2hauhi1, ‘cow,’ a word occurring quite frequently, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 vii. 1, 6, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 2; xii. 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 27; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 3, 3; 8. 3, 2; ii. 7, 2, 2, etc. is in one passage 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 6, 1, 11. accompanied by the adjective prathama-garbha1h2, ‘having a first calf,’ which disproves the theory of the age adopted by the commentators.

पष्ठवाह्
2. Pas2t2ha-va1h is mentioned as a seer of Sa1mans in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xii. 5, 11. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160.

पस्त्यसद्
पस्त्य-सद्
 (‘sitting in the house’) occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 51, 9. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 211. where the sense seems to be ‘inmate,’ ‘companion.’ 

पस्त्या
पस्त्या
 (fem. pl.) is a word occurring in several passages of the Rigveda. 1) Rv. i. 25, 10; 40, 7; 164, 30; iv, 1, 11; vi, 49, 9; vii. 97, 5; ix, 65, 23; x. 46, 6. See also iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5, where Pastya1 appears as a goddess. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. ascribes to it the meaning of ‘house’ or ‘dwelling,’ in the wide sense of the term, as well as that of the ‘family’ living in the house; and this view is accepted by Zimmer. 3) Altindisches Leben, 149. Cf. Weber, U7ber den Ra1jasu1ya, 43, n. 4; 63. On the other hand, Pischel 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 211-22. So Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 107. finds in two of the passages 5) vi. 49. 9; vii. 97, 5, where the sense is ‘householder’ (gr2ha-stha or gr2hin, as Sa1yan2a renders it). usually referred to Pastya1 the neuter Pastya, which appears in Pastya-sad and in Pastya1-vant (where the length of the second syllable is not primitive¤), and which is certainly found in the Rigveda 6) x. 96, 10. 11. In x. 96, 10, Roth takes pastyoh2 to denote the two parts of the Soma press, but Pischel, 2, 211, accepts Sa1yan2a's rendering ‘heaven and earth.’ In the compounds tripastya of Agni, Rv. viii. 39, 8; va1japastya of Pu1s2an, vi. 58, 2, of Soma, ix. 98, 12; and vi1ra-pastya, v. 50, 4, the primitive word may very well be pastya, not pastya1. in the metaphorical sense of ‘dwelling,’ ascribed to it in the Naighan2t2uka. 7) iii. 4, misquoted by Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 151, 2, as applying to pastya1, whereas it really refers to pastya. In the other passages 8) Rv. i. 25, 10 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 16, 1 = Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 2; ii. 6, 12; 7, 16; iv. 4, 6 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 27; Rv. i. 40, 7; 164, 30 (used of Agni's home); iv. 1, 11; ix. 65, 23; x. 46, 6; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 12, 1 = Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 8 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 7. he thinks the word means ‘rivers’ or ‘waters’; in particular, where Soma in the middle of the Pastya1s 9) Rv. ix. 65, 23. is spoken of, the sees a reference to Kuruks2etra, with its several rivers, 10) Rv. iii. 23, 4. A1paya1, Dr2s2advati1, and Sarasvati1 (cf. 2. Pastya1vant). In some passages 11) Rv. iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5; and in pastya1vant in ix. 97, 18. he sees in Pastya1 the proper name of a stream, just as Sindhu primarily means ‘river,’ then the ‘Indus.’

पस्त्यावन्त्
1. Pastya1-vant, explained in the Pada text as Pastya-vant, occurs in several passages of the Rigveda. In two of them 1) i. 151, 2; ix. 97, 18; but the latter passage is explained by Pischel as referring to Pastya1, the river, and by Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v., as ‘kept in the stall.’ a rich householder seems meant, and in the two others reference to a ‘house’ is clear. 2) Barhis, Rv. ii. 11, 16, ‘of the house’; ks2aya1n pastya1vatah2, iv. 54, 5, ‘abodes having (fixed) habitations.’ Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 212.

पस्त्यावन्त्
2. Pastya1-vant occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 7, 29. in the locative parallel with Sus2oma, S4aryan2a1vant, and A1rji1ka. It must apparently denote a place, as Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 209. argues, probably corresponding to the locality ‘in the middle of the streams’ (madhye pastya1na1m), elsewhere 3) Rv. ix. 65, 23. referred to as the home of Soma. Pischel 4) Op. cit., 2, 219. suggests that Patia1la is meant, though he does not lay any stress on the similarity of name. In the north of Patia1la there are hills where the Soma might have grown. Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 260, 398, 399, takes Pastya1vant as a place-name, but thinks that pastya1 denotes ‘hamlet,’ or, as an epithet of Aditi, refers to her as a ‘housewife’ (Rv. iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5). thought that something connected with the Soma press was meant.

पांसु
पांसु
 in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 109, 2; xii. 1, 26. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 10, 2; Nirukta, xii. 19, etc. denotes ‘dust’ or ‘sand,’ usually in the plural. Among the portents enumerated in the Adbhuta Bra1hman2a 3) vi. 8 (Indische Studien, 1, 40). Cf. Vara1hamihira, Br2hatsam2hita1, xxii. 6. is a rain of dust or sand (pa1m2suvars2a), a phenomenon not rare in India. 4) The adjective pa1m2sura is found in Rv. i. 22, 17, with a variant, pa1m2sula, Sa1maveda, i. 3, 1, 3, 9. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 1, 9.

पाकदूर्वा
पाक-दूर्वा
 is, in a verse of the Rigveda, 1) x. 16, 13. included with Kiya1mbu and Vyalkas4a1 among the plants used for growing on the spot where the corpse of the dead man has been consumed with fire. 2) See Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 342-350; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, xxxix. The verse is repeated in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 3) vi. 4, 1, 2. with the variant Kya1mbu. In the Atharvaveda 4) xviii. 3, 6. the word is read S4a1n2d2adu1rva1. Pa1kadu1rva1 is probably, as Sa1yan2a-understands it, paripakva-du1rva1, ‘ripe or edible millet.’ S4a1n2d2adu1rva1 is explained by the commentator 5) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 850. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. in various ways, as millet ‘having egg-shaped roots’ (i.e., sa1n2d2a, not s4a1n2d2a), or as ‘having long joints,’ with the additional remark that it was called br2haddu1rva1, ‘large millet.’ In the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, on the other hand, the commentary explains Pa1kadu1rva1 as small millet.

पाकस्थामन्कौरयाण
पाक-स्थामन् कौरयाण
 is celebrated as a generous donor  in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 3, 21. 24. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160. suggests, without much reason, that he may have been a king of the Anus.

पाकरु
पाकरु
 is mentioned as a disease, together with Vis2u1cika1 and Ars4as, ‘hæmorrhoids,’ in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 1) xii. 97 Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 393. Its nature is unknown; the etymology 2) From pa1ka, ‘maturity,’ and aru = arus, ‘sore.’ points to the sense of ‘developed sores,’ ‘ulcers.’

पाङ्क्त्र
पाङ्क्त्र
 is the name of an animal mentioned in the list of victims at the As4vamedha, or ‘horse-sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 26. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85. The ‘field-rat’ seems to be meant.

पाञ्चजन्य
पाञ्च-जन्य,
 ‘relating to the five peoples.’ See Pan5cajana1h2.

पाञ्चाल
पाञ्चाल
 means a ‘king of the Pan5ca1la people,’ and is applied to Durmukha in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) viii. 23. and to S4on2a in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 2) xiii. 5, 4, 7. The term is also found in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 3) iii. 29, 1. Cf. Ka1t2haka Anukraman2i1 in Indische Studien, 3 460. See also Pan5ca1la. 

पाञ्चि
पाञ्चि,
 ‘descendant of Pan5can,’ is the name of a teacher mentioned with disapproval in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) i. 2, 5, 9; ii. 1, 4, 27. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 434.

पाटव
पाटव,
 ‘descendant of Pat2u,’ is a patronymic of Ca1kra in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xii. 8, 1, 17; 9, 3, 1).

पाटा
पाटा
 is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 27, 4. and in the Kaus4ika Su1tra. 2) xxxvii. 1; xxxviii. 18. Cf. R2gvidha1na, iv. 12, 1. It is assumed by the commentator to be identical with the later Pa1t2ha1, the plant Clypea hernandifolia, which was much used medicinally, and is still so used at the present day according to Roth. 3) Quoted in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 68. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 190; 17, 266; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 305, n. 1; Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, May, 1885, xlii-xliv. Very possibly the word should be read as Pa1t2ha1.

पाणिघ्न
पाणि-घ्न,
 ‘hand-clapper,’ is enumerated among the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 20; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 15, 1. Presumably a man who drives away birds from the fields by making a noise is intended.

पाण्ड्व
पाण्ड्व
 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (v. 3, 5, 21) denotes an uncoloured woollen garment.

पातल्य
पातल्य
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 17. meaning some part of the chariot. What it was is quite uncertain. Hopkins 2) Journal of the American Oriental Socicty, 13, 242, 243; 20, 224. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 251; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 108. suggests that, as in the Epic, it was possibly a piece of wood on the axle to hold the pole of the car. 

पात्र
पात्र,
 primarily a ‘drinking vessel’ (from pa1, ‘to drink’) denotes a vessel generally both in the Rigveda 1) i. 82, 4; 110, 5; 162, 13 (to hold the broth from the flesh of the horse); 175, 1; ii. 37, 4; vi. 27, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. iv. 17, 4; vi. 142, 1; ix. 6, 17; xii. 3, 25. 36; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 6, 2; vi. 3, 4, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 62; xix. 86. etc. It was made either of wood 3) Rv. i. 175, 3. or clay. 4) Av. iv. 17, 4. In some passages 5) Av. x. 10, 9; xii. 3, 30; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 1, 5; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta S4u1tra, xvi. 1, 7, etc. the word is, according to Roth, used to indicate a measure. The feminine Pa1tri1 occasionally occurs 6) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 17; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 8; ii. 5, 3, 6; 6, 2, 7; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, v. 8, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271. in the sense of ‘vessel.’

पाथ्य
पाथ्य,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) vi. 16, 15. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 4, 2, 4; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 153. is either an epithet meaning ‘being in heaven’ (pa1thas), or a patronymic, as Sa1yan2a interprets it, of Vr2s2an.

पाद
1. Pa1da in the Atharvaveda 1) xiv. 1, 60. and later 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 5. 12; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 8, 3, 6, etc.; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 5. denotes the ‘foot’ of an animal, a bird, and other creatures.

पाद
2. Pa1da, as a measure of length, denotes ‘foot’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) vi. 5, 3, 2; vii. 2, 1, 7; viii. 7, 2, 17; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vi. 10, etc. The term is occasionally 2) Nirukta, ii. 7; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 1, 2. used to express a measure of weight. As a fraction it means a ‘quarter,’ a sense derived from that of ‘foot’ of a quadruped (just as s4apha, the divided hoof, comes to mean an ‘eighth’). ^3) Rv. x. 90, 3. 4.

पाद
3. Pa1da is the regular expression for a ‘quarter verse’ in the Bra1hman2as. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 4; Kaus2i1aki Bra1hman2a, xxvi. 5; Nirukta, vii. 9; xi. 6; La1t2ya1yana Srauta Su1tra, i. 2, 1; x. 6, 9, etc. This sense is merely a limitation of ‘quarter’ = the ‘foot’ of a quadruped 

पान
पान,
 ‘drink,’ occurs in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 4, 2, 17. and the Upanis2ads. 2) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 43; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 2, 7, etc.

पान्त
पान्त
 occurs several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 122, 1; 155, 1; viii. 92, 1; ix. 65, 28 (a very doubtful passage); x. 88, 1. apparently 2) So Nirukta, vii. 25; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 122, 123. meaning ‘drink,’ ‘beverage’ (cf. Pa1na). Geldner, 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 139; Rigveda, Glossar, 108. however, thinks that in one passage^4 Pa1nta is the name of a prince.

पान्नेजन
पान्-नेजन
 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 8, 2, 1; 9, 3, 27; xiii. 5, 2, 1. denotes a ‘vessel for washing the feet.’

पाप-यक्ष्म
 See Yaks2ma.

पापसम
पाप-सम,
 a ‘bad season,’ is in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) iii. 3, 8, 4. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 342. opposed to Pun2ya-sama, a ‘good season.’

पामन्
पामन्
 occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 22, 12. Cf. for the reading, Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 261. See also Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 8. as the name of a skin disease. The derivative adjective, Pa1mana, ‘suffering from skin disease,’ is found in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 3, 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 1, 31. Cf. Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 401 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 388; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 421, n.; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 450, 451; Atharvaveda, 63. Since it is mentioned as an accompaniment of fever, probably a cutaneous eruption or scab consequent on fever is meant.

पायु
1. Pa1yu, meaning ‘guard,’ ‘protector,’ occurs several times in the Rigveda. 1) i. 147, 3; ii. 1, 7; iv. 2, 6; 4, 3. 12; vi. 15, 8; viii. 18, 2; 60, 19; x, 100, 9. 

पायु
2. Pa1yu is found in the Rigveda 1) vi. 47, 24. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 128. as the name of a poet, a Bha1radva1ja. In the Br2haddevata1 2) v. 124 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. he is credited with assisting Abhya1vartin Ca1yama1na and Prastoka Sa1rn3jaya by consecrating their weapons with a hymn. 3) vi. 75 (the ‘battle’ hymn).

पार
पार,
 in accordance with its derivation (pr2, ‘bring across’), denotes the ‘farther bank’ of a river or stream, in which sense 1) It also often has the generalized sense of ‘extreme limit’ or ‘end,’ as in i. 92, 6 (tamasas, ‘of darkness’); v. 54, 10 (adhavanah2, ‘of a road’). it occurs in the Rigveda 2) i. 121, 13 (na1vya1na1m, ‘of streams’); viii. 96, 11 (nadi1na1m); i. 167, 2 (samudrasya); x. 155, 3 (sindhoh2), etc. and later. 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 1, 2. 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiii. 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 6, 2, 4 (salilasya); Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 21 (pa1ra-ka1ma, ‘desiring the farther bank’), etc.

1. Pa1ra1vata occurs in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), in the Yajurveda, 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 25. meaning ‘turtle-dove.’

पारावत
2. Pa1ra1vata occurs in several passages of the Rigveda. Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks that in most places 2) Rv. v. 52, 11; viii. 100, 6; Av. xx. 135, 14; pa1ra1vata-ghni1 of the Sarasvati1, Rv. vi. 61, 2. it means ‘coming from a distance,’ but in two passages 3) Rv. viii. 34, 18; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 4, 11. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 53. he regards it as the proper name of a people on the Yamuna1 (Jumna). It is certain that in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a the Pa1ra1vatas are a people on that river (cf. Turas4ravas). Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 97 et seq.; 3, 310, following Brunnhofer, Iran und Turan, 99. sees in all the passages 5) See notes 2 and 3. the name of a people, comparing the  of Ptolemy, 6) vi. 20, 3. It is suggested by Hillebrandt that the  of Herodotus, iii. 91, may be the same. who apparently were settled on the northern border of Gedrosia, or the , who were found in  7) Ptolemy, vi. 17. He suggests that they were originally ‘mountaineers’ (Cf. Parvata). Ludwig 8) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. 197. holds a similar view, and Geldner 9) Rigveda, Glossar, 109. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 91; Max Mu1ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 316. recognizes a people as meant. The mention of the Sarasvati1 in connexion with the Pa1ra1vatas 2) Rv. v. 52, 11; viii. 100, 6; Av. xx. 135, 14; pa1ra1vata-ghni1 of the Sarasvati1, Rv. vi. 61, 2. in the Rigveda accords generally with their position on the Yamuna1 in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) Rv. viii. 34, 18; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 4, 11. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 53.

पाराशर्य
पाराशर्य,
 ‘descendant of Para1s4ara,’ is mentioned in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad as a pupil of Ja1tu1karn2ya 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3, Ka1n2va; ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27, Ma1dhyam2dina. or of Bha1radva1ja. 2) ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26, Ma1dhyam2dina; ii. 6, 2; iv. 6, 2, 3.

पाराशर्यायण
पाराशर्यायण
 is mentioned in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27 (Ma1dhyam2dina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3, Ka1n2va). as a pupil of Pa1ra1s4arya.

पारिकुट
पारिकुट
 is an obscure word--probably corrupt--occurring in a verse cited in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 22, 7), and apparently meaning ‘attendant.’

पारिक्षित
पारिक्षित,
 ‘descendant of Pariks2it,’ is the patronymic of Janamejaya in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 27 and 34; viii. 11. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 2) xiii. 5, 4, 1. Cf. Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 6; ii. 6, 12. The Pa1riks2iti1ya appear in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) xiii. 5, 4, 3. and the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 4) xvi. 9. 7. as performers of the horse sacrifice. In a Ga1tha1 there cited they are called Pa1riks2itas. Apparently they were the brothers of Janamejaya, named Ugrasena, Bhi1masena, and S4rutasena. In the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 5) iii. 3, 1. the question whither they have gone is made the subject of a philosophical discussion. It is clear that the family had passed away before the time of the Upanis2ad, and it is also clear that there had been some serious scandal mingled with their greatness which they had, in the opinion of the Brahmins, atoned for by their horse sacrifice with its boundless gifts to the priests. Weber 6) Indian Literature, 125, 126; 135, 136. The later legend of the Pa1riks2itas and Va1madeva's mares is dealt with by Weber in Vedische Beitra7ge (1894). sees in this the germ of the Epic stories which are recorded in the Maha1bha1rata. The verses relating to Pariks2it in the Atharvaveda 7) xx. 127, 7-10; S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xii. 17; Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 156, 157. are called Pa1riks2ityah2 in the Bra1hman2as. 8) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 32, 10; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 5; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 12; Weber, op. cit., 136, n. 144.

पारिप्लव
पारि-प्लव,
 ‘cyclic,’ is a term applied to the A1khya1na, or ‘tale,’ which is to be recited at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), and to be repeated at intervals throughout the year. It is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 4, 3, 2. 15. and in the Su1tras. 2) A1s4vala1yana Srauta Su1tra, x. 6; S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xvi. 1, 26; 2, 36; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 9, 11.

पारीणह्य
पारी-णह्य
 denotes household utensils' in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 1) vi. 2, 1, 1. where it is said that the wife (patni1), as mistress of the house, has charge of all these. 2) The word occurs later in the variant form of pa1ri-n2a1hya in Manu, ix. 11.

पारूष्ण
पारूष्ण,
 occurring in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 24. appears to mean some kind of bird.

पारोवर्यविद्
पारोवर्य-विद्
 in the Nirukta (xiii. 12) denotes ‘knowers of tradition.’

पार्णवल्कि
पार्ण-वल्कि,
 ‘descendant of Parn2avalka,’ is the patronymic of Nigada in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 443.

पार्थव
पार्थव,
 ‘descendant of Pr2thu,’ occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) vi. 27, 8. where the Pa1rthavas are mentioned as generous donors. The passage is somewhat obscure, as there is a reference 2) vi. 27, 7. to a defeat of the Turvas4as and the Vr2ci1vants by Sr2n5jaya Daivava1ta, followed in the next verse by the praise of the bounty to the singer of Abhya1vartin Ca1yama1na, who was clearly a Pa1rthava, and who, in the earlier part of the hymn, has been referred to as victorious over Varas4ikha. It is uncertain whether, as Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 133, 134. suggests, the two princes, Abhya1vartin Ca1yama1na and Sr2n5jaya Daivava1ta, are identical or not. 4) Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. That Pa1rthava has any direct connexion with the Parthians, as held by Brunnhofer, is most improbable. 5) Cf. Ludwing, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 196 et seq. Herodotos, iii. 93, mentions the . Cf. Pars4u.

पार्थश्रवस
पार्थ-श्रवस,
 ‘descendant of Pr2thu-s4ravas,’ is found as the name of a demon in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 1) iv. 26, 15. This form of the name is supported by its occurrence in the Kaus4ika Su1tra, ix. 10; xvii. 27. But Pa1rthu-is also possible.

पार्थ्य
पार्थ्य,
 ‘descendant of Pr2thi,’ is the patronymic of some donor in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) x. 93. 15. The form of the name in the As4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xii. 10. Cf. the Anukraman2i1 on Rv. x. 93. is Pa1rtha.

पार्वति

 ‘descendant of Parvata,’ is the patronymic of Daks2a in the S4atapatha (ii. 4, 4, 6) and the Kaus2i1taki (iv. 4) Bra1hman2as.

पार्षद
पार्षद,
 which first appears in the Nirukta, 1) i. 17. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 128 et seq.; Weber, Studien, 3, 269; 4, 217. denotes a textbook recognized by a school of grammarians.

पार्षद्वाण
पार्षद्-वाण,
 ‘descendant of Pr2s2adva1n2a,’ is mentioned as a wonder-worker in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 51, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139.

पार्ष्णशैलन

पालागल
पालागल
 occurs in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) v. 3, 1, 11. Eggeling; Sacred Books of the East, 26, 64, renders it ‘courier.’ apparently in the sense of ‘messenger,’ or ‘bearer of false news.’ 

पालागली
पालागली
 is the name of the fourth and least respected wife of the king. 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 1, 8; 5, 2, 8, etc. See Pati.

पावमानी
पावमानी
 means the verses (r2cas) in the ninth Man2d2ala of the Rigveda ‘relating to Soma Pavama1na’ (‘purifying itself’). The name is found in the Atharvaveda 1) xix. 71, 1. and later, 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 20; ii. 37; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xv. 1; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 8, 1, 10; Nirukta, xi. 2; xii. 31; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 2, 2, etc.; Maitra1yan2i1 Gr2hya Su1tra, ii. 14. possibly even in one hymn of the Rigveda itself. 3) ix. 67, 31. 32; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 99. n. 3.

पाश
पाश
 denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 24, 13. 15; ii. 27, 16; 29, 5. etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 12, 2; ix. 3, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vi. 8. 45, etc. a ‘rope’ used for fastening or tying up. Rope and knot (granthi) are mentioned together in the Atharvaveda. 3) ix. 3, 2. Pa1s4a is in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 4) i. 8, 1, 5. used of the rope by which Manu's ship was fastened to the mountain. It is often employed metaphorically of the ‘fetter’ of Varun2a. 5) Rv. vi. 74, 4; vii. 88, 7; x. 85, 24; Av. iv. 16, 6; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 5, 1, etc.

पाश-द्युम्न वायत
 is the name of a king to whom the Vasis2t2has claim to have been preferred by Indra in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) vii. 33. 2. Apparently he was, as Sa1yan2a says, son of Vayat, who may be compared with the Vyat of another passage of the Rigveda. 2) i. 122, 4. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. sees in him a priest of the Pr2thus and Pars4us, but this is most improbable. 4) Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 130, 139.

पाष्य
पाष्य
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 56, 6. with reference to the defeat of Vr2tra, and apparently denotes ‘stone bulwarks.’ In another passage 2) ix. 102, 2. Cf. Macdone, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1893, 457, 458. the word may mean the stones used for pressing Soma.

पिक
पिक,
 the Indian ‘cuckoo,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 15, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 20; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 39. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92. Cf. Anyava1pa, Koka.

पिङ्गा
पिङ्गा
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 69, 9. where it is explained by the St. Petersburg Dictionary with Sa1yan2a as ‘bowstring,’ but where Hillebrandt 2) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 144, n. thinks that a musical instrument of some kind is meant.

पिजवन
पिजवन
 is the name of the father of Suda1s according to the Nirukta. 1) ii. 24. Probably this statement is based on a mere conjecture from the epithet Paijavana used of Suda1s in a verse of the Rigveda, 2) vii. 18, 19. So Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 21. but may very well be correct.

पिञ्जूल
पिञ्जूल
 denotes a ‘bundle’ of grass or stalks, especially of Darbha. The word is only found in the Bra1hman2a style. 1) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 3; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xviii. 8. It appears in the form of pin5jula in Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 8, 7; Pa1raskara Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 15; of Pun5ji1la in Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 1, 7; 2, 4, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 6, 4; ii. 7, 9, 5.

पिण्ड
पिण्ड,
 denoting specifically a ball of flour offered to the Manes, especially on the evening of new moon, occurs in the Nirukta, 1) iii. 4. and repeatedly in the Su1tras. 2) La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 10, 4, etc. 

पितापुत्र
पिता-पुत्र,
 ‘father and son,’ is a compound of rare occurrence. 1) Av. vi. 112, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 4, 4.

पितापुत्रीय
पिता-पुत्रीय
 (‘relating to father and son’), used with Samprada1na (‘handing over’) means the ceremony by which a father, when about to die, bequeathes his bodily and mental powers to his son. It is described in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad. 1) ii. 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 408.

पितामह
पिता-मह,
 beside Tata1maha, denotes from the Atharvaveda onwards 1) Av. v. 5, 1; ix. 5, 30; xi. 1, 19; xviii. 4, 35; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 5, 1; vii. 2, 7, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 36; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 5, 4. the ‘paternal grandfather,’ apparmtly as a ‘father in a higher sense.’ 2) Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 474. The great-grandfather is Prapita1maha and Pratata1maha. 3) Av. xviii. 4, 75. It is significant that there are no corre4sponding Vedic words for maternal grandparents, and that the words used in the latter language, such as Ma1ta1maha, are imitations of the terms for paternal relations. In one passage of the Rigveda 4) vi. 20. 11. Delbru7ck 5) Ibid., 473. suggests that mahe pitre means ‘grandfather,’ a sense which would well suit the napa1tam, ‘grandson,’ following, but the sense of the whole passage is uncertain. 6) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 128, n. 1. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., also doubts the view which is accepted by Delbru7ck, and denies that in Rv. i. 71, 5, the sense of ‘grandfather’ can be found. We learn very little from the texts of the position of grandparents. No doubt they were entitled to marks of respect similar to those shown to parents, 7) Delbru7ck, op. cit., 480, citing Maha1bha1rata, ii. 1634. as the epic expressly testifies. A grandfather might easily be the head of the family, or be living with his eldest son, after he ceased to be able to control the family. The grandmother (Pita1mahi1) is not mentioned in the extant Vedic literature. 

पितु
पितु
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 61, 7; 132, 6; 187, 1; vi. 20, 4, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 6, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 7, 2, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 20; xii. 65; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 13. has the general sense of ‘nutriment,’ whether food or drink.

पितृ
पितृ,
 common from the Rigveda onwards, denotes ‘father,’ not so much as the ‘begetter’ (janitr2), 1) Pita1 janita1, is used of gods in the Rigveda--e.g., iv. 17, 12. but rather as the protector of the child, this being probably also the etymological sense of the word. 2) As derived from pa1, ‘protect.’ But, as Bo7htlingk and Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Ma1tar, footnote, suggest, pa and ma1 were probably the much older original onomatopoetic names for ‘father’ and ‘mother,’ which in a later reflective age influenced the formation of pitr2 and ma1tr2 (which themselves go back to the Indo-European period). The father in the Rigveda 3) See, e.g., iv. 17, 17; viii. 86, 4. stands for all that is good and kind. Hence Agni is compared with a father, 4) Rv. x. 7, 3. while Indra is even dearer than a father. 5) Rv. vii. 32, 19; viii. 1, 6. The father carries his son in his arms, 6) Rv. i. 38, 1. and places him on his lap, 7) Rv. v. 43, 7. while the child pulls his garment to attract attention. 8) Rv. iii. 53, 2. In later years the son depends on his father for help in trouble, 9) In Rv. x. 48, 1, the jantavah2 possibly are the sons. and greets him with joy. 10) Rv. vii. 103, 3. Cf. 1, 24, 1. It is difficult to ascertain precisely how far the son was subject to parental control, and how long such control continued. Reference is made in the Rigveda 11) Rv. ii. 29, 5. to a father's chastising his son for gambling, and R2jra1s4va is said to have been blinded by his father. 12) Rv. i. 116, 16; 117, 17. There is also the case of the sale of Sunah2s4epa, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 12-18; and cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 3, 3. From the latter statement Zimmer 13) Altindisches Leben, 316. infers the existence of a developed patria potestas, but to lay stress on this isolated and semi-mythical incident would be unwise. It is, however, quite likely that the patria potestas was originally strong, for we have other support for the thesis in the Roman patria potestas. If there is no proof that a father legally controlled his son's wedding, 14) Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 576. Ibid., 582, he quotes Maha1bha1rata, xii. 6108 et seq., which refers in one line to the control of the marriage of the son by the father, and in the next to a case of free marriage. The fact is, no doubt, that the son could marry freely, unless his father had arranged matters for him when he was too young to object. and not much that he controlled his daughter's, 15) Zimmer, op. cit., 309, assumes this as certain, but it is far from proved. See, however, Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 12, 2, which is in favour of Zimmer's view. Cf. Kaegi, Dev Rigveda, 15, and Pati. the fact is in itself not improbable. There is again no evidence to show whether a son, when grown up, normally continued to stay with his father, his wife becoming a member of the father's household, or whether he set up a house of his own: probably the custom varied. Nor do we know whether the son was granted a special plot of land on marriage or otherwise, or whether he only came into such property after his father's death. But any excessive estimate of the father's powers over a son who was no longer a minor and naturally under his control, must be qualified by the fact that in his old age the sons might divide their father's property, 16) Rv. i. 70, 10; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 14; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 156 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 61, 62). or he might divide it amongst them, 17) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 9, 4-6. Cf. the handing over from father to son in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, ii. 15. If the father recovered, he lived subject to his son. and that when the father-in-law became aged he fell under the control of his son's wife. 18) Rv. x. 85, 46. There are also obscure traces that in old age a father might be exposed, though there is no reason to suppose that this was usual in Vedic India. 19) Cf. Rv. viii. 51, 2; Av. xviii. 2, 34. The first passage need not refer to exposure, and the second merely refers to the exposure of a dead body; but Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 326-328, thinks that they prove exposure. Cf. Dharma. Normally the son was bound to give his father full obedience. 20) Rv. i. 68, 5 The later Su1tras show in detail the acts of courtesy which he owed his father, and they allow him to eat the remnants of his father's food. 21) A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, i. 1, 4, 11. On the other hand, the father was expected to be kind. The story of S4unah2s4epa in the Aitareya Bra1h man2a 22) vii. 12 et seq.; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 17 et seq. emphasizes the horror with which the father's heartless treatment of his son was viewed. The Upanis2ads 23) E.g., Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, ii. 15; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 5, 25 (Ma1dhyam2dina = i. 5, 17, Ka1n2va). insist on the spiritual succession from father to son. The kissing of a son 24) See Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 28, 120-134; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 26, n. 3. was a frequent and usual token of affection, even in mature years. On the failure of natural children, adoption was possible. 25) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 318; Mayr, Indisches Erbrecht, 73; Jolly, Die Adoption in Indien (Wu7rzburg, 1910), 7 et seq. It was even resorted to when natural children existed, but when it was desired to secure the presence in the family of a person of specially high qualifications, as in Vis4va1mitra's adoption of S4unah2s4epa. 26) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17 et seq.; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 17. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 157. It is not clear that adoption from one caste into another was possible, for there is no good evidence that Vis4va1mitra was, as Weber 27) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 33, 34. holds, a Ks2atriya who adopted a Bra1hman2a. Adoption was also not always in high favour: it may be accidental or not that a hymn of the Vasis2t2ha book of the Rigveda 28) vii. 4, 7. 8. condemns the usage. It was also possible for the father who had a daughter, but no sons, to appoint her to bear a son for him. At any rate the practice appears to be referred to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda 29) iii. 31, 1. as interpreted by Ya1ska. 30) iii. 5 ad fin. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 343; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 34; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 239-241. Moreover, it is possible that the difficulty of a brotherless maiden finding a husband 31) Cf. Bhra1tr2. may have been due in part to the possibility of her father desiring to make her a Putrika1, the later technical name for a daughter whose son is to belong to her father's family. There can be no doubt that in a family the father took precedence of the mother. 32) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 1, 18; a citation in S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 9; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad vii. 15, 2. Delbru7ck 33) Die {|indogermanischen|} Verwandtschaftsnamen, 577. explains away the apparent cases to the contrary. 34) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 7, 5. Some passages in the Su1tras present difficulties, but they are of no importance for Vedic times proper. There is no trace of the family as a land-owning corporation. 35) Baden Powell, whose various works (Indian Village Community, 1896; Village Communities in India, 1899, etc.) have done most to combat the view of the village community in India as a land-holding institution, is prepared to recognize the family as a land-owning unit, considering that the patria potestas is a later growth, and not Indian (see, e.g., Village Communities in India, 128 et seq.). Hopkins, India, Old and New, 218 et seq., adopts a theory which allows of individual and joint family ownership side by side, the latter being apparently the earlier but the decadent stage. He expressly considers (p. 222) that the son had an indefeasible right to prevent the father from alienating the hereditary land, which could only be parted with by the consent of the village if it were a case of joint ownership (cf. the verse cited by Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 94). But it must be remembered that, as is very clearly shown in the case of English law by Pollock and Maitland (History of English Law, 2, 337-352), the recognition of the rights of sons may well be, not a sign of original joint or family ownership, but a development from the existence of intestate succession, and as in England, so in India, there is no trace of a corporate joint family in the early books. And, as Jolly (op. cit., 76, 80) shows, there are clear traces, both in old and modern times, of a despotic control of the family by the father even after his sons grew up, provided only that he was physically able to control them. The same state of affairs seems proved for early English law, as it is beyond question for Roman law (see Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, 2, 351 et seq.). In Greece also, which is sometimes contrasted with Rome, there is the clearest trace of both a real patria potestas, and of the absolute ownership of the land by the father as against the son, especially in the archaic laws of Gortyn (see Gardner and Jevons, Greek Antiquities, 404, 405, 563, 566). The dual form Pitarau regularly means ‘father and mother,’ ‘parents.’ 36) Rv. i. 20, 4; 160, 3; ii. 17, 7; vii. 67, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 11, etc.

पितृयाण
पितृ-याण,
 the ‘way of the fathers,’ mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 2, 7. Cf. the allusion to it in x. 18, 1, as other than the Devava1na, which appears in x. 98, 11. and later, 2) Av. viii. 10, 19; xii. 2, 10, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 45; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 3, 2, etc. is opposed to the Deva-ya1na, or ‘way of the gods.’ Tilak 3) Orion, 22 et seq. considers that the Devaya1na corresponds with the Uttara1yan2a, ‘northern journey’ of the sun, and the Pitr2ya1n2a with the Daks2in2a1yana, its ‘southern journey.’ He concludes from a passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 4) ii. 1, 3, 1-3. where three of the seasons--spring, summer, and the rains--are ascribed to the gods, but the others to the Pitr2s, or Fathers, that the Devaya1na began with the vernal equinox, and the Pitr2ya1n2a with the autumnal equinox. With this he connects the curious distinction of Devaand Yama-Naks2atras in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 5) i. 5, 2, 6. These conclusions are, however, very improbable. Cf. Naks2atra and Su1rya.

पितृहन्
पितृ-हन्,
 ‘parricide,’ is found in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 4, 3. Cf. Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. Paippala1da recension.

पित्र्य
पित्र्य
 occurs in the list of sciences given in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 1) vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 267; Little, Grammatical Index, 98. Apparently it is to be taken as the science relating to the cult of the Manes, as explained by S4an3kara in his commentary. As it is in that list followed by Ra1s4i, the St. Petersburg Dictionary is inclined to take Pitrya Ra1s4i as one expression, but in what exact sense does not appear.

पित्व
पित्व
 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 17, 1. or Pidva 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 13; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 32. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 79; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 29, 290. is the name of an animal included in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. According to the commentator on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 17, 1. it means ‘lion.’ But it may be identical with Petva.

पिनाक
पिनाक,
 ‘club,’ is found in the Atharvaveda. 1) i. 27, 2. Later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 6, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 61; xvi. 51. etc. it is used to denote the club of Rudra-S4iva.

पिन्वन
पिन्वन
 occurs in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xiv. 1, 2, 17; 2, 1, 11; 3, 1, 22) as the name of a vessel used in the ritual.

पिपील
पिपील,
 ‘ant,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda (x. 16, 6) as eating the flesh of the dead. 

पिपीलिका
पिपीलिका
 in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 56, 7. Cf. xx. 134. 6. and later 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 6, 7; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 6, 10; xv. 17, 8; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 4, 9. 29 (Ma1dhyam2dina = i. 4, 4, 16 Ka1n2va); Nirukta, vii. 13; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 3, 8; ii. 1, 6. denotes an ‘ant,’ the form of the word referring doubtless not so much to the small species of ant, as it is taken in the later lexicons, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. but rather to the insect's tiny size, which would naturally be expressed by a diminutive formation of the name. The form Pipi1laka 4) Cf. kani1naka beside kani1nika1, ‘pupil of the eye.’ is found in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 5) vii. 2, 1; 7, 1; 8, 1; 10, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97; Edgerton, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 31, 128.

पिप्पका
पिप्पका
 is mentioned in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 19, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 21; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 40. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. Some bird seems to be meant.

पिप्पल
पिप्पल,
 n., is found in two passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 20 = Mun2d2aka Upanis2ad, iii. 1, 1; S4veta1s4vatara Upanis2ad, iv. 6, 22; v. 54, 12 (the ‘berry’ of heaven, na1ka). meaning ‘berry,’ used with a mystic signification, and in neither case with any certain reference to the berry of the fig-tree. 2) The word Pippala appears in the later literature as a masculine, denoting the Ficus veligiosa (As4vattha in Vedic literature). In the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 3) iv. 1, 41. the general sense of ‘berry’ is not necessary, and the special sense of ‘berry’ of the Peepal is quite possible: the latter meaning is perhaps intended in the Satapatha Bra1hmana. 4) iii. 7, 1, 12. In the Atharvaveda 5) vi. 109, 1, 2. the feminine form of the word, Pippali1, appears denoting berries used as a remedy for wounds, like Arundhati1. 6) Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 516; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 359, 360; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 389; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 331. 

पिप्पलाद
पिप्पलाद
 (‘eater of berries’) is the name of a teacher mentioned in the Pras4na Upanis2ad. 1) i. 1. In the plural the name denotes a school of the Atharvaveda. 2) Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 277; Indian Literature, 153, 159, 160, 164. Their (Paippala1da) recension of the text of the Sam2hita1 has been reproduced in facsimile by Garbe and Bloomfield, 3) Baltimore, 1901. and in part published. 4) The variants of the Paippala1da are given in part in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, and the text of books i. and ii. has been edited by Barret in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 197-295; 30, 187 et seq. Cf. also Lanman in Whitney's Translation, lxxix et seq.

पिप्रु
पिप्रु
 is the name of a foe of Indra in the Rigveda. He was repeatedly defeated by Indra for R2jis4van. 1) i. 101, 1, 2; iv. 16, 13; v. 29, 11; vi. 20, 7; viii. 49, 10; x. 99, 11; 138, 3. In i. 103, 8; ii. 14, 5; vi. 18, 8, the reference is general to a defeat of Pipru by Indra. Mentioned as possessing forts, 2) Rv. i. 51, 5; vi. 20, 7. he is called a Da1sa 3) Rv. viii. 32, 2. as well as an Asura. 4) Rv. x. 138, 3. He is described as having a black brood, 5) Rv. i. 101, 1. and as being allied with blacks. 6) iv. 16, 13. It is uncertain whether he was a demon, according to Roth's 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. view, which is favoured by the use of the word Asura, or a human foe, as Ludwig, 8) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 149. Oldenberg, 9) Religion des Veda, 155. and Hillebrandt 10) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 273. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 161 (C). believe. The name may mean ‘resister,’ from the root pr2.

पिश
पिश
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 64, 8. Cf. Av. xix. 49, 4; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 118; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 110. where Sa1yan2a takes it to mean a deer (ruru).

पिशङ्ग
पिशङ्ग
 is the name of one of the two Unnetr2 priests officiating at the snake festival mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35. Cf. Caka. 

पिशाच
पिशाच
 is the name of a class of demon mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 18, 4; iv. 20, 6. 9; 36, 4; 37, 10; v. 29, 4. 5. 14; vi. 32, 2; viii. 2, 12; xii. 1, 50. The word occurs once in the Rv. (i. 133, 5) in the form of Pis4a1ci. and later. 2) See St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) ii. 4, 1, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 14. they are associated with Raks2ases and Asuras, while opposed to gods, men, and fathers. In the Atharvaveda 4) v. 25, 9. they are described as kravya1d, ‘eaters of raw flesh,’ which may be the etymological sense of the word Pis4a1ca itself. 5) Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 264, n. It is possible that the Pis4a1cas were, as suggested by Grierson, 6) Cf. Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1905, 285-288. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 164 (B). really human foes, like the north-western tribes, who even in later times were reputed eaters of raw flesh (not necessarily as cannibals, but rather as eaters of human flesh in ritual). This is, however, not at all likely, the Pis4a1cas having in all probability only meant ‘ghouls’ originally: when they appear as human tribes, they were presumably thus designated in scorn. A science called Pis4a1caveda 7) Gopatha Bra1hman2a. i. 1, 10. or Pis4a1ca-vidya1 8) A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 7, 6. is known in the later Vedic period.

पिशित
पिशित
 in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 19, 5. and later 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 11; Kaus4ika Su1tra, xii. 8; xxxv. 18; xxxix. 14. etc. denotes raw flesh (of. Pis4a1ca). In one passage of the Atharvaveda 3) vi. 127, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 531; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376. the sense seems to be ‘small piece,’ ‘bit,’ but the St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that Pis4ita here stands for pis2ita, equivalent to pis2t2a (what is ‘pounded,’ then ‘particle’).

पिशील
पिशील
 is found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (ii. 5, 3, 6) as the name of a wooden vessel or dish. In the La1t2ya1yana S4rauta1 Su1tra (iv. 2, 4. 5) a Pis4i1la-vi1n2a1 is mentioned, which seems to have been a kind of guitar, with strings stretched over a body of wood. 

पिशुन
पिशुन,
 ‘traitor,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vii. 104, 20. and occasionally later. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 13; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vii. 6, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 7, 1.

पीठ
पीठ,
 ‘stool,’ does not occur as an uncompounded word before the Su1tras, but the compound pi1t2ha-sarpin (‘moving about in a little cart’) is found as the designation of a ‘cripple’ in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (xxx. 21) and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (iii. 4, 17, 1) in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’).

पीतुदारु

 is found in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 1) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 6. and later 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 2, 15; xiii. 4, 4, 5, 17; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 13, 5. denoting the Deodar (deva-da1ru) tree, or, according to others, the Khadira or Udumbara tree. 3) Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, v. 14; Sa1yan2a on Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 28. Cf. Pu1tadru.

पीयूष
पीयूष
 is found in the Rigveda 1) Cf. ii. 35, 5, where it is applied figuratively to the mothers of Agni. and later 2) Kaus4ika Su1tra, xix. 15. Cf. Av. viii. 9, 24. in the sense of the first milk of the cow after calving, ‘biestings.’ Usually the term is applied metaphorically to the sap of the Soma plant. 3) Rv. ii. 13, 1; iii. 48, 2; vi. 47, 4; x. 94, 8, etc. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 110.

पीला
पीला
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 37, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 211. as the name of an  Apsaras, being no doubt originally a name of some fragrant plant, like Naladi1 and Guggulu1, two other names of Apsarases given in the same verse.

पीलु
पीलु
 is the name in the Atharvaveda 1) xx. 135, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62; Weber, Transactions of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 861. of a tree (Careya arborea or Salvadora persica) on the fruit of which doves fed.

पीलुमती
पीलुमती
 is in the Atharvaveda (xviii. 2, 48) the name of the intermediate heaven lying between the udanuvati1, ‘watery,’ and the pra-dyauh2, ‘farthest heaven.’ It presumably means ‘rich in Pi1lu.’ Cf. Div.

See also Dharma and Pati.

पुंसवन
पुं-सवन
 (‘male-production’ ceremony) is found in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 11, 1. in a hymn which is obviously intended to accompany a rite aiming at securing the birth of a male child and which is so applied in the ritual. 2) Kaus4ika Su1tra, xxxv. 8. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 460; whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 288. The later Gr2hya ritual knows a special rite called Pum2savana. See A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 13; Sa1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 20; Gobhila Gr2hya Su1tra, ii. 6, 1 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 41.

Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 56, 553; Bu1hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 148; Oldenberg, Buddha, 394, n. For the later geographical position of the Pun2d2ras, cf. the map in Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 333. In the Epic their country corresponds with Bengal and Bihar.

पुत्र
पुत्र
 is, with Su1nu, the usual name for ‘son’ from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. ii. 29, 5; v. 47, 6; vi. 9, 2, etc.; Av. iii. 30, 2, etc. The original sense of the word was apparently ‘small,’ or something analogous. 2) Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 454. The form Putraka 3) Rv. viii. 69, 8; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 14; vi. 33 (here the narrative uses Putra; the reported words have Putraka); Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 1, 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 21, etc. is often used with the distinct intention of an affectionate address to a younger man, not merely a son proper. Reference is frequently made to the desire for a son. 4) Rv. x. 183, 1; Av. vi. 81, 3; xi. 1, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 6, 1; vii. 1, 8, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 9, 1. Cf. Pati.

पुत्रिका
 in the later literature 1) Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra, ix. 127 et seq.; Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xxviii. 20; Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, xvii. 17. has the technical sense of the daughter of a man without sons, whom he gives in marriage on the express terms that her son shall perform the funeral rites for him, and be counted as his. The thing as well as the name is recognized by Ya1ska in the Nirukta, 2) iii. 5 ad fin. and traced to the Rigveda. 3) i. 124, 7. Cf. iii. 31, 1. But the passages in the Rigveda are of very uncertain meaning, 4) Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 34; Rigveda, Kommentar, 48, 49; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 239 et seq.; Roth, Nirukta,' Erla1uterungen, 27; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 72, 73; Br2haddevata1, iv. 110. 111, with Macdonell's note; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 924, 925; Jolly, Die Adoption in Indien, 32. and in all probability do not refer to this custom at all.

पुनर्वसु
पुनर्-वसु
 (‘bringing goods again’), used in the dual, denotes the fifth in the series of the Vedic Naks2atras, or ‘Lunar Mansions.’ Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. takes the word to have this sense in its only occurrence in the Rigveda, 2) x. 19, 1. but this must be regarded as decidedly doubtful. The term is, however, found in the ordinary lists of the Naks2atras in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 3) Av. xix. 7, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 1, 4; iv. 4, 10, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 3; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, i. 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 15; xxxix. 13; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 2, 10, etc. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 289, 290; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 355. 

पुनःसर
पुनः-सर,
 ‘recurrent,’ is the epithet of the barking dog in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 55, 3; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 56, n. 1. which is told to bark at the thief. It refers, not doubt, to the dog's practice of running to and fro when it barks. It is also applied to a plant, Apa1ma1rga (Achyranthes aspera), in the Atharvaveda, 2) iv. 17, 2; vi. 129, 3; x. 1, 9. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 179. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 394, prefers the sense of ‘attacking,’ which is the meaning of prati-sara, Av. viii. 5, 5. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 4, 20. with the sense of ‘having revertent leaves.’

 denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 124, 7; 162, 22; iii. 29, 13; iv. 3, 10, etc. and later 2) Av. iii. 6, 1; 23, 3; iv. 4, 4; vi. 11, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 5, etc. man as the ‘male.’ It has no special reference to marriage like Pati, or to heroism like Nr2 or Nara. In grammar it denotes the masculine gender. 3) Nirukta, iii. 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 1, 1, 8; 5, 1, 3; Cf. iv. 5, 2, 10, and pum2s2a1 naks2atren2a, ‘a Naks2atra with a masculine name,’ in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 1.

पुर्
पुर्
 is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda 1) i. 53, 7, 58, 8; 131, 4; 166, 8; iii. 15, 4; iv. 27, 1, etc. and later, 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 7, 5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 23; ii. 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 4, 3; vi. 3, 3, 25; xi. 1, 1, 2, 3; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 5, 3, etc. meaning ‘rampart,’ ‘fort,’ or ‘stronghold.’ Such fortifications must have been occasionally of considerable size, as one is called ‘broad’ (pr2thvi1) and ‘wide’ (urvi1). 3) i. 189, 2. Elsewhere 4) Rv. iv. 30, 20. Perhaps sun-dried bricks are alluded to by a1ma1 (lit. ‘raw,’ ‘unbaked’) in Rv. ii. 35, 6. a fort ‘made of stone’ (as4mamayi1) is mentioned. Sometimes strongholds ‘of iron’ (a1yasi1) are referred to, 5) Rv. i. 58, 8; ii. 20, 8; iv. 27, 1. vii. 3, 7; 15, 4; 95, 1; x. 101, 8. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 378 et seq. but these are probably only metaphorical. A fort ‘full of kine’ (gomati1) is mentioned, 6) Av. viii. 6, 23. showing that strongholds were used to hold cattle. ‘Autumnal’ (s4a1radi1) forts are named, apparently as belonging to the Da1sas: this may refer to the forts in that season being occupied against A1ryan attacks or against inundations caused by overflowing rivers. Forts ‘with a hundred walls’ (s4atabhuji) are spoken of. 7) Rv. i. 166, 8; vii. 15, 14. It would probably be a mistake to regard these forts as premanently occupied fortified places like the fortresses of the mediæval barony. They were probably merely places of refuge against attack, ramparts of hardened earth with palisades and a ditch (cf. Dehi1). Pischel and Geldner, 8) Vedische Studien, 1, xxii, xxiii, where ks2iti dhruva1, i. 73, 4, is compared. however, think that there were towns with wooden walls and ditches ( and ) like the Indian town of Pa1t2aliputra known to Megasthenes 9) Strabo, p. 702; Arrian, Indica, 10. and the Pa1li texts. 10) Maha1parinibba1nasutta, p. 12. Cf. Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 262. This is possible, but hardly susceptible of proof, and it is not without significance that the word Nagara is of late occurrence. On the whole it is hardly likely that in early Vedic times city life was much developed. In the Epic, according to Hopkins, 11) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 77; 174 et seq. there are found the Nagara, ‘city’; Gra1ma, ‘village’; and Ghos2a, ‘ranch.’ Vedic literature hardly seems to go beyond the village, no doubt with modifications in its later period. The siege of forts is mentioned in the Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as. 12) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 3, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 23; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 4, 3-5; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 7, etc. According to the Rigveda, 13) vii. 5, 3. Possibly, in some cases, the palisade was no more than a hedge of thorn or a row of stakes (cf. Rv. x. 101, 8), as suggested by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 143, 145; and cf. Rv. viii. 53, 5, as corrected by Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 109. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 142148, who compares the fact that neither the Germans (Tacitus, Germania, 16) nor the Slavs (Procopius, De bello Gotico, iii. 14) lived in towns, but, like the ancient Indians, were scattered in villages, each consisting of the houses and steadings of the several families living in the village. The evidence seems pretty convincing. It is true that the Greeks, when we first find them, evidently knew castles and fortresses of the mediæval type; but the Greeks were clearly an invading race, superimposed on an older and in civilization more advanced people (see, e.g., Burrows, Discoveries in Crete). But the Pur may, as Zimmer allows, have sometimes been built within the limits of the village. Whether, as he urges (144), the s4a1radi1 pur was a protection against the floods of antumn is uncertain. Cf. Rv. i. 131, 4; 174, 2; vi. 20, 10. In particular, it is not legitimate to connect the mention of those forts with the fact that the Pu1rus lived on either side of the Sindhu (Indus), and to assume that Purukutsa's attack on the aborigines was directed against the forts in which they normally protected themselves on the rising of the river. No argument for the large size of cities can be drawn from the mention in the Ka1t2haka Upanis2ad, v. 1, of eka1das4a-dva1ra as an epithet of Pura (cf. S4veta1s4vatara Upanis4ad, iii. 18; nava-dva1ra pura, ‘the citadel of nine doors’), because it is used metaphorically of the body, and the number of doors depends on the nature of the body (Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 185). The evidence of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 1, 1, 2, 3, seems rather to point to only one gate in a city. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 412; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 451; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 229; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 203, and Maha1pur. fire was used. 

पुरंधि
पुरं-धि
 occurs in the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 398. possibly as the name of a woman, a prote4ge4e of the As4vins, who gave her a son, Hiran2yahasta.

पुरय
पुरय
 is the name of a patron celebrated in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda. 1) vi. 63, 9. Cf. Ludwing, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158.

1. Pura1n2a, denoting a tale ‘of olden times,’ is often found 1) Sata1patha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 6, 8; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 4, 1. 2; vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. in the combination Itiha1sa-Pura1n2a, which is probably a Dvandva compound meaning ‘Itiha1sa and Pura1n2a.’ It sometimes 2) Av. xv. 6, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 3, 13; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 9; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 53; Pura1n2a-veda: S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 2, 27; Pura1n2avidya1: A1s4vala1yana Srauta Su1tra, x. 7, etc. occurs as a separate word, but beside Itiha1sa, no doubt with the same sense as in the Dvandva. Sa1yan2a 3) Introduction to Aitareya Bra1hman2a, cited by St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. defines a Pura1n2a as a tale which deals with the primitive condition of the universe and the creation of the world, but there is no ground for supposing that this view is correct, or for clearly distinguishing Itiha1sa and Pura1n2a. See Itiha1sa.

पुराण
2. Pura1n2a is the name of a R2s2i in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 (xxxix. 7). 

पुरीकय
पुरीकय
 is the name of a water animal in the Atharvaveda, 1) xi. 2, 25. being clearly a variant of the name that appears as Puli1kaya in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 2) iii. 14, 2. Puli1ka1, ibid., 5, is a variant of Kuli1ka1. and as Kuli1paya in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 3) xxiv. 21. 35. and as Kuli1kaya in the Taittiri1, Bra1hman2a. 4) v. 5, 13, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96; Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 557; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 621. What animal is meant is quite unknown.

पुरीषिणी
पुरीषिणी
 is found in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) v. 53, 9. apparently either as the name of a river, 2) An alternative suggested by Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or much more probably as an epithet of the Sarayu, 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 17; Geldner, Riveda, Glossar, 111. meaning, perhaps, ‘abounding in water,’ ‘swollen,’ 4) Geldner, loc. cit. or ‘carrying rubble.’ 5) Roth, loc. cit.

पुरुकुत्स
पुरु-कुत्स
 is the name of a king who is mentioned several times in the Rigveda. In one passage 1) i. 63, 7. he is mentioned as a contemporary of Suda1s, but whether as a foe, according to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 174, emending suda1se in the text to suda1sam, plausibly, but not, of course, convincingly. or merely as a contemporary, according to Hillebrandt, 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 115. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 204. 205, 219. is uncertain. In two other passages 4) i. 112, 7, 14; 174, 2. he is mentioned as victorious by divine favour, and in another 5) vi. 20, 10. Cf. i. 63, 7, where Pu1ru also is mentioned. Ludwig suggests reading in vi. 20, 10, sauda1si1h2 for da1si1h2, referring to the forts of Suda1s; but this must be regarded as illegitimate. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift, 55, 330. he appears as a king of the Pu1rus and a conqueror of the Da1sas. His son was Trasadasyu, 6) Rv. iv. 42, 8. 9. who is accordingly called Paurukutsya 7) Rv. v. 33, 8; viii. 19, 36. or Paurukutsi. 8) Rv. vii. 19, 3. Different conclusions have been drawn from one hymn of the Rigveda 9) Rv. iv. 42, 8. 9, with Sa1yan2a's note; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 266, 267. in which the birth of Purukutsa's son, Trasadasyu, is mentioned. The usual interpretation is that Purukutsa was killed in battle or captured, whereupon his wife secured a son to restore the fortunes of the Pu1rus. But Sieg 10) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 96-102. offers a completely different interpretation. According to him the word daurgahe, which occurs in the hymn, and which in the ordinary view is rendered ‘descendant of Durgaha,’ an ancestor of Purukutsa, is the name of a horse, the hymn recording the success of an As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) undertaken by Purukutsa for his wife, as by kings in later times, to secure a son. This interpretation is supported by the version of daurgahe given in the S4atapatha, 11) xiii. 5, 4, 5. but is by no means certain. Moreover, if Purukutsa was a contemporary of Suda1s, the defeat of the Pu1rus by Suda1s in the Da1s4ara1jn5a 12) vii. 18. Cf. also the reference to a Pu1ru defeat in vii. 8, 4. might well have been the cause of the troubles from which Purukutsa1ni1, by the birth of Trasadasyu, rescued the family. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 13) xiii. 5, 4, 5. Cf. Iks2va1ku, Tryarun2a, and Oldenberg, Buddha, 403. Purukutsa is called an Aiks2va1ka.

पुरुकुत्सानी
पुरुकुत्सानी,
 ‘wife of Purukutsa,’ is mentioned as the mother of Trasadasyu in one hymn of the Rigveda (iv. 42, 9).

पुरुणीथशातवनेय
पुरु-णीथ शात-वनेय
 (‘descendant of S4atavani’) is the name of a sacrificer, or perhaps a priest, a Bha1radva1ja, in the Rigveda. 1) i. 59, 7. It is doubtful whether he is also mentioned as a singer in another passage of the Rigveda. 2) vii. 9. 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 60. In both places Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. sees in Puru-n2i1tha merely a word meaning ‘choral song.’

पुरुदम
पुरु-दम
 occurs in the plural in the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 73, 1. where, according to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, xxv. it is probably the proper name of the singers, but by Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 437. is understood as merely an adjective meaning ‘possessed of many houses’ 

पुरुपन्था
पुरु-पन्था
 is mentioned as a generous donor to a Bharadva1ja in one hymn of the Rigveda (vi. 63, 10).

पुरुमाय्य
पुरु-माय्य
 occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 68, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. as a prote4ge4 of Indra. It is quite possible that he was the father of, or at least connected with, Atithigva, R2ks2a, and As4vamedha, who are celebrated in the hymn.

पुरुमित्र
पुरु-मित्र
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda (i. 117, 20; x. 39, 7) as the father of a maiden who wedded Vimada, apparently against her father's will.

पुरुमीळ्ह
पुरु-मीऌह
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda 1) i. 151, 2; 183. 5. as an ancient sage, in which capacity he appears in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 29, 4; xviii. 3, 15. also. Perhaps the same 3) See, however, Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27, n. 3; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 62, n. 3 Purumi1l2ha is intended in an obscure hymn in the Rigveda, 4) v. 61, 9. where, according to the legends reported in the Br2haddevata1 5) v. 49 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. and by S2ad2gurus4is2ya in his commentary on the Sarva1nukraman2i1, 6) Edition Macdonell, pp. 118 et seq. and by Sa1yan2a in his commentary on the Rigveda, 4) v. 61, 9. he as well as Taranta was a son of Vidadas4va, and a patron of the singer S4ya1va1s4va. The correctness of the legend has been shown to be most improbable by Oldenberg, 7) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 353, 354. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 359. who points out 8) Op. cit., 354, n. 1. that the legend misinterprets the Rigveda by making Purumi1l2ha a Vaidadas4vi, for he is there only compared in generosity to one. In another legend found in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 9) xiii. 7, 12. and based on a hymn of the Rigveda, 10) ix. 58, 3. Purumi1l2ha and Taranta appear as persons who received gifts from Dhvasra and Purus2anti, and as sons of Vidadas4va. The legend, which also occurs in the S4a1t2ya1yanaka, 11) Cited by Sa1yan2a on Rv., loc. cit. is apparently best explained by Sieg, 12) Op, cit., 63. who says that as the two were kings they could not under the rules of caste accept gifts, unless for the nonce they became singers. The legend has no claim at all, as Oldenberg 13) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 232, n. 1. He points out, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 354, that the legend is not accepted by the Anukraman2i1 (Index), since its list of authors gives Avatsa1ra as the R2s2i, not the two Taranta and Purumi1l2ha. shows, to validity.

पुरुष
पुरुष,
 or Pu1rus2a, is the generic term for ‘man’ in the Rigveda 1) vii. 104, 15; x. 97. 4. 5. 8; 165, 3. and later. 2) Av. iii. 21, 1; v. 21, 4; viii. 2, 25; 7, 2; xii. 3, 51; 4, 25; xiii. 4, 42, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 1, 5; 2, 2, 8; v. 2, 5, 1, etc. Man is composed of five parts according to the Atharvaveda, 3) xii. 3, 10; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 5, 26; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 14; vi. 29. or of six according to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 4) ii. 39. or of sixteen, 5) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 4, 16. or of twenty, 6) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiii. 14, 5. or of twenty-one, 7) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 8, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 1, 6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 18; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 2, 4, etc. or of twenty-four, 8) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 1, 23. or of twenty-five, 9) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 12, 10; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, i. 1; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 2, 4. all more or less fanciful enumerations. Man is the first of animals, 10) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 1, 18; vii. 5, 2, 17. He is the master of animals, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xx. 10. but also essentially an animal (see Pas4u). The height of a man is given in the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra 11) xvi. 8, 21. 25. as four Aratnis (‘cubits’) , each of two Padas (‘feet’), each of twelve An3gulis (‘finger's breadths’); and the term Purus2a itself is found earlier 12) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 5, 14; xiii. 8, 1, 19; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 5, 1. as a measure of length. Purus2a is also applied to denote the length of a man's life, a ‘generation’; 13) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 5, 5; v. 4, 10, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 3, 6; dvi-purus2a (‘two generations’), Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 7, etc. the ‘pupil’ in the eye; 14) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 5, 2. 7. 8; xii. 9, 1, 12; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 3, 9. and in the grammatical literature the ‘person’ of the verb. 15) Nirukta, vii. 1, 2. 

पुरुषमृग
पुरुष मृग
 the ‘man wild beast,’ occurs in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 15, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 16; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 35. Zimmer's 2) Altindisches Leben, 85. view that the ape is meant seems probable. According to him also, the word Purus2a alone, in two passages of the Atharvaveda, 3) vi. 38, 4; xix. 39, 4. refers to the ape and its cry (ma1yu); but this sense is not necessary, and it is not adopted by Bloomfield, 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda. 117. though Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 309. does not think the rendering ‘cry of a man’ satisfactory, the term ma1yu not being properly applicable to the noise made by human beings.

पुरुषहस्तिन्
पुरुष हस्तिन्
 (‘the man with a hand’) is found in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 29; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 8. It must be the ‘ape.’

पुरुषन्ति
पुरुषन्ति
 is a name that occurs twice in the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 23; ix. 58, 3. in the first passage denoting a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, in the second a patron who gave presents to one of the Vedic singers. In both cases the name is joined with that of Dhvasanti or Dhvasra. The presumption from the manner in which these three names are mentioned is that they designate men, but the grammatical form of the words might equally well be feminine. Females must be meant, if the evidence of the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 7, 12. Roth thinks the feminine form Dhvasre here is a corruption, based on the dual form occurring in the Rigveda, Dhvasrayoh2, which might be feminine as well as masculine. is to be taken as decisive, for the form of the first of the two names there occurring, Dhvasre Purus2anti1, ‘Dhvasra1 and Purus2anti,’ is exclusively feminine, though here as well as elsewhere Sa1yan2a 3) Also on the S4a1t2ya1yanaka, cited on Rv. ix. 58, 3, and on Rv. i. 112, 23. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27, n. 1; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 62, 63; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 232, n. 1. interprets the names as masculines. See also Taranta and Purumi1l2ha. 

पुरुहन्मन्
पुरु-हन्मन्
 is the name of a R2s2i in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 70, an A1n3girasa, according to the Rigvedic Anukraman2i1 (Index), but according to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xiv. 9, 29. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. a Vaikha1nasa.

पुरूरवस्
पुरू-रवस्
 is the name of a hero in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 95. containing a curious dialogue between him and a nymph, Urvas4i1, an Apsaras. He is also mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) xi. 5, 1, 1. Cf. iii. 4, 1, 22; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 10; Nirukta, x. 46. where several verses of the Rigvedic dialogue find a setting in a continuous story. In the later literature he is recognized as a king. 3) See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 283 et seq. His name is perhaps intended in one other passage of the Rigveda. 4) i. 31, 4. It is impossible to say whether he is a mythical figure pure and simple, or really an ancient king. His epithet, Ail2a, 5) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 1, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 196; Max Mu7ller, Chips, 42, 109 et seq.; Kuhn, Die Herabkunft des Feuers, 85 et seq.; Roth, Nirukta, Erla7uterungen, 153; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 124, 135; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 28, 323. ‘descendant of Id2a1’ (a sacrificial goddess), is certainly in favour of the former alternative.

पुरूरु
पुरूरु
 is the name of a poet, an A1treya, in the Rigveda, 1) v. 70, 1. according to Ludwig. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215, n. 1; R2gveda-Noten, 1, 360. But the only form of the word found, puru1run2a1, seems merely an adverb meaning ‘far and wide.’

पुरूवसु
पुरू-वसु
 (‘abounding in wealth’) is the name of a poet, an A1treya, according to Ludwig, 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126. in one passage of the Rigveda. 2) v. 36, 3. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215, n. 1; R2gveda-Noten, 1, 333. But this is very doubtful. 

पुरोडाश्
पुरो-डाश्
 is the name of the sacrificial cake in the Rigveda 1) iii. 28, 2; 41, 3; 52, 2; iv. 24, 5; vi. 23, 7; viii. 31, 2, etc. and later. 2) Av. ix. 6, 12; x. 9, 25; xii. 4, 35; xviii. 4, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 2, 8; vii. 1, 9, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 85; xxviii. 23, etc. Cf.

 denotes the office of Purohita, ‘domestic priest.’ Its mention as early as the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 24, 1. and often later, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 2, 9; vii. 4, 1, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 1, 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 12; 9, 27; xv. 4, 7; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 31; viii. 24, 27; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 4, 5. shows that the post was a fully recognized and usual one.

पुरोनुवाक्या
पुरो-ऽनुवाक्या
 (‘introductory verse to be recited’) is the technical term for the address to a god inviting him to partake of the offering; it was followed by the Ya1jya1, which accompanied the actual oblation. 1) Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 387, 388. Such addresses are not unknown, but are rare, according to Oldenberg, 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 243 et seq., against Bergaigne, Recherches surl'llistoire de la liturgie ve4dique, 13 et seq. in the Rigveda; subsequently they are regular, the word itself occurring in the later Sam2hita1s 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 10, 4; ii. 2, 9, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 12, etc. and the Bra1hman2as. 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 17; ii. 13, 26; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 1, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 2, 21, etc.

पुरोरुच्
पुरो-रुच्
 is the technical description of certain Nivid verses which were recited at the morning libation in the A1jya and Prau7ga ceremonies before the hymn (su1kta) of the litany or its parts. It occurs in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 10, 13; vii. 2, 7, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 39; iii. 9; iv. 5; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 4, 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 3, 15; 2, 1, 8; v. 4, 4, 20, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 102. 

पुरोवात
पुरो-वात,
 the ‘east wind,’ is mentioned in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 11, 3; ii. 4, 7, 1; iv. 3, 3, 1; 4, 6, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 2, 18; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, ii. 3, 1, etc. Geldner 2) Vedische Studien, 3, 120, n. 2. thinks it merely means the wind preceding the rains.

पुरोहित
पुरो-हित
 (‘placed in front,’ ‘appointed’) is the name of a priest in the Rigveda 1) i. 1, 1; 44, 10. 12; ii. 24, 9; iii. 2, 8; 3, 2; v. 11, 2; vi. 70, 4, etc. and later. 2) Av. viii. 5, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 23; xi. 81; xxxi. 20; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 24, etc.; Nirukta, ii. 12; vii. 15. The office of Purohita is called Purohiti 3) Rv. vii. 60, 12; 83, 4. and Purodha1. It is clear that the primary function of the Purohita was that of ‘domestic priest’ of a king, or perhaps a great noble; his quite exceptional position is shown by the fact that only one Purohita seems ever to be mentioned in Vedic literature. 4) Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 144, thinks that several Purohitas were possible, quoting Sa1yan2a, on Rv. x. 57, 1, who gives the tale of the Gaupa1yanas and King Asama1ti from the S4a1t2ya1yanaka, and comparing the case of Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra as Purohitas, probably contemporaneously, of Suda1s. But that the two were contemporaneous is most unlikely, especially if we adopt the very probable view of Hopkins (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260 et seq.) that Vis4va1mitra was with the ten kings (Rv. vii. 18) when they unsuccessfully attacked Suda1s. The other narrative has, as Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 375, n. 3, observes, a markedly fictitious character; while every other passage that mentions a Purohita speaks of him in the singular, and as there was only one Brahman priest at the sacrifice, so the Purohita acted as Brahman. Examples of Purohitas in the Rigveda are Vis4va1mitra 5) iii. 33. 53. Cf. vii. 18. or Vasis2t2ha 6) Rv. vii. 18. 83. in the service of the Bharata king; Suda1s, of the Tr2tsu family; the Purohita of Kurus4ravan2a; 7) Rv. x. 33. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 150, 184. and Deva1pi, the Purohita of S4antanu. 8) Rv. x. 98. The Purohita was in all religious matters the alter ego of the king. In the ritual 9) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 24. it is laid down that a king must have a Purohita, else the gods will not accept his offerings. He ensures the king's safety and victory in battle by his prayers; 10) See Av. iii. 19; Rv. vii. 18, 13, from which Geldner, op. cit., 2, 135, n. 3, concludes that the priest prayed in the Sabha1, ‘house of assembly,’ while the king fought on the field of battle. See A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 12. 19. 20. Cf. Pu1ru, n. 2. he procures the fall of rain for the crops; 11) Rv. x. 98. he is the flaming fire that guards the kingdom. 12) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 24. 25. Divoda1sa in trouble is rescued by Bharadva1ja; 13) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xv. 3, 7. and King Tryarun2a Traidha1tva Aiks2va1ka reproaches his Purohita, Vr2s4a Ja1na, when his car runs over a Brahmin boy and kills him. 14) Ibid., xiii. 3, 12. See Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 64, et seq. The close relation of king and Purohita is illustrated by the case of Kutsa Aurava, who slew his Purohita, Upagu Saus4ravasa, for disloyalty in serving Indra, to whom Kutsa was hostile. 15) Ibid., xiv. 6, 8. Other disputes between kings and priests who officiated for them are those of Janamejaya and the Kas4yapas, and of Vis4vantara and the S4ya1parn2as; 16) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 27. 35. and between Asama1ti and the Gaupa1yanas. 17) See S4a1t2ya1yanaka, cited by Sa1yan2a, on Rv. x. 57, 1; and cf. Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 167 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 41). In some cases one Purohita served more than one king; for example, Devabha1ga S4rautars2a was the Purohita of the Kurus and the Sr2n3jayas at the same time, 18) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 4, 5. According to Sa1yan2a, on Rv. i. 81, 3. is was Ra1hu1gan2a Gotama who was Purohita; but this is hardly more than a mere blunder. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 152; Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 9, n. and Jala Ja1tu1karn2ya was the Purohita of the kings of Ka1s4i, Videha, and Kosala. 19) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 29, 5. There is no certain proof that the office of Purohita was hereditary in a family, though it probably was so. 20) See Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 375, who compares the permanent character of the relation of the king and the Purohita with that of husband and wife, as shown in the ritual laid down in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 27. At any rate, it seems clear from the relations of the Purohita with King Kurus4ravan2a, and with his son Upamas4ravas, 21) See Rv. x. 33, and n. 7. that a king would keep on the Purohita of his father. Zimmer 22) Altindisches Leben, 195, 196. thinks that the king might act as his own Purohita, as shown by the case of King Vis4vantara, who sacrificed without the help of the S4ya1parn2as, 23) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 27; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 436-440. and that a Purohita need not be a priest, as shown by the case of Deva1pi and S4antanu. 24) Rv. x. 98. But neither opinion seems to be justified. It is not said that Vis4vantara sacrificed without priests, while Deva1pi is not regarded as a king until the Nirukta, 25) ii. 10. and there is no reason to suppose that Ya1ska's view expressed in that work is correct. According to Geldner, 26) Op. cit., 2, 144; 3, 155. Cf. Pischel, Go7ttingisehe Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1894, 420; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 13. Rv. i. 94, 6, does not prove that the Purohita was a R2tvij: it merely shows that he could be one when he wished. the Purohita from the beginning acted as the Brahman priest in the sacrificial ritual, being there the general superintendent of the sacrifice. In favour of this view, he cites the fact that Vasis2t2ha is mentioned both as Purohita 27) Rv. x. 150, 5. and as Brahman: 28) Rv. vii. 33, 11. But this need mean no more than Brahmin. at the sacrifice of S4unah2s4epa he served as Brahman, 29) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 16, 1; Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xv. 21, 4. but he was the Purohita of Suda1s; 30) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 11 14. Br2haspati is called the Purohita 31) Rv. ii. 24, 9; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 17, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 1, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 2; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiv. 23, 1 and the Brahman 32) Rv. x. 141, 3; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, vi. 13; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 4, 21; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 6, 9. of the gods; and the Vasis2t2has who are Purohitas are also the Brahmans at the sacrifice. 33) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 2, 1. This point is not in the parallel versions, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 17 (but cf. xxvii. 4: brahma-purohitam2 ks2atram, unless this means ‘the Ks2atra is inferior to the Brahma’); Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xv. 5, 24, and cf. Gopatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 13. The Atharvan literature (Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, lx, lxi) requires a follower of that Veda to act as Brahman, and the spells of the Atharvan are, in fact, closely allied to the spells of the Purohita as represented in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 24-28. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 193, 195. It is thus clear that the Brahman was often the Purohita; and it was natural that this should be the case when once the Brahman's place became, as it did in the later ritual, the most important position at the sacrifice. 34) See Bloomfield, op. cit., lviii, lxii, lxv, lxviii et seq. But the Brahman can hardly be said to have held this place in the earlier ritual; Oldenberg 35) Religion des Veda, 380, 381. seems to be right in holding that the Purohita was originally the Hotr2 priest, the singer par excellence, when he took any part at all in the ritual of the great sacrifices with the R2tvijs. So Deva1pi seems clearly to have been a Hotr2; 36) Rv. x. 98; and cf. Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 6, 8; A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 12, 7. Agni is at once Purohita 37) Rv. i. 1, 1; iii. 3, 2; 11, 1; v. 11, 2. In viii. 27, 1; x. 1, 6, he is called Purohita, and credited with the characteristic activities of the Hotr2 priest. and Hotr2; 38) Rv. i. 1, 1; iii. 3, 2; 11, 1; v. 11, 2. etc. and the ‘two divine Hotr2s’ referred to in the A1pri1 litanies are also called the ‘two Purohitas.’ 39) Rv. x. 66, 13; 70, 7. Later, no doubt, when the priestly activity ceased to centre in the song, the Purohita, with his skill in magic, became the Brahman, who also required magic to undo the errors of the sacrifice. 40) Cf. Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 26. There is little doubt that in the original growth of the priesthood the Purohita played a considerable part. In historical times he represented the real power of the kingship, and may safely be deemed to have exercised great influence in all public affairs, such as the administration of justice and the king's conduct of business. But it is not at all probable that the Purohita represents, as Roth 41) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 117 et seq. and Zimmer 42) Altindisches Leben, 195. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 168, 169; 195 et seq.; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 485; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 31-35; 138; Haug, Brahma und die Brahmanen, 9 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 144; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 374-383; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, lxx et seq. thought, the source which gave rise to caste. The priestly class is already in existence in the Rigveda (see Varn2a).

 (‘descendant of Pra1ci1nayoga’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Dr2ti Aindroti S4aunaka, in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 40, 2). He taught Paulus2i Satyayajn5a.

पुष्कर
पुष्कर
 is the name in the Rigveda 1) vi. 16, 13; vii. 33, 11, may be so taken, though Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3, and Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 112, prefer to see in these passages a reference to the bowl of the sacrificial ladle. and later 2) Av. xi. 3, 8; xii. 1, 24; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 4, 1; 2, 6, 5; 6, 4, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 29; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 1, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 1, 16; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 5. of the blue lotus flower. The Atharvaveda 3) Av. xii. 1, 24. mentions its sweet perfume. The lotus grew in lakes, which were thence called pus2karin2i1, ‘lotus-bearing.’ 4) Rv. v. 78, 7; x. 107, 10; Av. iv. 34, 5; v. 16, 17; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 11, etc. That the flower was early used for personal adornment is shown by an epithet of the As4vins, ‘lotuscrowned’ (pus2kara-sraj). 5) Rv. x. 184, 2; Av. iii. 22, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 16, etc. Presumably because of its likeness in shape to the flower of the lotus, the bowl of the ladle is called Pus2kara, perhaps already in the Rigveda, 6) Rv. viii 72, 11, where the sense is doubtful, and the bowl of the ladle is not particularly appropriate. See also note 1. and certainly in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 7) vii. 5. Moreover, according to the Nirukta, 8) v. 14. Pus2kara means ‘water,’ a sense actually found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 9) vi. 4, 2, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71.

पुष्करसाद
पुष्कर-साद,
 ‘sitting on the lotus,’ is the name of an animal in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 5. It can hardly be a ‘snake,’ 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95, so takes it. but rather either, as Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks, a ‘bird,’ or perhaps, according to the commentator on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 5. a ‘bee.’

पूतक्रता
पूत-क्रता
 is the name of a woman in a Va1lakhilya hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 64, 4. perhaps the wife of Pu1takratu, but this is doubtful, since the more regular form would be Pu1takrata1yi1, 2) Pa1n2ini, iv. 1, 36. which Scheftelowitz 3) Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 41, 42. reads in the hymn.

पूतक्रतु
पूत-क्रतु
 (‘of clear insight’) is the name of a patron in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 68, 17. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 41, reads Pu1takratu for Pautakrata in Rv. viii. 56, 2, but this is improbable. See Oldenberg, Go7ttingische Gelekrte Anzeigen, 1907, 237, 238; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 39, n. 4. apparently the son of As4vamedha. 

पूतिरज्जु
पूति-रज्जु
 is the name of a certain plant of unknown kind in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 8, 2. according to Roth. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The Kaus4ika Su1tra 3) xvi. 10. treats it as a ‘putrid rope,’ but Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 527. Cf. Whitney's Translation of the Rigveda, 503; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 583. suggests that a snake is meant.

पूतीक
पूतीक
 is the name of a plant often mentioned 1) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 3 (pu1tika,  as quoted in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 2, 12. Cf. iv. 5, 10, 4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, viii. 4, 1; ix. 5, 3, etc. as a substitute for the Soma plant. It is also given in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 2) ii. 5, 3, 5. as a means of making milk curdle, being an alternative to the bark of the Butea frondosa (parn2a-valka). It is usually identified with the Guilandina Bonduc, but Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 24, n. 3. Cf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 35, 689; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63, 276. makes it out to be the Basella Cordifolia.

पूतुद्रु
पूतु-द्रु
 is another name for the Deodar (deva-da1ru) in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 2, 28. and the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 8, 4 (in 6 the fruit is meant); Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 8, 5. The longer form, Pu1tu-da1ru, is found in the Kaus4ika Su1tra. 3) viii. 15; lviii. 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59.

पूरु
पूरु
 is the name of a people and their king in the Rigveda. They are mentioned with the Anus, Druhyus, Turvas4as, and Yadus in one passage. 1) i. 108. 8. They also occur as enemies of the Tr2tsus in the hymn of Suda1s’ victory. 2) vii. 18, 13. Cf. Turvas4a. Apparently, as Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 263, n., and Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 135, think, in this verse the words jes2ma Pu1rum2 vidathe mr2dhrava1cam refer to the Pu1ru king and to the priest Vis4va1mitra, who prayed for the defeat of Suda1s, though in vain. Hopkins seems to take the words vidathe mr2dhrava1cam generally as ‘the false speaker in the assembly’; but, according to Geldner, the meaning intended is that, while the king fought, the Purohita prayed in the Sabha1, or meeting house of the people. In another hymn 3) Rv. vii. 8, 4. Agni of the Bharatas is celebrated as victorious over the Pu1rus, probably a reference to the same decisive overthrow. On the other hand, victories of the Pu1rus over the aborigines seem to be referred to in several passages. 4) i. 59, 6; 131, 4; 174, 2; iv. 21, 10; 38, 1; vi. 20, 10; vii. 5, 3; 19, 3. Cf. note 13. The great kings of the Pu1rus were Purukutsa and his son Trasadasyu, whose name bears testimony to his prowess against aboriginal foes, while a later prince was Tr2ks2i Tra1sadasyava. In the Rigveda the Pu1rus are expressly 5) vii. 96, 2. Perhaps they are also meant as living on the S4aryan2a1vant in Rv. viii. 64, 10. 11. mentioned as on the Sarasvati1. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 124. thinks that the Sindhu (Indus) is meant in this passage. But Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 175. and Hillebrandt 8) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 50, 115; 3, 374. with much greater probability think that the eastern Sarasvati1 in Kuruks2etra is meant. This view accords well with the sudden disappearance of the name of the Pu1rus from Vedic tradition, a disappearance accounted for by Oldenberg's 9) Buddha, 404. Cf. Ludwig, 3, 205. conjecture that the Pu1rus became part of the great Kuru people, just as Turvas4a and Krivi disappear from the tradition on their being merged in the Pan5ca1la nation. Tra1sadasyava, the patronymic of Kurus4ravan2a in the Rigveda, 10) x. 33, 4. shows that the royal families of the Kurus and the Pu1rus were allied by intermarriage. Hillebrandt, 11) Op. cit., 1, 114 et seq. admitting that the Pu1rus in later times lived in the eastern country round the Sarasvati1, thinks that in earlier days they were to be found to the west of the Indus with Divoda1sa. This theory must fall with the theory that Divoda1sa was in the far west. It might, however, be held to be supported by the fact that Alexander found a --that is, a Paurava prince on the Hydaspes, 12) Arrian, Indica, viii. 4; ix. 1; xix. 3, etc. See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 132, 133. a sort of half-way locality between the Sarasvati1 and the West. But it is quite simple to suppose either that the Hydaspes was the earlier home of the Pu1rus, where some remained after the others had wandered east, or that the later Paurava represents a successful onslaught upon the west from the east. In several other passages of the Rigveda 13) In Rv. i. 36, 1, Pu1ru1n2a1m might be read for puru1n2a1m, with improvement in the sense. In i. 63, 7, there is a reference to the Pu1ru king, Purukutsa, and Suda1s, but in what relation is uncertain (see Purukutsa). In i. 130, 7. the Pu1ru king and Divoda1sa Atithigva are both mentioned, apparently as victorious over aboriginal foes. See also i. 129, 5; iv. 39, 2; v. 17, 1; vi. 46, 8; x. 4, 1; 48, 5. the Pu1rus as a people seem to be meant. The Nirukta 14) vii. 23; Naighan2t2uka, ii. 3. recognizes the general sense of ‘man,’ but in no passage is this really necessary or even probable. So utterly, however, is the tradition lost that the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 15) vi. 8, 1, 14. explains Pu1ru in the Rigveda 16) vii. 8, 4. as an Asura Raks2as; it is only in the Epic that Pu1ru revives as the name of a son of Yaya1ti and S4armis2t2ha1. 17) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 26, etc. Cf.

 has in several passages 1) Rv. vi. 39, 5 (cf., however, Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 43); x. 97, 4; Av. iv. 9, 7; x. 1, 17; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 3, 1, 22, etc. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 383. the sense of ‘menial’ or ‘dependent,’ like the English ‘man.’

पूर्णमास
पूर्ण-मास
 denotes the full moon and the festival of that day, occurring frequently in the later Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 7, 2; ii. 2, 10, 2; 5, 4, 1; iii. 4, 4, 1; vii. 4, 8, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 1, 14; iii. 5, 7, 13; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 2, 4, 8, etc. Cf. Ma1sa.

Cf. Daks2in2a1.

पूर्पति
पूर्-पति,
 ‘lord of the fort,’ occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) i. 173. 10. is of somewhat doubtful interpretation. The term may denote a regular office, 2) Cf. Sa1yan2a's note, on Rv. i. 173, 10; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 456. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204. similar to that of the Gra1man2i1: the Pur would then be a permanently occupied settlement. The expression may, however, merely mean the chief over a fort when it was actually occupied against hostile attack. The rarity of the word seems to favour the latter sense.

पूर्वपक्ष
पूर्व-पक्ष
 denotes the first half of the month. See Ma1sa.

पूर्ववयस
पूर्व-वयस,
 the ‘first period of life,’ is a term used in the Bra1hman2as 1) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xix. 4, 3; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 2, 3, 4; 9, 1, 8; pu1rva-vayasin, Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 13, 3. Cf. Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 3, 3, where vatsa and tr2ti1ya, ‘the third (stage),’ are used to cover ‘youth’ and ‘old age,’ as opposed to manhood, when the knowledge of the doctrines of the A1ran2yaka is to be imparted. to denote ‘youth.’

पूर्ववह्
पूर्व-वह्
 is a term applied to the horse (As4va) in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 1) i. 1, 5, 6 and elsewhere. 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 4, 17; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 3. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. It may either refer to a horse fastened in front as a ‘leader,’ or merely mean ‘drawing (a chariot) for the first time,’ as understood by the commentator on the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a.

पूर्वाह्ण
पूर्वाह्ण,
 ‘the earlier (part of the) day,’ ‘forenoon,’ is a common designation of time from the Rigveda 1) x. 34, 11. onwards. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 20; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 12; iii. 4. 4, 2; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 11, 7; Nirukta, viii. 9, etc. Cf. Ahan.

पूल्य
पूल्य,
 or Pu1lpa, in the Atharvaveda 1) xiv. 2, 63. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 765. seems to mean ‘shrivelled grain’ (cf. La1ja1). 

पृक्ष
पृक्ष
 (literally, perhaps ‘swift’) is the proper name of a man in an obscure verse of the Rigveda. 1) ii. 13, 8. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 97.

पृक्षयाम
पृक्ष-याम
 occurs once in the plural in the Rigveda. 1) i. 122, 7. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. suggests the sense of ‘faring with swift steeds,’ and thinks a proper name is meant. Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 97, 98. holds that the word is an epithet of the Pajras, and that it means ‘performing splendid sacrifices.’

 1) Only in the locative, Rv. ii. 27, 15; 26, 1; iii. 49, 3; vi. 20, 1, etc.; pr2tsus2n, i. 129, 4 (with double case-ending). and Pr2tana1 2) Rv. i. 85, 8; 91, 21; 119, 10; 152. 7; ii. 40, 5; iii. 24, 1; vi. 41, 5; x. 29, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 76; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xv. 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 1, 6; 2, 6, etc. denote, in the Rigveda and later, ‘contest,’ whether in arms or in the chariot race. Pr2tana1 has also the concrete sense of ‘army’ in some passages; 3) Rv. vii. 20, 3; viii. 36, 1; 37, 2; Av. vi. 97, 1; viii. 5, 8; Nirukta, ix. 24; perhaps also as neuter in Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 7, 5. in the Epic system 4) Maha1bha1rata, i. 291. it denotes a definite body of men, elephants, chariots, and horses.

पृथ
पृथ,
 the ‘palm’ of the hand in the sense of its breath, is used as a measure of length in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a1. 1) i. 6, 4, 2, 3; cf. Ka1tya1yana S4raut2a Su1tra, vi. 1, 28; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 2, 7; viii. 5, 10.

पृथवान

 is in the Rigveda 1) x. 93, 14. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 433. the name of a man, perhaps also called Duh2s4i1ma, but this is uncertain. Cf. Pr2thi.

Venya mentioned with Pr2thi1 in Rv. x. 148, 5, may be meant for his patronymic (= Vainya): cf. Tugrya, n. 1. or Pr2thu 3) Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 186 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 125); Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 10, 9; 34, 6; 45, 1. is the name of a semi-mythical personage who is mentioned in the Rigveda and later as a R2s2i, and more specially as the inventor of agriculture 4) Av., loc. cit. and the lord of both worlds, of men and of animals. 5) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. Cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 5, 1. He bears in several passages 6) See notes 1-3. the epithet Vainya, ‘descendant of Vena,’ and must probably be regarded as a culture hero rather than as a real man. According to other accounts, 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, loc. cit.; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, loc. cit.; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 7, 4. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 221, 222; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 50, n. 2; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 134. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 81, gives the name as Pr2thin Vainya; but the oblique cases, when found, are all in favour of Pr2thi or Pr2thi1 as the stem. he was the first of consecrated kings. Cf. Pa1rthiva.

पृथिवी
पृथिवी
 denotes the ‘earth’ as the ‘broad’ one in the Rigveda 1) Rv. vii. 7, 2, 5; 99, 3; v. 85, 1, 5; viii. 89, 5, etc. and later, 2) Av. xii. 1, 1 et seq.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 53, etc. being often personified as a deity 3) Rv. iv. 3, 5; 51, 11; v. 49, 5; 84, 1 et seq.; vi. 50, 13, 14; vii. 34, 23, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 103, etc. both alone and with Div, ‘heaven,’ as Dya1va1-Pr2thivi1. 4) Rv. iv. 56, 1; vii. 53, 1, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 20, 21, 123, 126. Mention is often made of three earths, 5) Rv. i. 34, 8; iv. 53, 5; vii. 104, 11; Av. iv. 20, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, v. 9, etc. of which the world on which we live is the highest. 6) Av. vi. 21, 1; xix. 27, 3; 32, 4; 53, 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 1, 31; v. 1, 5, 21. The earth is girdled by the ocean, according to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 7) viii. 20. This idea is not found in the Sam2hita1s, Macdonell, op. cit., p. 9. The Nirukta 8) ix. 31; xi. 36; xii. 30; Naighan2t2uka, v. 3, 5, 6. Cf. Bruce, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 19, 321 et seq. places one of the three earths in each of the worlds into which the universe is divided (see Div). In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 9) xiv. 1, 2, 10. the earth is called the ‘firstborn of being,’ and its riches (vitta) are referred to; 10) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 6, 3. hence in a late passage of the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 11) xiii. 1. the earth is styled vasu-mati1, ‘full of wealth.’ The word also occurs in the Rigveda, 12) vi. 12, 5; x. 187, 2. Cf. Macdonell, op. cit., 34. though rarely, in the form of Pr2thvi1. 13) The regular adjectival feminine form of pr2thu, ‘broad.’

पृथु
पृथु
 See Pr2thi. Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 196 et seq. also finds a mention of the Pr2thus as a tribe, allied with the Pars4us, in one passage of the Rigveda 2) vii. 83, 1. as opponents of the Tr2tsu Bharatas. But this interpretation is certainly incorrect. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 134 et seq.; 433, 434; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 184, n. 3; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 362, n. See Pars4u.

पृथुश्रवस्
1. Pr2thu-s4ravas (‘far-famed’) is mentioned in connexion with Vas4a in two hymns 1) i. 116, 21; viii. 46, 21. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. of the Rigveda. In the second passage the generosity of Pr2thus4ravas Ka1ni1ta to Vas4a As4vya is celebrated, and the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xvi. 11, 13. refers to the episode.

पृथुश्रवस्दौरेश्रवस
2. Pr2thu-s4ravas Daure-s4ravasa (‘descendant of Du1res4ravas’) is the name of the Udga1tr2 priest at the snake festival mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

पृदाकु
पृदाकु,
 the name of a ‘snake’ in the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 27, 1; iii. 27, 3; vi. 38, 1; vii. 56, 1; x. 4, 11 et seq.; xii. 3, 57. is mentioned in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 10, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 33. and occasionally else where. 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vi. 12; Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 27. Its skin was specially valuable, according to the Atharvaveda. 4) i. 27. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94.

पृदाकुसानु
पृदाकु-सानु,
 ‘having the surface of a snake,’ is taken by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161. and Griffith 2) Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 141. as the name of the institutor of a sacrifice in one hymn of the Rigveda. 3) viii. 17, 15.

पृशन
पृशन
 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) ix. 97, 54. is considered by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 16. to denote a place where a battle was fought.

पृश्निगु
1. Pr2s4ni-gu is the name of a man who is mentioned with Purukutsa and S4ucanti as a prote4ge4 of the As4vins in one hymn of the Rigveda (i. 112, 7). Possibly the word is only an epithet of Purukutsa. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 114.

पृश्निगु
2. Pr2s4ni-gu, pl., is taken in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 10. by Geldner 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 114. as denoting the name of a people. But this is not probable.

पृश्निपर्णी
पृश्नि-पर्णी
 (‘having a speckled leaf’) is the name of a plant mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 25, 1 et seq. as a protection against evil beings procuring abortion, called Kan2vas (presumably a sign of hostility to the Kan2va family). 2) Cf. Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 65; Bergaigne, Religion Ve4dique, 2, 465; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 207. It also appears in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) xiii. 8, 1, 10. being identified with Hermionitis cordifolia by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, but Roth 4) Cited by Whitney, loc. cit. in a subsequent contribution suggests that it is the same as a plant later called laks2man2a1, and regarded as curing barrenness. The scholiast on the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra 5) xxv. 7, 17. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 187; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 302. thinks that the Glycine debilis is meant.

पृषत
पृषत
 is the name of an animal mentioned in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 9. 21; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 27. 40. The dappled antelope or gazelle seems to be meant. 2) Nirukta, ii. 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83.

पृषती
पृषती
 in some passages 1) Rv. viii. 64, 10. 11, where ‘deer’ is nonsense, and ‘mares’ is improbable. The regular donation is ‘cows’; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 2, 9 (see Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 125); Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 2 (though this is not certain); S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 14, 23, etc. clearly means a ‘speckled’ cow. The term is, however, generally 2) Rv. i. 37, 2; 39, 6; 64, 8; 85, 4, 5; ii. 34, 3; 36, 2; iii. 26, 4; v. 55, 6; 58, 6; 60, 2; i. 162, 21. applied to the team of the Maruts, when its sense is doubtful. The commentators usually explain it as ‘speckled antelope.’ But Mahi1dhara, 3) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 16. followed by Roth, 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. He had earlier (ibid., 1, 1091) been inclined to follow the usual interpretation given by Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 37, 2, etc., which Benfey, Orient und Occident, 2, 250, accepted. prefers to see in it a ‘dappled mare’: it is true that the Maruts are often called 5) Rv. i. 87, 4; 89, 7; 186, 8; ii. 34, 4; iii. 26, 6; v. 42, 15; vii. 40, 3 pr2s2ad-as4va, which is more naturally interpreted as ‘having dappled steeds,’ than as ‘having Pr2s2ati1s as steeds.’ 6) So Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 87, 4. This view is far-fetched, but is supported, in so far as the interpretation of Pr2s2ati1 and As4va is concerned, by such passages as v. 55, 6, where the Maruts are said to yoke the Pr2s2ati1s as as4va1n to their chariots; but the sense may be ‘horses (and) dappled (mares).’ See, however, Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 226. In the later literature, which Grassmann 7) Wo7rterbuch, s.v. prefers to follow, the word means the female of the dappled gazelle. Aufrecht 8) See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 152. concurs in the view of Roth, but Max Mu7ller 9) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 70; 184. is inclined to accept the traditional interpretation, while Muir 10) Op. cit., 5, 151, 152. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83. leaves the matter open.

पृषदाज्य
पृषद्-आज्य
 denotes ‘sprinkled butter’--that is, butter (A1jya) mixed with sour milk, in the Rigveda 1) x. 90, 8. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 6, 2; vi. 3, 9, 6; 11, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 2, 41; 4, 2; iii. 8, 4, 8, etc. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 404, n. 1.

पृषध्र
पृषध्र
 occurs in a Va1lakhilya hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 52, 2. as the name of a man. He is also mentioned in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xvi. 11, 25-27. as a patron of Praskan2va, and called Pr2s2adhra Medhya Ma1taris4van (or Ma1taris4va); but for once there is a discrepancy between the statement of the Su1tra and the text of the Rigveda, for the hymns 3) viii. 55. 56. there attributed to Praskan2va as in praise of Pr2s2adhra have nothing in them connected with Pr2s2adhra, while the Anukraman2i1 (Index) ascribes to Pr2s2adhra himself the authorship of one of them. 4) viii. 56. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 39. On the other hand, Medhya and Ma1taris4van appear as separate persons in the Rigveda 1) viii. 52, 2. along with Pr2s2adhra.

पृषातक
पृषातक
 is the name of a mixture like Pr2s2ada1jya, and consisting, according to the late Gr2hyasam2graha, 1) ii. 59. of curds (Dadhi), honey (Madhu), and Ajya. It is mentioned in a late passage of the Atharvaveda 2) xx. 134, 2. and in the Su1tras. 3) Ma1nava Gr2hya Su1tra, ii. 3, etc. Cf. Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 35, 580.

पृष्ट्या
पृष्ट्या
 1) So Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. Pr2s2t2hya1 is read in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. See, however, Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 169; Bloomfield; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 513. denotes in the Atharvaveda (vi. 102, 2) the side horse (mare). 

पृष्ट्यामय
पृष्ट्य्-आमय
 denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) xix. 34, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 65, 391. a pain in the sides or ribs. 2) The derivative adjective Pr2n2t2ya1mayin, ‘suffering from a pain in the side,’ occurs in Rv. i. 105, 18. It appears to be mentioned there merely as an accompaniment of fever (Takman).

पेत्व
पेत्व
 is found twice in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 4, 8; v. 19, 2. In the first passage reference is made to its va1ja, which Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 229, 230. argues can only mean ‘strength,’ ‘swiftness,’ though naturally the sense of ‘male power’ would seem more appropriate in a spell intended to remove lack of virility. In the second passage the Petva is mentioned as overcoming the horse (see Ubhaya1dant), a miracle which has a parallel in the Rigveda, 3) vii. 18, 17. where the Petva overcomes the female 4) Sim2hyam in the text. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 264, takes it as masculine, and as a play on s4im2yum, the name of one of the kings or peoples defeated in the battle of the ten kings. But, admitting the play, sim2hi1 as fem. seems to be still more pointed than sim2ha, contrasting with the masculine petva. lion. The animal also occurs in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 22; 1. Though not in the parallel passage of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, it appears to be found in the Ka1t2haka, according to Weber's note in his edition of the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. and occasionally elsewhere. 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 8, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxix. 58. 59; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 5, 3. etc. It appears to be the ‘ram’ or the ‘wether,’ the latter 7) Galita-retasko mes2ah2. being the sense given to it by the commentator on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. But there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this meaning, while on the whole the passage of the Atharvaveda, in which va1ja is found, accords best with the sense of ‘ram.’ Hopkins, 8) Loc. cit.; India, Old and New, 58. He thinks the born of the goat pierced the lion. Curiously enough, Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 253. renders the word a ‘goat’ in Av. v. 19, 2, but (p. 151) as ‘ram’ in iv. 4, 8; and Bloomfield Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 434, speaks Both of a ‘ram’ and a ‘goat’ in connexion with v. 19, 2. however, renders the word as ‘goat,’ though for what reason is not clear. Whether it is connected in any way with Pitva or Pidva is quite uncertain. 

पेदु
पेदु
 is the name in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 117, 9; 118, 9; 119, 10; vii. 71, 5; x. 39, 10. of a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, who gave him, in order, as it seems, to replace a bad steed, a mythical horse, hence called Paidva, 2) Rv. ix. 88, 4; Av. x. 4, 5 et seq. which probably represents the horse of the sun. 3) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 52, 149.

पेरुक

 denotes in the Rigveda 1) ii. 3, 6; iv. 36, 7; vii. 34, 11; 42, 1. and later 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 82. 89; xx. 40; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 19, etc. an embroidered garment such as a female dancer would wear. 3) Rv. i. 92, 4. 5. The fondness of the Indians for such raiment is noted by Megasthenes 4) See S¤trabo, p. 509, where he refers to a . and by Arrian, 5) Indica, 5, 9. who refer to their . So in one passage 6) Rv. x. 1, 6. a garment (vastra) is called pes4ana, with which Roth 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. happily compares the Roman vestis coloribus intexta. The making of such garments was a regular occupation of women, as is indicated by the Pes4as-ka1ri1, the ‘female embroiderer,’ figuring in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 8) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 5, 1. though the, commentator on the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a interprets the word as ‘wife of a maker of gold.’ 9) Cf. perhaps suvarn2am2 hiran2yam2 pes4alam in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 5, where pes4ala probably refers to cunningly-worked gold. But this does not suit the compound pes4as-ka1ri1, which must denote a ‘maker of pes4as,’ and pes4as has not the sense of wrought gold in any passage. Cf. also Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 4, 5; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 261. Pischel, 10) Vedische Studien, 2, 113-125. however, thinks that Pes4as never means anything but colour or form.

पेसितृ
पेसितृ
 is the name of one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 12; Taittiri1ya Br2a1hman2a, iii. 4, 8, 1. The sense is quite uncertain. The word is rendered by the St. Petersburg Dictionary and by Weber 2) Indische Streifen, 1, 75, n. 5. as ‘one who cuts in pieces,’ a ‘carver,’ but Sa1yan2a 3) On Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. thinks that it means one who causes an enmity which has been lulled to rest to break out again.

पैङ्गराज
पैङ्ग-राज
 is the name of one of the victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 13, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 16; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 34. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. That a bird is meant is certain, but what particular kind is quite unknown.

पैङ्गीपुत्र
पैङ्गी-पुत्र
 (‘son of a female descendant of Pin3ga’) is the name of a teacher, pupil of S4aunaki1putra, in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 4, 30 Ma1dhyam2dina).

पैङ्ग्य
पैङ्ग्य,
 ‘descendant of Pin3ga,’ is the name of a teacher who is repeatedly mentioned as an authority in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, 1) viii. 9; xvi. 9; xxvi. 3, 4, 14; xxviii. 7. 9; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, ii. 2. where 2) iii. 1; xix. 9; xxiv. 4. Cf. Pain3gi1 sam2pad, xxv. 7. Pain3gya is found also in the Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, iv. 2, 11; xi. 11, 5; 14, 9; xv. 3, 1; xvii. 7, 1, 3; 10, 3; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 11. also his doctrine is called the Pain3gya. This teacher is further referred to in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) xii. 2, 2, 4; 4, 8. (Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 17.) which also speaks of Madhuka Pain3gya. 4) xi. 7, 2, 8; 16. It is, of course, impossible to say whether there was only one Pain3gya or several Pain3gyas. The followers of Pain3gya are called Pain3gins in the Nida1na 5) iv. 7. and Anupada 6) i. 8; ii. 2, 4, 10; vi. 7; xi. 8. Su1tras. His text-book is called Pain3ga in the Anupada Su1tra, 7) ii. 4; iii. 12; iv. 5. while the A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra 8) v. 15, 8; 29, 4. mentions a Pain3ga1yani Bra1hman2a. It is clear that Pain3gya was a teacher of a Rigveda school allied to the Kaus2i1takis. Pain3gi is a patronymic of Ya1ska in the Anukramani1 of the A1treyi1 S4a1kha1. 9) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 71, n.; 3, 396. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44, 45, 404 et seq.; 2, 295; Indian Literature, 41, 46, 47, 56, 81, 90, 130, etc. 

पैजवन
पैजवन,
 ‘descendant of Pijavana,’ is the patronymic of Suda1s. 1) Rv. vii. 18, 22. 25; Nirukta, ii. 24. 25; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 34; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 11, 14. It seems most probable that Pijavana intervened in the line of succession between Divoda1sa and Suda1s, because the two kings have, according to tradition, quite different Purohitas, the former being served by the Bharadva1jas as his priests, the latter by Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra; 2) See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie 1, 104 et seq. this is more natural if they were divided by a period of time than if they had been, as is usually supposed, father and son. Geldner, 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 115. however, identifies Divoda1sa and Pijavana.

पैद्व
पैद्व
 See Pedu.

पोतृ
पोतृ
 is the name of one of the priests (R2tvij) of the sacrificial ritual. Already known to the Rigveda, 1) i. 94, 6; ii. 5, 2; iv. 9, 3; vii. 16, 5; ix. 67, 22. he is frequently mentioned later in the Bra1hman2as. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 10 et seq.; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 4, 22; v. 4, 5, 22; xii. 1, 1, 8, etc. But as Oldenberg 3) Religien des Veda, 383, 391, 395. observes, the Potr2 is not in the later literature a priest of any importance, but is practically a mere name. Judging by the derivation of the name from the root pu1, ‘purify,’ it would seem that he was properly engaged in the purification of the Soma pavama1na, ‘Soma purifying itself,’ and was perhaps employed to sing hymns to this Soma. Potra 4) Rv. ii. 1, 2, and probably i. 76, 4, though the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., gives this as an example of the second use. denotes both the office and the Soma vessel of the Potr2. 5) Rv. i. 15, 2; ii. 36, 2; 37, 2. 4.

पौंश्चलेय
पौंश्चलेय
 in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (iii. 8, 4, 2) denotes the son of a courtesan (Pum2s4eali1).

पौंसायन
पौंसायन
 is the patronymic of Dus2t2ari1tu in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xii. 9, 3, 1). 

पौञ्जिष्ठ
पौञ्जि-ष्ठ
 is the form in the Atharvaveda, 1) x. 4, 9. the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 2) xxx. 8. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 3) iii. 4, 5, 1, where Sa1yan2a glosses it with the word kaivarta, also probably the name of a functional caste. of the word Pun5jis2t2ha, denoting ‘fisherman.’ It is probably a caste name, ‘son of a Pun5jis2t2ha,’ as the designation of a functional caste.

पौण्डरीक
पौण्डरीक
 is the patronymic of Ks2emadhr2tvan in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xxii. 18, 7).

पौतक्रत
पौत-क्रत,
 ‘descendant of Pu1takrata1,’ is the metronymic of a man, apparently Dasyave Vr2ka, in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 56, 2. Scheftelowitz 2) Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 41, 42. proposes to read Pu1takratu with the Kashmir MS. of the Rigveda, arguing that in the same hymn Pu1takrata1yi1, the wife of Pu1takratu, is referred to, and that therefore Pu1takratu is appropriate, Pu1takrata1yi1 3) See Pa1n2ini, iv. 1, 36. being the feminine, like Mana1yi1, 4) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 8, 6; Pa1n2ini, iv. 1, 38. Perhaps also Vasa1vi1, Rv. x. 73, 4. for Mana1vi1. But the ordinary reading in the sense of descendant is perfectly legitimate, as Oldenberg 5) Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1907, 237. has pointed out.

पौतिमाषीपुत्र
पौतिमाषी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Pu1tima1s2a,’ is the metronymic of a teacher in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Ka1n2va recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 5, 1).

पौतिमाष्य
पौति-माष्य,
 ‘descendant of Pu1tima1s2a,’ is the patronymic of a teacher, a pupil of Gaupavana, in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) of the Ka1n2va recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (ii. 6, 1; iv. 6, 1).

पौतिमाष्यायण
पौतिमाष्यायण,
 ‘descendant of Pautima1s2ya’ is the patronymic of a teacher, who, with Kaun2d2inya1yana, taught Raibhya, in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) of the Ma1dhyam2dina recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26). 

पौत्र
पौत्र
 (‘descended from a son’) is the regular term for a ‘grandson’ from the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 5, 30; xi. 7, 16; xviii. 43, 9. onwards. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 10; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 8, 3, etc. When it is used beside Naptr2, 3) La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 3, 18; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, x. 11, 5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 10, 3. Cf. Delbru1ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 478. the latter word must denote ‘great-grandson.’

पौर
पौर,
 ‘descendant of Pu1ru,’ is the name of a man, presumably a Pu1ru prince helped by Indra, in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 3, 12. The Greek  the name of Alexander's rival, is probably the representative of this word. Oldenberg 2) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 362; as also Grassmann, Wo7rterbuch, s.v. sees the same name in another passage also. 3) v. 74, 4.

पौरुकुत्स
पौरु-कुत्स,
 1) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxii. 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 16, 3. Pauru-kutsi, 2) Rv. vii. 19, 3. Pauru-kutsya, 3) Rv. v. 33, 8; viii. 19, 36; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 5, 3. are variant forms of the patronymic of Trasadasyu, the descendant of Purukutsa.

पौरुशिष्टि
पौरु-शिष्टि,
 ‘descendant of Purus4is2t2a,’ is the patronymic of Taponitya in the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad (i. 9, 1 = Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, vii. 8, 1).

पौर्णमासी
पौर्ण-मासी,
 denoting the ‘night of the full moon,’ is celebrated in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 80. as sacred, while it is repeatedly mentioned later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 9, 1; ii. 2, 2, 1; iii. 4, 9, 6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 2, 4, etc. Gobhila 3) i. 5, 7. Three sorts of full moon are distinguished by Gobhila--that which occurs when the full moon rises at the meeting of day and night (sandhya1), when it rises shortly after sunset, or when it stands high in the sky. The two former alternatives are apparently those described in the passage (Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 11 = Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iii. 1) as pu1rva1 and uttara1. See Weber, Jyotis2a, 51; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 30, 26, n. defines it as the greatest separation (vikars2a) of the sun and the moon. Cf. Ma1sa. 

पौलुषि
पौलुषि,
 ‘descendant of Pulus2a,’ is the patronymic of Satyayajn5a in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (x. 6, 1, 1) and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (v. 11, 1). In the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (i. 39, 1) the form is Paulus2ita, which is perhaps merely an error.

पौल्कस
पौल्कस
 is the name of one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 17; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 14, 1. The name also occurs in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 2) iv. 3, 22. as that of a despised race of men, together with the Ca1n2d2a1la. The Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 3) i. 6, 11. has the variant Puklaka or Pulkaka, clearly the same as Pulkasa, of which Paulkasa is a derivative form, showing that a caste is meant (cf. Kaula1la, Paun5jis2t2ha). In the accepted theory 4) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., Pukkas4a. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 217, takes Paulkasa as a mixed caste. the Pulkasa is the son of a Nis2a1da or S4u1dra by a Ks2atriya woman, but this is merely speculative; the Paulkasa may either have been a functional caste, or, as Fick 5) Die sociale Gliederung, 206. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 416, n. 6. believes, an aboriginal clan living by catching wild beasts, and only occasionally reduced to menial tasks.

पौष्करसादि
पौष्कर-सादि
 (‘descendant of Pus2karasa1di’) is the name of a teacher mentioned in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 1) vii. 17. Cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 371. as well as the Taittiri1ya Pra1tis4a1khya. 2) i. 5; ii. 1, 2, 5; Pa1n2ini, viii. 4, 48; Va1rttika, 3; Kielhorn, Indian Antiquary, 16, 103; Pischel, ibid., 34, 26. A Pus2karasa1di is mentioned in the Dharma Su1tra 3) i. 6, 19, 7; 10, 28, 1. of A1pastamba and elsewhere.

पौष्पिण्ड्य
पौष्पिण्ड्य
 is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Jaimini, in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) at the end of the Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a. 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 377.

प्युक्ष्ण
प्युक्ष्ण
 is found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (v. 3, 1, 11) denoting the ‘covering’ for a bow (Dhanus), presumably made of skin. 

प्रउग
प्रौ१ग
 is apparently equivalent to pra-yuga, denoting the fore part of the pole of the cart, the part in front of the yoke. It is mentioned in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 4, 11, 1, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxi. 4. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 9; iii. 5, 3, 4, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 14, n. 1. where it is said to be the part of the pole behind the Kastambhi1, or prop on which the pole rests.

प्रकङ्कत
प्र-कङ्कत
 is the name of some noxious insect in the Rigveda. 1) i. 191, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

प्रकरितृ
प्र-करितृ
 is the name of one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 12; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 8, 1. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 315, n. 1; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 79, n. 6. The exact sense is uncertain; the commentator Sa1yan2a on the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a explains it to mean the ‘divider of dear ones by producing enmity,’ but the sense of ‘sprinkler’--that is, ‘seasoner’--is more likely.

प्रकश
प्र-कश
 in the Atharvaveda (ix. 1, 21) seems to mean either the ‘thong’ or the ‘lash’ of a whip.

प्रक्रम
प्र-क्रम,
 ‘stride,’ is mentioned as a measure of distance in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (x. 2, 3, 1 et seq.), but its exact length in unknown.

प्रक्ष
प्रक्ष
 is the form in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) vi. 3, 10, 2. of the usual name, Plaks2a, of a tree, being merely a phonetic alteration for the sake of the etymology. According to Aufrecht, 2) Rigveda, 2, xlvi. n. the same word is found in two passages of the Sa1maveda, 3) i. 444; ii. 465. the same reading occurring in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka. 4) v. 2, 2, with Keith's notes. Oldenberg, 5) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 344. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59. however, questions the correctness of the reading Praks2a, both in the latter passage and in the Sa1maveda. 

प्रगाथ
प्रगाथ
 is the name given in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka (ii. 2, 2) to the poets of the eighth Man2d2ala of the Rigveda, so called because they composed Praga1tha strophes (that is, verses consisting of a Br2hati1 or Kakubh followed by a Satobr2hati1).

प्रघात
प्र-घात
 is found in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 1, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 1. The word does not occur in Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 6, 2, 3. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) iii. 1, 2, 18. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 10, n. 1. in the sense of the closely woven ends of a cloth from which depend the loose threads of the Ni1vi, or unwoven fringe.

प्रचलाका
प्र-चलाका
 in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (vii. 5, 11, 1) and the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 (As4vamedha, v. 2) seems to mean a ‘cloudburst.’

प्रजावन्त्प्राजापत्य
प्रजावन्त् प्राजापत्य,
 ‘descendant of Praja1pati,’ is, according to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (i. 21), the author of a hymn of the Rigveda (x. 183).

प्रणपात्
प्र-णपात्
 in the Rigveda (viii. 17, 13) denotes ‘greatgrandson.’

प्रणेजन
प्र-णेजन
 is the word used in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (i. 2, 2, 18) to denote the ‘water used for washing.’

प्रततामह
प्र-ततामह,
 ‘great-grandfather,’ is found in the Atharvaveda (xviii. 4, 75).

प्रतर्दन
प्र-तर्दन
 is the name in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 1) xxi. 10. of a king who had a Bharadva1ja for his Purohita. In the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 2) xxvi. 5. he appears as arriving at the sacrifice of the R2s2is in the Naimis2a forest, and asking them how errors in the sacrifice could be remedied; and as finding Ali1kayu Va1caspata, the Brahman priest at the sacrifice, unable to say what was to be done. In the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 3) iii. 1. it is said that Pratardana Daivoda1si went to Indra's world through his death in battle. The patronymic connects him with Divoda1sa, the ancestor or father of Suda1s, and the mention of Bharadva1ja (probably ‘a Bharadva1ja’ is meant) as his priest supports the patronymic, for Divoda1sa is a special favourite of the singers of the Bharadva1ja family. The name, moreover, is reminiscent of the Tr2tsus (the root tard appears in both) and of the Pratr2dah2 (see Pratr2d). But he is not in Vedic literature a king of Ka1s4i. 4) As in the Epic; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 38 Geldner 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 138. regards him as Divoda1sa's son, but this is not likely. Cf. Pra1tardani.

प्रतिथिदेवतरथ
प्र-तिथि देव-तरथ
 is the name of a teacher, pupil of Devataras S4a1vasa1yana in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373, 385; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 444.

प्रतिदीवन्
प्रति-दीवन्
 denotes in the Rigveda (x. 38, 6) and the Atharvaveda (vii. 109, 4) ‘opponent in the game of dice.’

प्रतिदुह्
प्रति-दुह्
 has the specific sense of ‘fresh milk,’ warm from the cow, in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Av. ix. 4, 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 3, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 6, etc. and the Bra1hman2as. 2) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 5, 5; xviii. 4, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 3, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 6, 2, etc.

प्रतिधा
प्रति-धा
 apparently means ‘draught’ or ‘pull’ in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 77, 4; Nirukta, v. 11. where Indra is said to have drunk thirty streams (sara1m2si) with one Pratidha1.

प्रतिधि
प्रति-धि
 is mentioned in the Su1rya1 hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 85, 8. as part of the chariot on which the bride is taken home. It is impossible to determine with certainty exactly what is meant; Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. understands it to mean a cross-piece of wood fastened to the pole.

प्रतिपण
प्रति-पण
 is found in the Atharvaveda (iii. 15, 4) denoting ‘barter’ or ‘exchange.’ Cf. Pan2a.

प्रतिप्रश्न
प्रति-प्रश्न
 occurs in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) i. 4, 5, 11; iv. 1, 3, 14; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 131, and 26, 267, renders pratipras4nam by ‘(went to Praja1pati) for his decision,’ which leaves it ambiguous how he took the passages. applied to Praja1pati as the decider of doubts; it may have been a technical term for an ‘arbitrator’ (cf. Madhyamas4i1 and harma).

प्रतिप्रस्थातृ
प्रति-प्र-स्थातृ
 is the name of a priest (R2tvij), one of the assistants of the Adhvaryu, in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 3, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 29; vii. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 2, 2; 3, 13, 22, etc. He is not mentioned in the Rigveda, 2) Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 384, n. 2. but mention is once made in that Sam2hita1 3) ii. 16, 5. of the two Adhvaryus. These may have meant, as later, the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprastha1tr2. Oldenberg, 4) Op. cit., 390, n. 2. however, thinks that the Adhvaryu and the Agni1dh are intended, a conjecture for which there is some authority. 5) Cf. Rv. x. 41, 3; Mantra in S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 6, 3. Cf. Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 97.

प्रतिप्राश्

 is a wrong reading for Pra1ti1bodhi1-putra. 1) Indische Studien, 1, 391; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 244, 310,

प्रतिमित्
प्रति-मित्
 is found in the description of a house in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 3, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 596. The sense must be ‘support’ of some sort, probably beams leaning up at an angle against the Upamits. 

प्रतिवेश
प्रति-वेश,
 ‘neighbour,’ occurs, often metaphorically, from the Rigveda 1) x. 66, 13. onwards. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 97; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 75; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvi. 9; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 2; Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, i. 4, 3.

प्रतिवेश्य
प्रति-वेश्य
 is mentioned in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) at the end of the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka (xv. 1) as the pupil of Br2haddiva. Cf. Pra1tives4ya.

 ‘echo,’ shows that this phenomenon had already received a name as early as the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 13; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, As4vamedha, vii. 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 32; xxx. 19. and the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad (iv. 13).

प्रतिष्ठा
प्रति-ष्ठा
 is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 32, 3 = viii. 8, 21 = S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 14. where Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 181. thinks the word is used as a technical term of law; possibly a ‘sanctuary’ may be meant, but it is more than doubtful whether the sense of ‘home’ or ‘abode,’ as given by Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 3. So a pratis2t2ha1-ka1ma, ‘one desirous of a fixed abode,’ Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 3, 4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiii. 18, 1, etc. is not quite adequate. Cf. Jn5a1tr2.

प्रतिसर
प्रति-सर
 is used in several passages of the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 11, 2; iv. 40, 1; viii. 5, 1. 4. and later 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 4, 20; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 30, etc. to denote an amulet, according to Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., followed by Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 53, n. 2. because it was a band, and so returned on itself (prati-sr2, ‘go back’). The sense is doubtful; perhaps ‘attacking’ may really be the root idea. 4) Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, cxxxiii; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 576. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 263; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 345; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 164. Cf. Punah2sara. 

प्रतिहर्तृ
प्रति-हर्तृ
 is the name of the assistant of the Udga1tr2 in the list of the sixteen priests (R2tvij). It is found in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 2, 1. and the Bra1hman2as, 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 2, 3; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 4, 22; xii. 1, 1, 8; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 15, 3; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 10, 11; 11, 8. but not in the Rigveda. 3) Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 227.

प्रतीदर्शश्वैक्न
प्रती-दर्श श्वैक्न
 is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 4, 4, 3. as sacrificing with the Da1ks2a1yan2a offering, and as teaching Suplan Sa1rn5jaya, who thence became Sahadeva Sa1rn5jaya. In a second passage 2) xii. 8, 2, 3. he is called Prati1dars4a Aibha1vata, and again brought into connexion with Suplan Sa1rn5jaya. According to Eggeling, 3) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 239, n. 2. he is to be deemed a king of the S4viknas; apparently, too, he was a descendant of Ibha1vant. A Prati1dars4a is also mentioned in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 4) iv. 8, 7.

प्रतीपप्रातिसत्वन
प्रतीप प्रातिसत्वन,
 1) So Khila, v. 15, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 33, 2. or Pra1tisutvana, 2) So Av. xx. 129, 2. Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 161; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 18, 1. is the name of a man mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda. 2) So Av. xx. 129, 2. Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 161; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 18, 1. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 131. with great ingenuity, compares the fact that Pariks2it is mentioned as a Kuru king in the Atharvaveda, 4) xx. 127. and that, according to the Epic genealogies, his grandson was Pratis4ravas, with which name Pra1tisutvana, as very possibly a Pra1kritized version of Pra1tis4rutvana may be compared, and his great-grandson was Prati1pa. The identification cannot, however, be regarded as at all certain, and while the Epic may have derived its genealogy from the Atharvaveda, it may have preserved an independent tradition. Bo7htlingk 5) Dictionary, s.v. renders pra1tisatvanam as ‘in the direction opposed to the Satvans’, and this may be right. 

प्रतीबोध
प्रती-बोध
 is mentioned with Bodha in two passages of the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 30, 10; viii. 1, 13. Cf. Ma1nava Gr2hya Su1tra, ii. 15, 1. apparently as the name of a very mythic R2s2i, ‘Intelligence.’

प्रतृद्
प्रतृद्
 occurs once in the plural in a hymn of the R2gveda, 1) vii. 33, 14. where it is clearly a variant of the word Tr2tsu. Moreover, the name of King Pratardana, a descendant of the Tr2tsu king, Divoda1sa, confirms the identification of Tr2tsu and Pratr2d. 2) See Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 138.

प्रतोद
प्र-तोद
 denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) xv. 2, 1. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xvii. 1, 14. See S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 8; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 4, 10; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 6, 7; S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xiv. 72, 3. The rendering ‘lance’ seems to have no authority. But see Weber, Indian Literature, 67. the ‘goad’ of the Vra1tya, the non-Brahminical A1ryan or aborigine. Later the word is regularly used for ‘goad’ in general.

प्रत्यक्षदर्शन
प्रत्यक्ष-दर्शन,
 n., means ‘seeing with one's own eyes,’ as opposed to seeing in a vision (svapna). A section on such visions appears in the Rigveda A1ran2yakas. 1) Aitareva A1ranyaka, iii. 2, 4; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 7.

प्रत्येनस्
प्रत्य्-एनस्
 is found with Ugra and Su1ta-gra1man2i1 in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 1) iv. 3, 43. 44 (Ma1dhyam2dina = iv. 3, 37. 38 Ka1n2va). clearly denoting an officer of police. The sense must be that of the humbler ‘servants’ of the king 2) Bo7htlingk's Translation, p. 66, where he takes ugra as an adjective. rather than ‘magistrates,’ as Max Mu7ller, in his translation, takes it. In the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 3) viii. 4 (Indische Studien, 3, 463). and the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 4) iv. 16, 16. 17. the word means, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the next heir, who is responsible for the debts of a dead man. 

प्रदर
प्र-दर
 in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 35, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 10, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 2, 3, 8; xiii. 8, 3, 10, etc. denotes a ‘cleft’ in the ground. ^1 Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 8, 5; v. 2, 4, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxv. 7.

प्रदिव्
प्र-दिव्
 in the Atharvaveda (xviii. 2, 48) is the third and highest heaven, in which the Fathers dwell. In the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a (xx. 1) it is the fifth of a series of seven heavens.

प्रदिश्
प्र-दिश्,
 like Dis4, normally designates only a ‘quarter’ of the sky, or ‘point’ of the compass. Four, 1) Rv. i. 164, 42; vii. 35, 8; x. 19, 8; Av. i. 11, 2; ii. 10, 3. five, 2) Rv. ix. 86, 29; Av. i. 30, 4; iii. 4, 2; 20, 9. six, 3) Av. iv. 11, 1; 20, 2; x. 7, 35. and seven 4) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 32. such points are enumerated, or more generally ‘all’ are mentioned. 5) Rv. vi. 75, 2; x. 121, 4. In some passages, 6) Av. v. 28, 2; ix. 2, 21; xix. 20, 2, etc. on the other hand, the word has the definite sense of an ‘intermediate quarter,’ which is more precisely denoted by ava1ntara-dis4.

प्रधन
प्र-धन
 denotes ‘contest,’ whether the real conflict of war or the competition of the chariot race, in the Rigveda. 1) i. 116, 2; 154, 3; 169, 2; x. 102, 5, etc.

प्रधि
प्र-धि
 is the name of some part of the wheel of a chariot, probably the ‘felly.’ In one passage of the Rigveda, 1) ii. 39, 4. and in one of the Atharvaveda, 2) vi. 70, 3. the ‘nave’ (Nabhya) and the ‘felly’ (pradhi) are mentioned along with the Upadhi, which must then be either a collective name for the spokes or an inner rim within the felly and binding the spokes. In the riddle hymn of the Rigveda 3) i. 164, 48. twelve Pradhis are mentioned with three naves, one wheel, and three hundred and sixty spokes; what exactly is here meant by this particular term it would be useless to conjecture, though it is clear that the passage as a whole symbolizes the year with three seasons, twelve months, and three hundred and sixty days. Elsewhere 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 11, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 15; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 5, 23. the nave and the Pradhi alone are mentioned, or the Pradhi occurs by itself. 5) Rv. iv. 30, 15; x. 102, 7, etc. In Av. xviii. 2, 14, Pradha1v adhi is merely an incorrect variant of the pradha1vati of Rv. x. 154, 1. The same corruption is seen by Lanman (in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, xcii) in Av. vi. 70, 3 (n. 2). Cf. Whitney, op. cit., 334; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248.

प्रध्वंसन
प्र-ध्वंसन
 See Pra1dhvam2sana

प्रपण
प्र-पण
 in the Atharvaveda (xii. 15, 4. 5) denotes ‘barter’ or ‘exchange,’ balanced by Pratipan2a.

प्रपथ
प्र-पथ
 in the Rigveda 1) x. 17, 4. 6; 63, 16. and the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 2) vii. 15. denotes a ‘long journey.’ Wilson 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 151. has seen in one passage 4) Rv. i. 166, 9. the sense of ‘resting-place,’ where travellers can obtain food (kha1di). Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 231. shows that this is impossible, and the reading (prapathes2u) in the passage in question is not improbably 6) Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 108; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 166. Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v., does not follow Roth. an error for prapades2u. In the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 7) xxxvii. 14 (Indische Studien, 3, 466). the word means a ‘broad road.’

प्रपथिन्
प्र-पथिन्
 1) Prapathi1 might be the stem, the word occurring as a proper name in the nominative singular only (cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammer, 377, 3); but this is not probable, the stem prapathin being otherwise found as an adjective is the name of a patron, perhaps a Ya1dava, in one hymn of the Rigveda. 2) viii. 1, 30. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90. 

प्रपा
प्र-पा
 seems to denote a ‘spring’ in the desert in the only Rigveda passage where it occurs. 1) x. 4, 1. In the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 30, 6. Cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 1, 2. it has merely the sense of ‘drinking,’ or a ‘drink.’

प्रपितामह
प्र-पितामह,
 ‘great-grandfather,’ is found in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 5, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 36; Av. xviii. 4, 35. and the Bra1hman2as. 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 2, 16; xii. 8, 1, 7.

प्रपित्व
प्र-पित्व
 is found in several passages of the Rigveda as a designation of time. In one passage 1) viii. 1, 29. the sense is made clear by the context: ‘at the rising of the sun’ (su1ra udite), ‘at midday’ (madhyam2dine divah2), and ‘at the Prapitva, bordering on the night’ (apis4arvare). In another passage 2) vii. 41, 4. the sense of ‘late in the day’ also seems adequate, while the phrase 3) iv. 16, 12. abhipitve ahnah2, ‘at the close of day,’ also denotes the evening. According to Geldner, 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 174 et seq. the sense of the word is the ‘decisive moment’ in a race or a battle, and so the ‘end of the day.’ 5) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., took it to mean ‘daybreak’; so also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 362. Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v., on the other hand, gives the meaning as ‘decline of day,’ ‘evening.’ See also Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 24 et seq.; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 183 et seq. Cf. Ahan.

प्रप्रोथ
प्र-प्रोथ
 is the name in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (viii. 4, 1) of a plant used as a substitute for Soma.

प्रफर्वी
प्र-फर्वी
 denotes a ‘wanton woman’ in the Rigveda (x. 85, 22), the Atharvaveda (v. 22, 7), and the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 5, 6; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 12; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 71.

प्रबुध्
प्र-बुध्,
 occurring in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 27, 19), is used in the locative parallel with nimruci, ‘at the setting (of the sun),’ and clearly means ‘at the rising (of the sun).’ 

प्रमगन्द
प्र-मगन्द
 is the name of a prince in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 53, 14. where he is mentioned as the king of the Ki1kat2as, and where he seems to be designated by the epithet naica1s4a1kha, ‘belonging to a low branch or race.’ On the other hand, Ya1ska 2) Nirukta, vi. 32. takes Pramaganda to mean the ‘son of a usurer,’ an explanation that is hardly probable. Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-16. 241-245. thinks that naica1s4a1kha refers not to Pramaganda, but to the Soma plant, the plant being called ni1ca1s4a1kha, ‘having shoots turned downwards,’ and that the passage refers to a raid against the Ki1kat2as, who were not observers of the milk cult or the Soma cult, with the intention of winning their lands where the Soma grew and where there were cows. Bo7htlingk, 4) Proceedings of the Saxon Academy, December 12, 1891. however, questions this view, which is not very probable. A place name is possibly meant by Naica1s4a1kha. 5) Sa1yan2a, in his introduction to his commentary on the Rigveda, p. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 31; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 6, 153; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 58. The name Pramaganda seems un-A1ryan.

प्रमन्दनी
प्र-मन्दनी
 is the name of an Apsaras in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 37, 3. Probably the word primarily denoted a certain sweet-scented plant, which seems to be the sense of pra-manda in the Kaus4ika Su1tra. 2) viii. 17; xxv. 11; xxxii. 29; nis2pramanda, xxxvi. 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 15, n. 11.

प्रमर
प्र-मर
 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) x. 27, 20. is taken by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. to be a proper name.

प्रमोत
प्र-मोत
 is the name of some sort of disease in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 8, 4. according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Zimmer, 2) Altindisches Leben, 378, n. however, thinks that the word must be an adjective meaning ‘dumb.’ This view is accepted, though with doubt, by Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 550. and by Bloomfield. 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 601. 

प्रयोग
प्र-योग
 is the name of a seer in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 10, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xix. 10 (Indische Studien, 3, 478).

प्रयोग्य
प्र-योग्य
 denotes in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (viii. 12, 3) an animal yoked to a carriage, ‘draught animal.’

प्रलाप
प्र-लाप,
 ‘prattle,’ is found with other words of similar import in the Atharvaveda, 1) xi. 8, 25. and in the Bra1hman2as 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 33; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 5; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 17, 6, etc. of the Rigveda. The phrase Aitas4a-prala1pa, ‘Discourse of Aitas4a,’ occurs as a designation of certain passages of the Atharvaveda. 3) See Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, pp. 98, 101, n. 12; Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 159 et seq.; Macdonell, Br2haddevata1, 2, 323. The name has no justification in the text itself.

प्रवचन
प्र-वचन
 means ‘oral instruction,’ ‘teaching,’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xi. 5, 7, 1. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, i. 1, 3, 9; Ka1t2haka Upanis2ad, ii. 23; Mun2d2aka Upanis2ad, iii. 2, 3, etc.

प्रवत्
प्र-वत्,
 ‘height,’ is contrasted with Nivat, ‘valley,’ in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 50, 4. where it occurs several times. 2) Rv. ii. 13, 2; iv. 17, 7; 22, 4; vi. 17, 12; vii. 32, 27; x. 14, 1; 57, 12; 75, 4. The word is also found later. 3) Av. i. 13, 2; 26, 3; vi. 28, 3; x. 10, 2; xii. 1, 2; xviii. 4, 7.

प्रवर
1. Pra-vara denotes properly the ‘summons’ addressed to Agni at the beginning of the sacrifice to perform his functions. But as Agni was then invoked by the names of the ancestors of the Purohita, 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 25. See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 78. the term Pravara denotes the series of ancestors invoked. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 1, 9; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 1, 1. 20; iii. 7, 4, 9; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 31, etc. 

प्रवर
2. Pra-vara, 1) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 10. in the Ma1dhyam2dina recension. or Pra-va1ra, 2) Sa1yan2a on Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, loc. cit.; and Ka1n2va recension, vi. 2, 7. denotes a ‘covering’ or ‘woollen cloth’ in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad.

प्रवर्त
प्र-वर्त,
 occurring in the description of the Vra1tya in the Atharvaveda (xv. 2, 1, et seq.), is explained by the St. Petersburg Dictionary as a ‘round ornament.’ According to the commentator on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (2, 453 Bibl. Ind.), it means an ‘ear-ring.’

प्रवल्हिका
प्र-वल्हिका,
 a ‘riddle,’ is the name given in the Bra1hman2as of the Rigveda 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 33; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 7. to certain verses of the Atharvaveda. 2) xx. 133; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 22; Khila, v. 16. Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 98-100.

प्रवात
प्र-वात,
 ‘a windy spot,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 34, 1; Nirukta, ix. 8. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 119, thinks the reference here is to nuts being blown down in a storm of wind. as the place where the Vibhi1taka nuts, used as dice (Aks2a) grow. In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 2) vi. 4, 7, 2. reference is made to the exposure of decaying matter in such a place.

प्रवार
प्र-वार
 See 2. Pravara.

प्रवास
प्र-वा¤स,
 ‘dwelling abroad,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 29, 8. Ceremonies applicable to one who has returned from foreign residence are given in the Su1tras. 2) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 15; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, ii. 17, etc.

प्रवाहणजैवलि
प्र-वाहण जैवलि
 or Jaivala (‘descendant of Ji1vala’) is the name of a prince, contemporary with Udda1laka, who appears in the Upanis2ads 1) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 1. 7 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 2, 1, 4 Ka1n2va); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 8, 1; v. 3, 1. as engaged in philosophical discussions. He is probably identical with the Jaivali of the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 2) i. 38, 4.

प्रशस्
प्र-शस्
 in a Mantra in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 6, 5. Cf. Durga on Nirukta, v. 11. denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, an ‘axe,’ or some similar instrument for cutting. 2) From s4as, ‘to cut.’

प्रशास्तृ
प्र-शास्तृ
 is the name of one of the priests (R2tvij) at the Vedic sacrifice. In the lesser sacrifices he plays no part at all, but he appears in the animal (pas4u) and Soma sacrifices, in the former as the only, in the latter as the main, assistant of the Hotr2 priest in the singing of the litanies. He is mentioned by name in the Rigveda, 1) i. 94, 6; ii. 5, 4; pras4a1stra, ‘the Soma bowl of the Pras4a1str2,’ 36, 6; pras4a1stra, ‘the office of the Pras4a1str2,’ ii. 1, 2 = x, 91, 10. and often later. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 21; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 34; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 6, 6, 6; xi. 5, 5, 9, etc. He is also in the Rigveda 3) iv. 9, 5; vi. 71, 5; ix. 95, 5. According to Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 226, the Upavaktr2 is the earliest equivalent of the Asha1va1ka. called Upavaktr2, this name, like Pras4a1str2, being derived from the fact that one of his chief functions was to issue directions (prais2a) to the other priests. Another name for him was Maitra1varun2a, because his litanies were mainly addressed to Mitra and Varun2a, a connexion already visible in the Rigveda. 4) ii. 36, 6. The ‘two divine Hotr2s’ of the A1pri1 litanies denote, according to Oldenberg, 5) Religion des Veda, 391. Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 227, identifies the Pras4a1str2 with the Prastotr2, but this is most improbable. Cf. Oldenberg, op. cit., 383, 390, 391; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 141 et seq. the heavenly counterparts of the Hotr2 and the Pras4a1str2.

प्रश्न
प्रश्न
 denotes generally ‘enquiry’ or ‘disputed question,’ the phrase pras4nam eti having the sense ‘he asks a person for the decision of a disputed point’ in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) ii. 5, 8, 5; 11, 9. and elsewhere. 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 6, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 28. Thus Pras4na comes to have the definite meaning of ‘decision in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 3) v. 14. In the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda 4) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 10; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 6, 1. are included the Pras4nin, the Abhi-pras4nin, and the Pras4na-viva1ka; it is quite likely that here the three parties to a civil case are meant--the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator or judge (Madhyamas4i1).

प्रष्टि
प्रष्टि,
 like Pr2s2t2ya1, denotes a ‘side horse,’ which, however, possibly 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. did not necessarily mean a horse running beside the yoke-horses, but may also have meant a third horse yoked in front as a leader. This seems to be indicated by the reference in the Rigveda 2) i. 39, 6; viii. 27, 8. In i. 100, 17, pras2t2ibhih2 seems to refer to the assistants or comrades of R2jra1s4va (cf. La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 12, 14); but Ludwig thinks that the word refers to the steeds by which a victory was won. to the Pras2t2i--here applied to the Maruts’ team--leading (vahati) the team (rohitah2). In an obscure passage of the Atharvaveda 3) x. 8, 8. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 597. there is a reference to the Pras2t2is in connexion with a pan5ca-va1hi1, ‘drawn by five,’ but it is impossible to gain any clear idea of what is meant. The Pras2t2i is not rarely referred to elsewhere. 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 22; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 21, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 3, 9, etc. In one passage 5) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 12, 5. the dhuryau and the pras2t2yau are mentioned together; this probably means the two horses yoked to the pole, with two others fastened in some way one on each side. The adjectives pras2t2imant, 6) Rv. vi. 27, 24. pras2t2i-va1hana, 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 4, 9. pras2t2i-va1hin, 8) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 6, 4; 7, 1, 5; 9, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 13, 12 (where pras2t2hi-va1hin and pras2t2i-va1hin are confused). Geldner's conjecture, Rigveda, Glossar, 119, that Pras2t2i denotes a horse yoked in the middle, is withdrawn by himself, Kommentar, 97. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 250; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 102. are all used of Ratha, ‘chariot,’ meaning ‘drawn by a side horse (or horses)’ in addition to the yoke-horses. Cf. Ratha.

 is the name of a R2s2i who is credited by the Anukraman2i1 (Index) with the authorship of certain hymns of the Rigveda, 1) i. 44-50; viii. 49; ix. 95. where 2) i. 44, 6; 45, 3; viii. 3, 9; 51, 2; 54, 8. Cf. Nirukta, iii. 17. he is mentioned several times. The statement in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 3) xvi. 11, 26. that he obtained bounty from Pr2s2adhra Medhya Ma1taris4van is apparently a blunder. 4) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 39. Cf.

According to the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 3) xvi. 11, 11. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 30, 31; Macdonell, Br2haddevata1, 2, 198 et seq.

His not being mentioned by name in the Rigveda is merely an accident, for he is clearly referred to in one passage, 2) viii. 81, 5 (pra stos2at). See Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 393, n. 3. and in the later literature 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 2, 1; vi. 6, 3, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 2, 3; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 34; vii. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 2, 5, 3; v. 4, 5, 22; xii. 1, 1, 6, etc.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 10, 8, etc. he is a frequent figure.

 as an adjective denotes ‘having the supporting beam of the roof facing the east’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 1, 1, 6. 7; 6, 1, 23; iv. 6, 8, 20. and the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxii. 13; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 1, 3. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 3, n. 2. The reference is to the central beam running from the middle of the western end of a hall to the middle of the eastern end.

प्राच्य
प्राच्य
 denotes in the plural ‘dwellers in the east.’ They are mentioned in the list of peoples in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) viii. 14. It is very probable that the Ka1s4is, Kosalas, Videhas, and perhaps Magadhas, are meant, as Oldenberg 2) Buddha, 393, n. supposes. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) i. 7, 3, 8. the Easterns are said to call Agni by the name of S4arva, and their mode of making tombs is there 4) xiii. 8, 1, 5; 2, 1. Cf. also ix. 5, 1, 64. These passages render improbable the earlier view of Weber (Indian Literature, 132, 133) that this Bra1hman2a is a product of the Eastern peoples, and support his later view that the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, like the other great Bra1hman2as, belongs to the Madhyades4a (see Kuru, n. 1). referred to with disapproval. The La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra 5) viii. 6, 9. explains the Vipatha, ‘rough car,’ of the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 6) xvii. 1. as a car of the Easterns (pra1cya-ratha). In the Sam2hitopanis2ad Bra1hman2a 7) 2; Weber, Indian Literature, 34, n. 25. reference is made to the Pra1cyaPa1n5ca1las.

प्राण
प्राण,
 properly denoting ‘breath,’ is a term of wide and vague significance in Vedic literature. It is frequently mentioned from the Rigveda 1) i. 66, 1; x. 59, 6; 90, 13, etc. onwards; in the A1ran2yakas and Upanis2ads it is one of the commonest symbols of the unity of the universe. 2) Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 89 et seq. In the narrow sense Pra1n2a denotes one of the vital airs, of which five are usually 3) See Uda1na, n. 1. enumerated--Pra1n2a, Apa1na, Vya1na, Uda1na, and Sama1na; but often only two, Pra1n2a and Apa1na, 4) Av. ii. 28, 3; v. 4, 7 (Paipp.); vii. 53, 4 (in vii. 53, 3, Apa1na, Pra1n2a); Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 1, 4, etc. or Pra1n2a and Vya1na, 5) Av. v, 4, 7; vi. 41, 2, etc. or Pra1n2a and Uda1na; 6) See Uda1na, n. 3. or three, Pra1n2a, Apa1na, and Vya1na, 7) Av. xiii. 2, 46; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 6, 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 23; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 29; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, vi. 10; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 8; Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, ii. 2, etc. or Pra1n2a, Uda1na, and Vya1na, 8) See Uda1na, n. 2. or Pra1n2a, Uda1na, and Sama1na; 9) Ibid. or four, Pra1n2a, Apa1na, Vya1na, and Sama1na, 10) Av. x. 2, 13. or Pra1n2a, Apa1na, Uda1na, Vya1na. 11) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad iii. 4, 1. The exact sense of each of these breaths when all are mentioned cannot be determined. 12) Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 273 et seq.

प्राण
प्राण
 is also used in a wider sense to denote the organs of sense, 13) Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, 1, 339, 355; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1. or as Sa1yan2a 14) On Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 3, 7. puts it, the ‘orifices of the head,’ etc. These are given as six in one passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 15) xiv. 1. 3, 32; 4, 1. presumably the eyes, ears, and nostrils. More frequently there are stated to be seven in the head, the mouth being then included. 16) Av. ii. 12, 7; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 17; iii. 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 3, 21; vi. 4, 2, 5; xiii. 1, 7, 2; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 9, 10; 6, 8, etc. Sometimes again they are mentioned as nine, 17) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 10, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 7, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 2, 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxii. 12, 5; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 4, 1; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, ii. 2; Av. v. 28, 1; x. 8, 43 (navadva1ram), etc. or as seven in the head and two below. 18) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 9, 10; 6, 8. Ten are counted in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 19) xi. 6, 3, 17, where the eleventh is given as the A1tman. and the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, 20) ii. 77 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 240). while even eleven are mentioned in the Ka1t2haka Upanis2ad, 21) v. 1. and twelve in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 22) xxxiii. 3. where the two breasts are added. Exactly what organs are taken to make up the numbers beyond seven is not certain. 23) Cf. Deussen, op. cit., 269; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaha, 185, 187. The tenth is the navel (na1bhi) in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1; 24) iv. 6, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 16. when eleven are named the Brahma-randhra 25) Aitareya Upanis2ad, i. 3. (suture in the crown) may be included; in the Atharvaveda, 26) x. 8, 9. as interpreted by the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 27) ii. 2, 3, 4. the seventh and eighth are the organs of taste and speech respectively. But usually these make one only, and the eighth and ninth are either in the breast 28) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiii. 3. or below (the organs of evacuation). 29) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 9, 10; 6, 8. The word Pra1n2a has sometimes merely the general sense of breath, even when opposed to Apa1na. 30) Av. v. 4, 7 (Paippala1da) . See Blloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 552. But its proper sense is beyond question ‘breathing forth,’ ‘expiration,’ and not as the St. Petersburg Dictionary explains it, ‘the breath inspired,’ a version due to the desire to interpret Apa1na as ‘expiration,’ a meaning suggested by the preposition apa, ‘away.’ This being clearly shown both by the native scholiasts 31) Rudradatta on A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 8, 8; xiv. 11, 1; Sa1yan2a on S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 3, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 6, 4; S4an3kara on Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 3, 2; A1narti1ya on S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vi. 8, 1, 2, etc. and by other evidence, 32) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 2, 15, as compared with Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 8, 29; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 2, 2; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 60, 5; ii. 1, 16. 19; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 1, 4. See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 261-265; 56, 556-558; and Apa1na. Bo7htlingk 33) Zeitschrift, 55, 518. later accepted the new view.

Mahi1dhara 3) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. and Sa1yan2a 4) On Av. xix. 34, 10. interpret the term as ‘consumption.’ Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 385-387. supports this view on the ground that it is mentioned 6) Av. ix. 8, 10. as a kind of Yaks2ma, makes the bones and joints fall apart (asthi-sram2sa, paruh2-sram2sa), 7) Av. vi. 14, 1. and is caused by love, aversion, and the heart, 8) ix. 8, 8. characteristics which agree with the statements of the later Hindu medicine. 9) Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 321, 322. It is in keeping with a demon of the character of consumption that Bala1sa should appear as an accompaniment of Takman. 10) Av. iv. 9, 8; xix. 34, 10. Grohmann, 11) Indische Studien, 9, 396 et seq. however, thought that a ‘sore’ or ‘swelling’ (in the case of fever caused by dropsy) was meant. Bloomfield 12) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 450. considers that the question is still open. Ludwig 13) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 510. renders the word by ‘dropsy.’ As remedies against the disease the salve (A1n5jasa) from Trikakud 14) Av. iv. 9, 8. and the Jan3gid2a 15) Av. xix. 34, 10. plant are mentioned.

बलि
बलि
 occurs several times in the Rigveda 1) To a god, Rv. i. 70, 9; v. 1, 10; viii. 100, 9; to a king, in the compound bali-hr2t, ‘paying tribute,’ vii. 6, 5; x. 173, 6. and often later 2) Metaphorically: Av. vi. 117, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 3, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxix. 7; Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, i. 5, 3, etc.; bali-hr2t, Av. xi. 4, 19; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, loc. cit.; bali-ha1ra, Av. xi. 1, 20; literally: Av. iii. 4, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 18, 3; iii. 12, 2, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 2, 15; 5, 3, 18; 6, 3, 17; xi 2, 6, 14; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xv. 7, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 29 (cf. vii. 34); bali-hr2t, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxix. 9; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 2, 1. in the sense of tribute to a king or offering to a god. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 166, 167. thinks that the offerings were in both cases voluntary. He compares the notices of the Germans in Tacitus, 4) Germania, 15. where the kings of the tribes are said to receive gifts in kind as presents, but not a regular tribute. There seems to be no ground whatever for this view. No doubt in origin the prerogatives of monarchy were due to voluntary action on the part of the tribesmen, 5) Later, too, benevolences (pran2aya1kriya1) were known. See Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 760762. but that the Vedic peoples, who were essentially a body of conquering invaders, were in this state is most improbable, and the attitude of the Vedic Indian to his gods was at least as compatible with tribute as with voluntary gifts. Zimmer admits that in the case of hostile tribes 6) See Rv. vii. 6, 5; 18, 19. tribute must be meant even in the Rigveda. See also Ra1jan.

बल्कस
बल्कस
 denotes impure matter given off in the process of fermentation in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) xii. 8, 1, 16; 9, 1, 2. The exact sense may be either ‘scum,’ ‘sediment,’ 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., Flocken (‘flakes’). or perhaps more probably vegetable matter in the form of ‘husks.’ 3) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 236, n. 1.

बल्बज
बल्बज
 is the name of the grass called Eleusine indica. It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) xiv. 2, 22. 23. and is said in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 8, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 10; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 5. to be produced from the excrements of cattle. In the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 8, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 10; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 5. it is stated to be used for the sacrificial litter (Barhis) and for fuel. Baskets or other products made from this grass are referred to in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda. 3) viii. 55. 3. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69, 70.

बल्हिक
1. Balhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 22, 5. 7. 9. where the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the Mu1javants, the Maha1vr2s2as, and the Balhikas. The Mu1javants are quite certainly a northern tribe, and though, as Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 446. suggests, the passage may contain a pun on Balhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from bahis, ‘without’), still no doubt the name was chosen from a northern tribe. But the view of Roth 3) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 41. and Weber, 4) Indische Studien, 1, 205; Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1892, 985-995. which Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 130. once accepted, that an Iranian tribe is referred to (cf. Balkh), is not at all probable. Zimmer 6) Op. cit., 431-433. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 260; Hopkins, Great Epic of India, 373. shows that there is no need whatever to assume Iranian influence. See also Pars4u.

बल्हिकप्रातिपीय
2. Balhika Pra1tipi1ya is the name of a Kuru king in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) xii. 9, 3, 3. where he appears as having been opposed to the restoration of Dus2t2ari1tu Paum2sa1yana to his hereditary sovereignty over the Sr2n5jayas, but as having failed to prevent the restoration being carried out by Revottaras Pa1t2ava Ca1kra Sthapati. The epithet Pra1tipi1ya is curious: if it connects him with Prati1pa (whose son he is in the Epic), the form is remarkable, Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 432. indeed tacitly altering it to Pra1ti1pi1ya. In the Epic and the Pura1n2as 3) See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 273 et seq.; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 131-136. he is in the form of Va1hli1ka made a brother of Deva1pi and S4antanu, and a son of Prati1pa. To base chronological conclusions on this 4) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 52. would be utterly misleading, for the facts are that Deva1pi was son of R2s2t2is2en2a and a priest, while S4antanu was a Kuru prince of unknown parentage, but not probably a son of Prati1pa, who seems to be a late figure in the Vedic age, later than Pariks2it, being his great-grandson in the Epic. Very possibly Balhika was a descendant of Prati1pa. Why he bore the name Balhika must remain uncertain, for there is no evidence of any sort regarding it.

बल्बूथ
बल्बूथ
 is mentioned in one hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 46, 32. along with Taruks2a and Pr2thus4ravas, as a giver of gifts to the singer. He is called a Da1sa, but Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. da1sa. was inclined to amend the text so as to say that the singer received a hundred Da1sas from Balbu1tha. Zimmer's 3) Altindisches Leben, 117. suggestion that he may have been the son of an aboriginal mother, or perhaps an aboriginal himself, seems probable. 4) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 30; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 196. If this was the case, it would be a clear piece of evidence for the establishment of friendly relations between the A1ryans and the Da1sas.

बस्त
1. Basta denotes the ‘goat’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 13. The passage is unintelligible; for a guess, see Tilak, Orion, 166 et seq., and cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 145, n. 2. and the later literature. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 7, 4; v. 3, 1, 5; 7, 10, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 7, 7; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 4, 9 (Ma1dhyam2dina = i. 4, 4 Ka1n2va), etc., and cf. Av. viii. 6, 12; xi. 9, 22.

बहुवचन
बहु-वचन
 denotes in grammatical terminology the ‘plural’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 5, 1, 18. and the Nirukta. 2) v. 23; xi. 16; xii. 7 (which recognises the plural majestatis). So dvivat, bahuvat, in the Nirukta 3) ii. 24. 27; xi. 16. means ‘in the dual and the plural.’

बह्वृच
बह्व्-ऋच
 denotes an adherent of the Rigveda. The term is found in the Bra1hman2as 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 36; v. 2; vi. 18; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, vi. 11; xvi. 9. of the Rigveda, in the S4atapatha 2) x. 5, 2, 20; xi. 5, 1, 10. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2as, 3) v. 6, 6. and in the A1ran2yakas of the Rigveda. 4) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 3; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 4.

बाणवन्त्
बाणवन्त्
 in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (iii. 8, 2) denotes an ‘arrow’ like Ba1n2a. Its more normal sense is ‘quiver’ (lit., ‘containing arrows’), which is its sense in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (xvi. 10) and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (v. 3, 1, 11). 

बादरायण
बादरायण
 (‘descendant of Badara’) is the name of a teacher in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) at the end of the Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a. 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 377. Ba1dari is found in the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 3, 18; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 34, n.

In the legend of S4unah2s4epa 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17. The S4a1n3kha1yana version omits the words. the Ka1pileyas and the Ba1bhravas are enumerated as the descendants of S4unah2s4epa under his adoptive name of Devara1ta Vais4va1mitra. A Sa1man, or Chant, of Babhru is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 3) xv. 3, 12.

बाहीक
बाहीक
 is applied in the Satapatha Bra1hman2a 1) i. 7, 3, 8. to the people of the west, of the Panjab, 2) Cf. Maha1bha1rata, viii. 2030 et seq., where the Ba1hi1kas are defined as the people of the Panjab and the Indus. This coincides exactly with what seems to be meant by the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, which regards as the middle the land to the east of the Sarasvati1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 189; 2, 37; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 201, n 2. as opposed to the Pra1cyas or easterns. They are said to have called Agni by the name of Bhava.

 appears in one passage of the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 5, 6) to denote the plant Momordica monadelpha.

बिल्व
बिल्व
 is the name of the wood-apple tree (Aigle marmelos). It is mentioned in the Bra1hman2as 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 4, 8, etc. Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 9, 3. and in the Atharvaveda, 2) xx. 136, 13. where a reference to its valuable fruit may be intended. According to the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 3) ii. 1, 8, 1. 2. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 3, 20 (paridhayah2); Aitareya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. the sacrificial post was made of Bilva wood in some cases. The S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 4) xii. 20 et seq. contains a hymn in praise of the virtues of an amulet of Bilva (ira1-man2i bailva). 5) At the present day the tree is called Bel, and its leaves are used in the ritual of Siva worship.

बीज
बीज
 denotes ‘seed,’ the operation of sowing seed (vap) being several times referred to in the Rigveda 1) x. 94, 13; 101, 3. Cf. metaphorically, x. 85, 37. In v. 53, 13, dha1nya bi1ja means the ‘seed which produces corn.’ and later. 2) Av. x. 6, 33; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 2, 2, 4, etc. In a metaphorical sense the term is used in the Upanis2ads of the classes of beings according to origin, of which the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 3) vi. 3, 1. enumerates three, the Aitareya 4) iii. 3. See Keith. Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 235. four. The former list includes an2d2a-ja, ‘egg-born,’ ji1va-ja, ‘born alive,’ and udbhij-ja, ‘produced from sprouts,’ ‘germinating,’ while the latter adds sveda-ja, ‘sweat-born’--that is, ‘generated by hot moisture,’ an expression which is glossed to comprise flies, worms, etc. Cf. Kr2s2i.

बुडिलआश्वतराश्वि
बुडिल आश्वतराश्वि
 or A1s4vatara A1s4vi is mentioned several times in the Bra1hman2a literature as a teacher. According to the Cha1ndogya 1) v. 11, 1; 16, 1. and the Br2hada1ran2yaka 2) v. 15, 11 (Ma1dhyam2dina = v. 14, 8 Ka1n2va). Upanis2ads, he was a contemporary of Janaka of Videha, and, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) x. 6, 1, 1. Cf. iv. 6, 1, 9. vi. 30. of As4vapati, the Kekaya king. He is also mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a.^4

बुधसौमायन
बुध सौमायन,
 ‘descendant of Soma,’ is the name of a teacher mentioned in a verse in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxiv. 18, 6. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2.

बुन्द
बुन्द
 means ‘arrow’ in a few passages of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 45, 4; 77, 6. 11. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 32.

बृबु
बृबु
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 45, 31. 33. where he is described as a most generous giver (sahasra-da1tama), and as at the head of the Pan2is. According to the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 2) xvi. 11, 11. Bharadva1ja received gifts from Br2bu Taks2an and Prastoka Sa1rn5jaya, a fact alluded to in the Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra, 3) x. 107. where taks2an is treated as a descriptive attribute, ‘a carpenter.’ Apparently Br2bu was a Pan2i, though the words of the Rigveda 1) vi. 45, 31. 33. might be taken to mean that he was one who had overthrown them entirely. If so, Pan2i must here certainly mean a merchant in a good sense, Br2bu being then a merchant prince. 4) Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 606, n. According to Weber, 5) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 28 et seq.; Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 563, n. 1; Indische Studien, 17, 198. The Ba1veru Ja1taka, on which stress is laid in connexion with the Indian knowledge of Babylon, being of quite unknown date, has no cogency as evidence for any early period. Cf. Bu7hler, Indische Palœographie, 17-19; Indische Studien, 3, 79 et seq.; Weber, Indian Literature 3; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 201 et seq. the name suggests connexion with Babylon, but this conjecture must be regarded as quite improbable. Hillebrandt 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 93, 104, 107. sensibly expresses no opinion as to Br2bu, while Brunnhofer's 7) Iran und Turan, 127. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 275; Br2haddevata1, v. 108, 109, with Macdonell's notes; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 316. attempt to recognize a people named , and to connect them with the Vedic word taks2an, is valueless, especially considering the fact that Taks2an is not found as an epithet of Br2bu in the Rigveda.

बृसय
बृसय
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda, being in the first passage 1) i. 93, 4. connected with the Pan2is, and in the second 2) vi. 61, 3. with the Pa1ra1vatas and the Pan2is. According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the word is the name of a demon, 3) Cf. Sa1yan2a on Rv., loc., cit. but is in the second passage 2) vi. 61, 3. used as an appellative, perhaps meaning ‘sorcerer.’ 4) Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v., following Grassmann. Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 97-104. thinks that a people is meant locating them in Arachosia or Drangiana with the Pa1ra1vatas and the Pan2is, and comparing , satrap of Arachosia and Drangiana in the time of Darius. 6) Arrian, Indica, viii. 4; xxi. 1; xxv. 8. But this theory is not probable. 

बृसी
बृसी,
 denoting a ‘cushion’ of grass, is mentioned in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 1) i. 2, 4; v. 1, 3, with Keith's note; 3, 2. and the Su1tras. 2) S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xvii. 4, 7; 6, 6; Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, xiii. 3, 1. The incorrect forms Vr2s4i1 and Vr2s2i1 also occur occasionally.

बृहच्छन्दस्
बृहच्-छन्दस्
 is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 12, 3. as an epithet of S4a1la1, ‘house.’ It is apparently 2) Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 105. an error for br2had-chadis, ‘broad-roofed,’ which in any case is the sense. 3) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 345.

बृहत्सामन्
बृहत्-सामन्
 is mentioned in the Atharvaveda (v. 19, 2) as an A1n3girasa who was oppressed by Ks2atriyas. The latter are said to have been ruined in consequence. Cf. Sr2n5jaya and Ba1rhatsa1ma1.

बृहदुक्थ
बृहद्-उक्थ
 is mentioned in an obscure hymn of the Rigveda 1) v. 19, 3, where Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. treats it as adjectival. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft. 42, 214; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126. as a priest; in two hymns of the tenth Man2d2ala 2) x. 54, 6; 56, 7. he is definitely a R2s2i. He is also mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 3) viii. 23. as having consecrated Durmukha Pa1n5ca1la, and is called Va1madeva's son in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 4) xiii. 2, 2, 14. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 5) xiv. 9, 37, 38. he appears as Va1mneya, ‘descendant of Va1mni1.’ Hopkins 6) Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2. suggestion that he may have been there thought of as Va1madevya also is quite probable. 7) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiii. 9, 27, is parallel with xiv. 9, 38.

बृहद्गिरि
बृहद्-गिरि
 is said in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (viii. 1, 4) to have been one of the three Yatis who survived the slaughter of them by Indra. A Sa1man, or Chant, of his is mentioned in the same Bra1hman2a (xiii. 4, 15-17). 

बृहद्दिव
बृहद्-दिव
 appears in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 120, 8. 9. as its author, calling himself an Atharvan. He is mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 2) iv. 14. and is named in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 3) xv. 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 141. as a pupil of Sumnayu.

बृहद्रथ
बृहद्-रथ
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda, 1) i. 36, 18; x. 49, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147, 148. in both cases beside Navava1stva. The name may thus be an epithet of Navava1stva.

बृहद्वसु
बृहद्-वसु
 is the name of a teacher in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 374.

बृहस्पति
बृहस्पति,
 ‘lord of prayer,’ is the name of a god in the Vedic texts. The view of Thibaut, 1) Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik. 6. that the name designates the planet Jupiter, is certainly not supported by good evidence. Oldenberg 2) Nachrichten der ko7niglichen Gesellschaft der Wessenschaften zu Go7ttingen, 1909, 568, n. 3; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xciv, correcting Tilak, Orion, 101. See also Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1911, 514-518; Keith, ibid., 794-800. seems clearly right in rejecting it.

बृहस्पतिगुप्तशायस्थि
बृहस्पति-गुप्त शायस्थि
 is mentioned in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. as a pupil of Bhavatra1ta S4a1yasthi.

बृहस्पतिसव
बृहस्पति-सव
 is the name of a sacrifice by which, according to the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 1) ii. 7, 1, 2. Cf. Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 7; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 11, 4; xxv. 1, 1, 7. the priest who desired to become a Purohita obtained that office. According to the A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 2) ix. 9. 5. it was the sacrifice to be performed by a priest after the Va1japeya, while the king performed the Ra1jasu1ya. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) v. 2, 1, 19. on the other hand, the Br2haspatisava is identified with the Va1japeya; but such identity is clearly not primitive. 4) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, xxiv, xxv; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 107, 108.

बेकनाट
बेकनाट
 occurs only once in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 16, 10. when Indra is said to overcome all the Bekana1t2as and the Pan2is. The natural sense, therefore, seems to be ‘usurer,’ the explanation given by Ya1ska. 2) Niru1kta, vi. 26. The word has a foreign appearance, but its provenance can hardly be determined: it might just as well be aboriginal as Babylonian. 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 44. Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 268, n. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 259. thinks Brunnhofer is right in identifying Bekana1t2a with Bikanir.

बेकुरा
बेकुरा
 occurs in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) i. 3, 1; vi. 7, 6; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 82. where it may mean ‘voice’ or ‘sound,’ the sense assigned to the word in the Naighan2t2uka. 2) i. 11. It is, however, possibly, like Bakura, the name of a musical instrument. In the Taittiri1ya 3) iii. 4, 7, 1. and the Ka1t2haka 4) xviii. 14. Sam2hita1s the words Bekuri and Vekuri occur as epithets of Apsarases, or celestial nymphs, meaning, perhaps, ‘melodious’; in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 5) xviii. 42. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 6) ix. 4, 1, 9. the variations Bhakuri and Bha1kuri are found.

बैजवाप

 is the name of one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 16; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 12, 1. According to the commentator Mahi1dhara, the word denotes a Nis2a1da, but according to Sa1yan2a a catcher of fish. See Mr2gayu.

बोध
बोध
 is the name of a R2s2i in the Mantra Pa1t2ha. 1) ii. 16, 14. Cf. Winternitz, Mantrapa1t2ha, xiv. He is mentioned with Pratibodha in the Atharvaveda, 2) v. 30, 10; viii. 1, 13. but Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 474. thinks that in the second passage, at least, the word is an ordinary noun meaning ‘the wakeful one.’

बौधायन
बौधायन,
 ‘descendant of Budha or Bodha,’ is the name of a teacher who is mentioned in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 1) iv. 11, etc. and under whose name are current a S4rauta Su1tra described 2) U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 1903. and in part edited by Caland, 3) Bibliotheca Indica, 1904, etc. and a Dharma Su1tra which has been edited 4) By Hultzsch, Leipzig, 1884. and translated, 5) Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14. See his Introduction, xxix et seq., where, however, he tends to overestimate considerably the age of Baudha1yana. while the Gr2hya Su1tra is still unedited.

बौधीपुत्र
बौधी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Bodha,’ is the name of a pupil of S4a1lan3ka1yani1putra in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Ma1dhyam2dina recension of the Br2hada1ranyaka Upanis2ad (vi. 4, 31).

ब्रह्मचर्य
ब्रह्म-चर्य
 denotes the condition of life of the Brahmaca1rin 1) Rv. x. 109, 5; Av. vi. 108, 2; 133, 3; xi. 5, 1 et seq.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 3, 1, etc. or religious student. The technical sense is first found in the last Man2d2ala of the Rigveda. 2) Rv., loc. cit. The practice of studentship doubtless developed, and was more strictly regulated by custom as time went on, but it is regularly assumed and discussed in the later Vedic literature, being obviously a necessary part of Vedic society The Atharvaveda 3) xi. 5. Cf. Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 1-8, which contains an independent account of the Brahmaca1rin (Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 110); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 3, 1 et seq.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 3, 10, 5. has in honour of the Brahmaca1rin a hymn which already gives all the characteristic features of religious studentship. The youth is initiated (upa-ni1) by the teacher 4) Av. xi. 5, 3. It is used in the ritual of the Upanayana, according to the Kaus4ika Su1tra, lv. 18. into a new life; he wears an antelope skin, and lets his hair grow long; 5) Av. xi. 5, 6. he collects fuel, 6) Av. xi. 5, 4, 6. and begs, 7) Av. xi. 5, 9. learns, and practises penance. All these characteristics appear in the later literature. The student lives in the house of his teacher (a1ca1rya-kula-va1sin; 8) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, ii. 23, 2. So regularly brahma-caryen2a vas, Av. vii. 109, 7; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 14, etc.; or car, S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 3, 7; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, 6, 3, etc. ante-va1sin); 9) Ibid., iii. 11, 5; iv. 10, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 15 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 3, 7 Ka1n2va); Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, i. 3, 3; 11. 1. he begs, 10) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 5. Cf. Av. vi. 133, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 3, 5. looks after the sacrificial fires, 11) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 10, 2 et seq.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. xi. 3, 3, 4. and tends the house. 12) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 6, 2, 15. A Mantra in the A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 22, 1. 2, and elsewhere, sums up the duties of the Brahmaca1rin as ‘thou art a Brahmaca1rin: eat water; perform thy duty; sleep not in the daytime; obedient to thy teacher study the Veda (brahmaca1ry asy; apo ‘s4a1na; karma kuru; diva1 ma1 sva1psi1r; a1ca1rya1ya1dhi1no vedam adhi1s2va).’ One duty specially referred to in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 1, 6; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, vii. 19, and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 5, 5, was the guarding of the teacher's cattle when they were grazing on their pasture grounds. From these grounds, too, the pupil would, no doubt, bring dried dung for fuel, as well as any available sticks. As regards obedience to the teacher, cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 3, 6. His term of studentship might be long extended: it was normally fixed at twelve years, 13) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 10; vi. 1, 2. but much longer periods, such as thirty-two years, are mentioned. 14) Ibid., viii. 7, 3 (thirty-two years); 15 (for life), etc. The age at which studentship began varied. 15) See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 21. The Su1tras allowed for a Bra1hman2a the ages 8-16; for a Ks2atriya, 11-22; for a Vais4ya, 12-24. The difference between the Bra1hman2a and the Ks2atriya, compared with that between the Ks2atriya and the Vais4ya, shows that the two latter castes were in a different position from the Bra1hman2a. S4vetaketu commenced at twelve and studied for twelve years. 16) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 2. It is assumed in the Gr2hya Su1tras that the three A1ryan castes were all required to pass through a period of studentship. But that this is much more than priestly schematism is uncertain. No doubt individuals of the Ks2atriya or Vais4ya caste might go through part of the period of studentship, just as Burmese boys of all classes now pass some time in a monastery as students. This is borne out by the reference in the Atharvaveda 17) xv. 5, 17. Cf. Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 639. to the king guarding his country by Brahmacarya--though that is susceptible of a different interpretation--and more clearly by the reference in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 18) ix. 16 (reading abra1hman2a) . to a rite intended to benefit one who, although not a Brahmin, had studied (vidya1m anu1cya), but had not gained renown, and by references in the Upanis2ads to kings who like Janaka studied the Vedas and the Upanis2ads. 19) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 2, 1. Normally, however, the Ks2atriya studied the art of war. 20) Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 106-113. One of the duties of the Brahmaca1rin was chastity. But reference is in several places 21) Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, x. 65; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 10, 9. made to the possibility of misconduct between a student and the wife of his preceptor, nor is any very severe penance imposed in early times--later it is different--for such a sin. In certain cases the ritual required a breach of chastity, no doubt as a magic spell to secure fertility. 22) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 5; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 9, 4; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 125, n. 1; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 79. Even an old man might on occasion become a pupil, as the story of A1run2i shows. 23) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 6 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 2, 4 Ka1n2va).

Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, 9, 2. ‘oppressor of a Brahmin,’ and Brahma-jyeya, 2) Av. xii. 4, 11. ‘oppression of a Brahmin,’ are terms mentioned several times in the Atharvaveda as expressing a heinous crime which involves its perpetrator in ruin. See Bra1hman2a.

ब्रह्मदत्तचैकितानेय
ब्रह्म-दत्त चैकितानेय
 (‘descendant of Cekita1na’) is the name of a teacher in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (i. 3, 26). He is mentioned also in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad (i. 38, 1; 59, 1) as patronized by Abhiprata1rin, the Kuru king.

ब्रह्मन्
1. Brahman (neut.) denotes the priestly class as opposed to the warrior class and the people (Ks2atra and Vis4). The term is found in the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 15, 4; ix. 7, 9; xii. 5, 8; xv. 10, 3, 4. and repeatedly later on. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 1, 1, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vi. 3; vii. 21, etc. See also Varn2a and Ks2atra. For the position, etc., of this class, see Bra1hman2a.

ब्रह्मन्
2. Brahman is found in many passages of the Rigveda and later in the sense of ‘priest.’ In many passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 80, 1; 164, 34; ii. 2, 6; vi. 45, 7; vii. 33, 11; viii. 16, 7; x. 71, 11; 77, 1; 85, 3, 16. 34; 107, 6; 117, 7; 125, 5; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 244-246. he is referred to as praising the gods; in others 2) i. 10, 1; 33, 9; 101, 5; 108, 7; 158, 6; ii. 39, 1; iv. 50, 8, 9; 58, 2; v. 29, 3; 31, 4; 32, 12; 40, 8; vii. 7, 5; 42, 1; viii. 7, 20; 17, 2; 31, 1; 32, 16; 33 19; 45, 39; 64, 7; 77, 5; 92, 30; 96, 5; ix. 96, 6; 112, 1; 113, 6; x. 28 11; 71, 11; 85, 29; 141, 3; Muir, op. cit., 12, 246-251. the sense of ‘priest’ is adequate. In not a few cases 3) i. 108, 7; iv. 50, 8, 9; viii. 7, 20; 45, 39; 64, 7; 92, 30; ix. 112, 1; x. 85, 29; Muir, 12, 258. the priesthood as a profession is clearly alluded to, nor is there any reason to doubt 4) Loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 190 et seq. that in all cases the word has the technical sense of a member of the priesthood. There is, however, considerable doubt as to the number of cases in the Rigveda, where it has the technical sense of the priest who guides the sacrifice generally. It is undoubtedly found in that sense, both Muir 5) Op. cit., 12, 251, citing ii. 1, 2 (= ix. 91, 10); iv. 9, 4; x. 52, 2. and Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2, citing ii. 1, 2; ix. 96, 6; x. 71, 11; 107, 6. In none of the last three passages is the specific sense cogently required. recognizing instances of its being used thus. Geldner, 7) Vedische Studien, 2, 145 et seq.; 3, 155. He thinks that the sense of ‘superintending priest’ is the older, and sees it in i. 158, 6; iv. 9, 4; 50, 7. 8; vii. 7, 5; 33, 11; x. 141, 3, etc. however, is anxious to find that sense in a large number of passages, and insists that the Purohita was normally a Brahman in the narrower sense. Oldenberg, 8) Religion des Veda, 396, 397, who thinks that the Brahman priest known to the Rigveda was the Bra1hman2a1ccham2sin and who in most passages (e.g., iv. 50, 7. 8) sees only the sense of ‘priest.’ Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 376, 377. on the other hand, holds with greater probability that in most of the passages adduced Brahman means simply ‘priest,’ and that the Purohita, who was essentially not a member of the ordinary body of sacrificing priests (R2tvij), was, when he officiated at the sacrifice, more usually the Hotr2 priest, and only later became the Brahman. This change he regards as having taken place when the importance of the hymns declined, and most weight was laid on the functions of the priest who superintended the sacrifice as a whole, and by his magic repaired the flaws in the sacrifice. 9) Cf. Pischel, Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1894, 420; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 13; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, lxviii; Atharvaveda, 32; and see Purohita. In the later literature both senses of the word are quite common. 10) As ‘priest,’ Av. ii. 7, 2; iv. 35, 1. 2; v. 8, 5; 17, 8; 18, 7; 19, 8; vi. 122, 5; viii. 9, 3; x. 1, 3; 4, 30. 33; 7, 24; xi. 1, 25; xii. 1, 38; xix. 32, 8; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 7, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxvi. 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 3, etc. As ‘superintending priest,’ Av. xviii. 4, 15; xx. 2, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 9, 1; ii. 3, 11, 4; iii. 5, 2, 1, etc.; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 17; and see Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 34, 35; 114; 135-138; 327; 330-337.

 is found in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 1) xix. 10; xxvii. 4. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xii. 8, 3, 29. where the St. Petersburg Dictionary gives the sense as ‘having the priesthood as its Purohita.’ This seems rather doubtful; more probably the sense should be ‘having a Brahman priest as Purohita,’ unless the word merely means ‘having the priesthood superior to it,’ as an epithet of Ks2atra, the ‘warrior caste,’ which seems to be Weber's view. 3) Indische Studien, 10, 30.

ब्रह्मबन्धु
ब्रह्म-बन्धु
 (‘priest fellow’) denotes, in a deprecatory sense, an ‘unworthy priest,’ ‘priest in name only,’ in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 27. and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 2) vi. 1, 1. Cf.

Bra1hman2a, ‘descendant of a Brahman’ (i.e., of a priest), is found only a few times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 164, 45; vi. 75, 10; vii. 103, 1. 7. 8; x. 16, 6; 71, 8. 9; 88, 19; 90, 12; 97, 22; 109, 4. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 251-257; Roth, Nirukta, Erla7uterungen, 126; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., where Rv. viii. 58, 1, is added; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 220-226. and mostly in its latest parts. In the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 1; v. 17, 9; 18, 1 et seq.; 19, 2 et seq.; xi. 1, 28; xix. 34, 6; 35, 2, etc. and later 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 7, 2; ii. 1, 2, 8, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vii. 46. etc. it is a very common word denoting ‘priest,’ and it appears in the quadruple division of the castes in the Purus2a-su1kta (‘hymn of man’) of the Rigveda. 4) x. 90. It seems certain that in the Rigveda this Bra1hman2a, or Brahmin, is already a separate caste, differing from the warrior and agricultural castes. 5) Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 235; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 146, n. 1; and see Varn2a. The texts regularly claim for them a superiority to the Ks2atriya caste, 6) See Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxix. 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 21; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 15; xiii. 1, 9, 1; 3, 7, 8; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 15; viii. 9; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ii. 8, 2; xi. 11; 9; xv. 6, 3; and cf. Brahmapurohita; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 27 et seq. and the Brahmin is able by his spells or manipulation of the rite to embroil the people and the warriors 7) See Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 7; iii. 3, 10; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 11, 2, etc. or the different sections of the warriors. 8) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 10. If it is necessary to recognize, as is sometimes done, that the Brahmin does pay homage to the king at the Ra1jasu1ya, 9) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 4, 23 (Ma1dhyam2dina = i. 4, 11 Ka1n2va). Cf. Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 3, 2; v. 4, 2, 7. Contrast the claim that Soma alone is King of the Brahmins, Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 18; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 2, 3. nevertheless the unusual fact is carefully explained away so as to leave the priority of the Brahmin unaffected. But it is expressly recognized that the union of the Ks2atriya and the Bra1hman2a is essential for complete prosperity. 10) See Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 10, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xix. 10; xxvii. 4; xxix. 10; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 3; 7, 7; iii. 1, 9; 2, 3; iv. 3, 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 25; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xix. 17, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 4, 6; v. 4, 4, 15; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 10. 17, 24, 25, etc. Cf. Purohita. It is admitted 11) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 8, 7; Pan5cavims4a Bra1hman2a, xviii. 10, 8; Av. v. 1719; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 2, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 1, 5, 4. that the king or the nobles might at times oppress the Brahmins, but it is indicated that ruin is then certain swiftly to follow. The Brahmins are gods on earth, 12) Av. v. 3, 2; vi. 13, 1; 44, 2; xix. 62, 1 (compared with xix. 32, 8), and probably v. 11, 11; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 7, 3, 1; ii. 5, 9, 6; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 2, 6; 4, 3, 14; iii. 1, 1, 11; iv. 3, 4, 4. See Weber, op. cit., 10, 35, 36; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 146, 147. like the gods in heaven, but this claim is hardly found in the Rigveda. 13) Neither in i. 139, 7, nor ix. 99, 6 (see Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, (s.v. deva), is this sense at all probable. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 206, quotes 1, 128, 8, but that also is uncertain. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 14) vii. 29, 2. Cf. Varn2a. n. 71. the Brahmin is said to be the ‘recipient of gifts’ (a1da1yi1) and the ‘drinker of the offering’ (a1pa1yi1). The other two epithets applied, a1vasa1yi1 and yatha1ka1ma-praya1pya, are more obscure; the former denotes either ‘dwelling everywhere’ 15) Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 326. or ‘seeking food’; 16) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 439. the latter is usually taken as ‘moving at pleasure,’ but it must rather allude to the power of the king to assign a place of residence to the Brahmin. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 17) xi. 5, 7, 1 et seq. See Weber, op. cit., 10, 41 et seq. the prerogatives of the Brahmin are summed up as (1) Arca1, ‘honour’; (2) Da1na, ‘gifts’; (3) Ajyeyata1, ‘freedom from oppression’; and (4) Avadhyata1, ‘freedom from being killed.’ On the other hand, his duties are summed up as (5) Bra1hman2ya, ‘purity of descent’; (6) Pratiru1pa-carya1, ‘devotion of the duties of his caste’; and (7) Loka-pakti, ‘the perfecting of people’ (by teaching). 1. Respect paid to Brahmins.--The texts are full 18) E.g., Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1; xxv. 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 10, 6; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 1, 10; 3, 4, 6, etc. of references to the civilities to be paid to the Brahmin. He is styled bhagavant, 19) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 6, 1, 2. and is provided with good food 20) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xix. 12. and entertainment wherever he goes. Indeed, his sanctity exempts him from any close inquiry into his real claim to Brahminhood according to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 21) vi. 5, 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvii. 2. 2. Gifts to Brahmins.--The Da1nastuti (‘Praise of gifts’) is a recognized feature of the Rigveda, and the greed of the poets for Daks2in2a1s, or sacrificial fees, is notorious. Vedic texts 22) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiv. 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 2, 6, 7. themselves recognize that the literature thence resulting (Na1ra1 s4am2si1) was often false to please the donors. It was, however, a rule 23) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 1, 25. Cf. also Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 15, 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 3, 14, etc. that Brahmins should not accept what had been refused by others; this indicates a keen sense of the danger of cheapening their wares. So exclusively theirs was the right to receive gifts that the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 24) xiii. 7, 12. has to explain how Taranta and Purumi1l2ha became able to accept gifts by composing a Rigvedic hymn. 25) ix. 58, 3. The exaggerations in the celebration of the gifts bestowed on the priests has the curious result of giving us a series of numerals of some interest (Das4an). In some passages 26) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 12, 1. 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 6, etc. certain gifts--those of a horse or sheep--are forbidden, but this rule was not, it is clear, generally observed. 3. Immunities of Brahmins.--The Brahmin claimed to be exempt from the ordinary exercise of the royal power. When a king gives all his land and what is on it to the priests, the gift does not cover the property of the Brahmin according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 27) xiii. 5, 4, 29; 6, 2, 18; 7, 1, 13. The king censures all, but not the Brahmin, 28) Ibid., v. 4, 2, 3. nor can he safely oppress any Brahmin other than an ignorant priest. 29) Ibid., xiii. 4, 2, 17. An arbitrator (or a witness) must decide (or speak) for a Brahmin against a non-Brahmin in a legal dispute. 30) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 11, 9. The Brahmin's proper food is the Soma, 31) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 7, 2, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 29. Cf. Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 40; x. 18, etc. not Sura1 32) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 8, 1,--5. or Parisrut, 33) Ibid., xii. 9, 1, 1. and he is forbidden to eat certain forms of flesh. 34) Ibid., 1, 2, 3, 9; vii. 5, 2, 37; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 8. On the other hand, he alone is allowed to eat the remains of the sacrifice, 35) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 1, 39; 5, 3, 16, etc. On the food of the Brahmins, cf. also Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, x. 4, 5; xvii. 1, 9; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 11. for no one else is sufficiently holy to consume food which the gods have eaten. Moreover, though he cannot be a physician, 36) Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 8-14, where the As4vins, who are famous as physicians (viii. 2, 1, 3; xii. 7, 1, 11). are treated as impure. he helps the physician by being beside him while he exercises his art. 37) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 9, 3. Contrast Rv. x. 97, 22, where no discredit attaches to the profession. His wife 38) Av. v. 17. and his cow 39) Ibid., v. 18. are both sacred. 4. Legal Position of Brahmins.--The Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 40) ii. 6, 10. 2. lays down a penalty of a hundred (the unit meant is unknown) for an insult to a Brahmin, and of a thousand for a blow; but if his blood is drawn, the penalty is a spiritual one. The only real murder is the slaying of a Brahmin according to the Satapatha Bra1hman2a. 41) xiii. 3, 5, 3. The crime of slaying a Brahmin ranks above the sin of killing any other man, but below that of killing an embryo (bhru1n2a) in the Yajurveda; 42) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxi. 7; Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1, xlvii. 7; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 12. the crime of slaying an embryo whose sex is uncertain is on a level with that of slaying a Brahmin. 43) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 10, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvii. 9; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 481; 10, 66. The murder of a Brahmin can be expiated only by the horse sacrifice, 44) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 1, 1; 5, 4, 1 et seq. or by a lesser rite in the late Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 45) x. 38. The ritual slaying of a Brahmin is allowed in the later ceremonial, 46) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 10, 10; 12, 16-20; Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 18, 268, 269. and hinted at in the curious legend of S4unah2s4epa; 47) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 15; Sa1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 20. and a Purohita might be punished with death for treachery to his master. 48) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 6, 8. 5. Purity of Birth.--The importance of pure descent is seen in the stress laid on being a descendant of a R2s2i (a1rs2eya). 49) See Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 6, 1, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vii. 46; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 4, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 4, 19; xii. 4, 4, 6. But, on the other hand, there are clear traces of another doctrine, which requires learning, and not physical descent, as the true criterion of R2s2ihood. 50) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 6, 1, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxx. 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 8, 1. In agreement with this is the fact that Satyaka1ma Ja1ba1la was received as a pupil, though his parentage was unknown, his mother being a slave girl who had been connected with several men, 51) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 4. and that in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 52) xi. 5, 4, 1; and cf. a citation in the scholiast on Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 6, 14; ‘Whoever studies the Stomabha1gas (a peculiarity of the Vasis2t2has) is a Vasis2t2ha’; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 73. the ceremony on acceptance as a pupil required merely the name of the pupil. So Kavas2a is taunted in the Rigveda Bra1hman2as 53) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 19; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xii. 3; Weber, op. cit., 2, 311. as being the son of a female slave (Da1si1), and Vatsa cleared himself of a similar imputation by a fire ordeal. 54) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 6, 6. Moreover, a very simple rite was adequate to remove doubts as to origin. 55) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 6, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiii. 4, 2. In these circumstances it is doubtful whether much value attaches to the Pravara lists in which the ancestors of the priest were invoked at the beginning of the sacrifice by the Hotr2 and the Adhvaryu priests. 56) See Weber, op. cit., 9, 321; 10, 8. 81; Max Mu7ller. Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 380 et seq. Still, in many parts of the ritual the knowledge of two or more generations was needed, 57) Cf., e.g., Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 5, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 5. and in one ceremony 58) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 5, 4; Weber, op. cit., 10, 85-88. ten ancestors who have drunk the Soma are required, but a literal performance of the rite is excused. Moreover, there are clear traces of ritual variations in schools, like those of the Vasis2t2has and the Vis4va1mitras. 6. The Conduct of the Brahmin.--The Brahmin was required to maintain a fair standard of excellence. 59) Weber, 10, 88-96; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 407 et seq. He was to be kind to all 60) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. ii. 3, 2, 12. and gentle, 61) Ibid., ii. 3, 4, 6. offering sacrifice and receiving gifts. 62) Ibid., xiii. 1, 5, 6. Especial stress was laid on purity of speech; 63) Ibid., iii. 2, 1, 24. Cf. iv. 1, 3, 17; Nirukta, xiii. 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiv. 5; xxxvii. 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 62. thus Vis4vantara's excuse for excluding the S4ya1parn2as from his retinue was their impure (apu1ta1) speech. 64) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 27; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 438. Theirs was the craving for knowledge 65) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 8, 8; v. 1, 1. and the life of begging. 66) Ibid., iii. 4, 1; iv. 4, 26. False Brahmins are those who do not fulfil their duties 67) Ibid., vi. 4, 4. (cf. Brahmabandhu) . But the penances for breach of duty are, in the Su1tras, of a very light and unimportant character. 68) Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 18, etc. 7. Brahminical Studies.--The aim of the priest is to obtain pre-eminence in sacred knowledge (brahma-varcasam), as is stated in numerous passages of Vedic literature. 69) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 7, 1; vii. 5, 18, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, As4vamedha, v. 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 22; xxvii. 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 13, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 11, 6-9; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 6, 10; x. 3, 5, 16; xi. 4, 4, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 3, 5. Such distinction is not indeed confined to the Brahmin: the king has it also, but it is not really in a special manner appropriate to the Ks2atriya. 70) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 3, 6; xiii. 1, 5, 3, 5; 2, 6, 9. Many ritual acts are specified as leading to Brahmavarcasa, 71) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 7; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 1, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiii. 7, 3, etc.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 1, 31, etc. but more stress is laid on the study of the sacred texts: the importance of such study is repeatedly insisted upon. 72) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 2, 3; xi. 3, 3, 3-6; 5, 7, 10. The technical name for study is Sva1dhya1ya: the Satapatha Bra1hman2a is eloquent upon its advantages, 73) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 6, 3, 9; 7, 1; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 13. and it is asserted that the joy of the learned S4rotriya, or ‘student,’ is equal to the highest joy possible. 74) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 35-39; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ix. 8. Na1ka Maudgalya held that study and the teaching of others were the true penance (tapas). 75) Ibid., vii. 8. 10. The object was the ‘threefold knowledge’ (trayi1 vidya1), that of the R2c, Yajus, and Sa1man, 76) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 2. 3; ii. 6, 4, 2-7; iv. 6, 7, 1, 2; v. 5, 5, 9; vi. 3, 1, 10. 11. 20; x. 5, 2, 1. 2; xi. 5, 4, 18; xii. 3, 3, 2, etc. a student of all three Vedas being called tri-s4ukriya 77) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 7. or tri-s4ukra, 78) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 1, 2. ‘thrice pure.’ Other objects of study are enumerated in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 79) xi. 5, 7, 5-8. in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, 80) ii. 9. 10. the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 81) vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. etc. (See Itiha1sa, Pura1n2a; Ga1tha1, Na1ra1s4am2si1; Brahmodya; Anus4a1sana, Anuvya1khya1na, Anva1khya1na, Kalpa, 2. Bra1hman2a; Vidya1, Ks2atravidya1, Devajanavidya1, Naks2atravidya1, Bhu1tavidya1, Sarpavidya1; Atharva1n3girasah2, Daiva, Nidhi, Pitrya, Ra1s4i; Su1tra, etc.) Directions as to the exact place and time of study are given in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 82) ii. 11. 12-15. and in the Su1tras. If study is carried on in the village, it is to be done silently (manasa1); if outside, aloud (va1ca1). Learning is expected even from persons not normally competent as teachers, such as the Carakas, who are recognized in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 83) iv. 2, 4. 1. as possible sources of information. Here, too, may be mentioned the cases of Brahmins learning from princes, though their absolute value is doubtful, for the priests would naturally represent their patrons as interested in their sacred science: it is thus not necessary to see in these notices any real and independent study on the part of the Ks2atriyas. 84) Cf. (1) Ks2atriya and (2) Varn2a. Ya1jn5avalkya learnt from Janaka, 85) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 2, 5. Udda1laka A1run2i and two other Brahmins from Prava1han2a Jaivali, 86) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 11; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 3, 1, and i. 8, 1. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5. 436, 514-516. Dr2ptaba1la1ki Ga1rgya from Aja1tas4atru, 87) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanisad, ii. 1, 1; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 1. and five Brahmins under the lead of Arun2a from As4vapati Kaikeya. 88) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 1, 2. A few notices show the real educators of thought: wandering scholars went through the country 89) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 3, 1. Cf. iii. 7, 1. and engaged in disputes and discussions in which a prize was staked by the disputants. 90) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 4, 1, 1. Moreover, kings like Janaka offered rewards to the most learned of the Brahmins; 91) Ibid., xi. 6, 3, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 1-9, 20. 29. Aja1tas4atru was jealous of his renown, and imitated his generosity. Again, learned women are several times mentioned in the Bra1hman2as. 92) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 29; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, ii. 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 3, 1; 7, 1. Cf. A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 4, 4; Sa1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 10. A special form of disputation was the Brahmodya, for which there was a regular place at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) 93) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 2, 11. and at the Das4ara1tra (‘ten-day festival’). 94) Ibid., iv. 6, 9, 20. The reward of learning was the gaining of the title of Kavi or Vipra, ‘sage.’ 95) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 9, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 3, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 2. 7; iii. 5, 3, 12. Cf. also Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanisad, vi. 4, 29. 8. The Functions of the Brahmin.--The Brahmin was required not merely to practise individual culture, but also to give others the advantage of his skill, either as a teacher or as a sacrificial priest, or as a Purohita. As a teacher the Brahmin has, of course, the special duty of instructing his own son in both study and sacrificial ritual. 96) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 2, 4. The texts give examples of this, such as A1run2i and S4vetaketu, 97) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 1. (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 2, 1 Ka1n2va). or mythically Varun2a and Bhr2gu. 98) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 1, 1. This fact also appears from some of the names in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 99) Indische Studien, 4, 376. of the Sa1maveda and the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka. 100) xv. 1. On the other hand, these Vam2s4as and the Vam2s4as of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a show that a father often preferred to let his son study under a famous teacher. The relation of pupil and teacher is described under Brahmacarya. A teacher might take several pupils, 101) Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, vii. 3. and he was bound to teach them with all his heart and soul. 102) See Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, vii. 4 (Indische Studien, 2, 211). He was bound to reveal everything to his pupil, at any rate to one who was staying with him for a year (sam2vatsara-va1sin), 103) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 1, 26. 27. Cf. Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 3, 3. an expression which shows, as was natural, that a pupil might easily change teachers. But, nevertheless, certain cases of learning kept secret and only revealed to special persons are enumerated. 104) So the Vasis2t2has and the Stomabha1gas, Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xv. 5, 24; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 2, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 17; Prava1han2a Jaivali and his knowledge of Brahman, Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 11; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 3, where the claim is made that the pras4a1sana belongs to the Ks2atriyas. S4an3kara, in his commentary, takes the word to mean the ‘giving of instruction,’ but this must be regarded as improbable, ‘rule’ being more probably the sense. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 128; Bo7htlingk, Translation of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 8, 9. The exact times and modes of teaching are elaborately laid down in the Su1tras, 105) Rigveda Pra1tis4a1khya, xv. 1 et seq.; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 3, 3; and see Weber, op. cit., 10, 129-135. but not in the earlier texts. As priest the Brahmin operated in all the greater sacrifices; the simple domestic (gr2hya) rites could normally be performed without his help, but not the more important rites (s4rauta). The number varied: the ritual literature requires sixteen priests to be employed at the greatest sacrifices (see R2tvij), but other rites could be accomplished with four, 106) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 6, 1-4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 4, 2. The four are the Hotr2, Adhvaryu, Agni1dh, and Upavaktr2: Weber, 10, 139, n. 4. five, 107) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 13; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 4, 2, with a second Adhvaryu, as well as the four enumerated in the previous note. six, 108) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 13; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 2, 3; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iii. 4, 6; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 7, 2, 6, where the list has Adhvaryu, Hotr2, Brahman, with the Pratiprastha1tr2, Maitra1varun2a, A1gni1dhra. seven, 109) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 13; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 2, 5; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iii. 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 4, 2. The number seems to be made up of the five of note 107 and the Abhigarau--i.e., probably the Abhigara and the Apagara. or ten 110) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita, ix. 8, 13-16; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 4, 1; 3, 6, 4; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iii. 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 25; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 4, 2. What ten are meant is uncertain; the four of note 106 are enumerated. priests. Again, the Kaus2i1takins 111) Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 4, 2, 19; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 37. had a seventeenth priest beside the usual sixteen, the Sadasya, so called because he watched the performance from the Sadas, ‘seat.’ In one rite, the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’) of the serpents, the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 112) xxv. 14, 3. adds three more to the sixteen, a second Unnetr2, an Abhigara, and an Apagara. The later ritual places the Brahman at the head of all the priests, but this is probably not the early view (see Brahman). The sacrifice ensured, if properly performed, primarily the advantages of the sacrificer (yajama1na), 113) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 1, 20; 9, 1, 12; ii. 2, 2, 7; iii. 4, 2, 15; iv. 2, 5, 9, 10; viii. 5, 3, 8; ix. 5, 2, 16; xii. 8, 1, 17, etc. but the priest shared in the profit, besides securing the Daks2in2a1s. Disputes between sacrificers and the priests were not rare, as in the case of Vis4vantara and the S4ya1parn2as, 114) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 27 et seq.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 436 et seq. or Janamejaya and the Asitamr2gas; 115) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 27. and the Ais2a1vi1ras are referred to as undersirable priests. 116) Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 2, 7, 32, where Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 153, n. 1, interprets Ais2a1vi1ra, not as a proper name, but as meaning ‘contemptible’; but Sa1yan2a thinks a proper name is meant, a view accepted by Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 45, n. 2. Moreover, Vis4va1mitra once held the post of Purohita to Suda1s, but gave place to Vasis2t2ha. The position of Purohita differed considerably from that of the ordinary priest, for the Purohita not merely might officiate at the sacrifice, but was the officiator in all the private sacrifices of his king. Hence he could, and undoubtedly sometimes did, obtain great influence over his master in matters of secular importance; and the power of the priesthood in political as opposed to domestic and religious matters, no doubt rested on the Purohita. There is no recognition in Vedic literature of the rule later prevailing by which, after spending part of his life as a Brahmaca1rin, and part as a householder, the Brahmin became an ascetic 117) See Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 372 et seq. (later divided into the two stages of Va1naprastha, ‘forest-dweller,’ and Sam2nya1sin, ‘mystic’). Ya1jn5avalkya's case 118) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 4, 1; iv. 5, 1. See iii. 5, 1, for his teaching, of which his action is a logical consequence. shows that study of the Absolute might empty life of all its content for the sage, and drive him to abandon wife and family. In Buddhist times the same phenomenon is seen 119) Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 40 et seq.; Oldenberg, Buddha,^5 72 et seq. applying to other than Brahmins. The Buddhist texts are here confirmed in some degree by the Greek authorities. 120) Arrian, Indica, xii. 8. 9; Strabo, xv. 1, 49, 60. The practice bears a certain resemblance to the habit of kings, in the Epic tradition, 121) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 179 et seq. of retiring to the forest when active life is over. From the Greek authorities 122) See Fick, loc. cit. it also appears--what is certainly the case in the Buddhist literature 123) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 57. --that Brahmins practised the most diverse occupations. It is difficult to say how far this was true for the Vedic period. The analogy of the Druids 124) Cæsar, Bellum Gallicum, vi. 14. The Druids did not fight, did not pay tribute, studied for many years, observed secrecy as to matters of ritual and learning, did not use writing, and had a certain belief in transmigration. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 19. --in some respects very close--suggests that the Brahmins may have been mainly confined to their professional tasks, including all the learned professions such as astronomy 125) Hence the Brahman is the 28th Naks2atra: Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 3, 3; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 306, 311; Indische Studien, 10, 40. and so forth. This is not contradicted by any Vedic evidence, for instance, the poet of a hymn of the Rigveda 126) ix. 112. says he is a poet, his father a physician (Bhis2aj), and his mother a grinder of corn (Upala-praks2in2i1). This would seem to show that a Brahmin could be a doctor, while his wife would perform the ordinary household duties. So a Purohita could perhaps take the field to assist the king by prayer, as Vis4va1mitra, 127) Rv. iii. 33. 53. and later on Vasis2t2ha 128) Rv. vii. 18. do, but this does not show that priests normally fought. Nor do they seem normally to have been agriculturists or merchants. On the other hand, they kept cattle: a Brahmaca1rin's duty was to watch his master's cattle. 129) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 4, 5; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 1, 6. It is therefore needless to suppose that they could not, and did not, on occasion turn to agricultural or mercantile pursuits, as they certainly did later. But it must be remembered that in all probability there was more purity of blood, and less pressure of life, among the Brahmins of the Vedic age than later in Buddhist times, when the Vedic sacrificial apparatus was falling into grave disrepute. It is clear that the Brahmins, whatever their defects, represented the intellectual side of Vedic life, and that the Ks2atriyas, if they played a part in that life, did so only in a secondary degree, and to a minor extent. It is natural to suppose that the Brahmins also composed ballads, the precursors of the epic; for though none such have survived, a few stanzas of this character, celebrating the generosity of patrons, have been preserved by being embedded in priestly compositions. A legend in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 130) i. 4, 1, 14-17. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 257, 277, 278, and Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 44. Almost all that can be said of the Brahmins is collected in Weber's Indische Studien, 10, 40-158. Cf. also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 220-226; Fick, Die sociale Gliederung (for Buddhist times; the evidence is, however, of uncertain, and much of it probably of late, date); Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 82, 182, etc. (for notices of the Brahmins in the Epic): The Mutual Relations of the Four Castes according to the Ma1navadharmaca1stram (for the Dharma view). Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 248 et seq., discusses the priesthood in the Rigveda, and Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 197212, gives an excellent summary of the facts. shows clearly that the Brahmins regarded civilization as being spread by them only: Kosala and Videha, no doubt settled by A1ryan tribes, are only rendered civilized and habitable by the influence of pious Brahmins. We need not doubt that the non-Brahminical tribes (see Vra1tya) had attained intellectual as well as material civilization, but it is reasonable to assume that their civilization was inferior to that of the Brahmins, for the history of Hinduism is the conquest by the Brahmins--not by arms, but by mind--of the tribes A1ryan and non-A1ryan originally beyond the pale.

भरत
भरत
 is the name of a people of great importance in the Rigveda and the later literature. In the Rigveda they appear prominently in the third and seventh Man2d2alas in connexion with Suda1s and the Tr2tsus, 1) iii. 53, 9. 12, 24; 33, 11, 12 (Vis4va1 mitra, who is accordingly hailed as Bharata-r2s2abha, ‘bull of the Bharatas,’ in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17, 7); vii. 8, 4; 33, 6, in which passage a defeat of the Bharatas, and their rescue by the aid of Vasis2t2ha, is clearly referred to; not, as was formerly thought (e.g., Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 354; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 127), a defeat of the Bharatas by the Tr2tsus. while in the sixth Man2d2ala they are associated with Divoda1sa. 2) vi. 16, 4. 5. Cf. verse 19. In one passage 3) vii. 8, 4. the Bharatas are, like the Tr2tsus, enemies of the Pu1rus: there can be little doubt that Ludwig's view of the identity of the Bharatas and and Tr2tsus is practically correct. More precisely Oldenberg 5) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 207. In Buddha, 405 et seq., he accepted the identification of Ludwig. considers that the Tr2tsus are the Vasis2t2has, the family singers of the Bharatas; while Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 2, 136 et seq. recognizes, with perhaps more probability, in the Tr2tsus the royal family of the Bharatas. That the Tr2tsus and Bharatas were enemies, as Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 127. This is also Bloomfield's view (see Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 41, 42). holds, is most improbable even on geographical grounds, for the Tr2tsus in Zimmer's view 8) Op. cit., 124. occupied the country to the east of the Parus2n2i1 (Ravi), and the Bharatas must therefore be regarded as coming against the Tr2tsus from the west, whereas the Rigveda 9) iii. 23, 4: in verse 2 Devasravas and Devava1ta are mentioned as Bha1ratas, Oldenberg, Buddha, 410, n., mentions that in the Maha1bha1rata, iii. 6065, a tributary of the Sarasvati1 is called Kaus4iki1, and the Kus4ikas are, of course, the family of Vis4va1mitra, whose connexion with the Bharatas is beyond question. recognizes two Bharata chiefs on the Sarasvati1, A1paya1, and Dr2s2advati1--that is, in the holy land of India, the Madhyades4a. Hillebrandt 10) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 111. His view is that Suda1s and the Bharatas were later comers than the Tr2tsus, who joined them as one people, the Vasis2t2has becoming the priests of the Bharatas. He suggests that the Vasis2t2has were not originally adherents of the IndraSoma cult, but were specially devoted to the Varun2a cult; but there is no decisive evidence for either suggestion. Cf. Bloomfield, as cited in n. 7. sees in the connexion of the Tr2tsus and the Bharatas a fusion of two tribes; but this is not supported by any evidence beyond the fact that in his opinion some such theory is needed to explain Divoda1sa's appearing in connexion with the Bharadva1ja family, while Suda1s, his son, ^4 Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 172 et seq. or perhaps grandson (cf. Pijavana), is connected with the Vasis2t2has and the Vis4va1mitras. In the later literature the Bharatas appear as especially famous. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 11) xiii. 5, 4. mentions Bharata Dauh2s2anti as a king, sacrificer of the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) and S4ata1ni1ka Sa1tra1jita, as another Bharata who offered that sacrifice. The Aitareya Bra1hman2a 12) viii. 23 and 21. mentions Bharata Dauh2s2anti as receiving the kingly coronation from Di1rghatamas Ma1mateya, and S4ata1ni1ka as being consecrated by Somas4us2man Va1jaratna1yana, a priest whose name is of quite late origin. The geographical position of the Bharata people is clearly shown by the fact that the Bharata kings win victories over the Ka1s4is, and make offerings on the Yamuna1 (Jumna) and Gan3ga1 (Ganges). 13) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 11. 21. Moreover, in the formula of the king's proclamation for the people, the variants recorded 14) In the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 10, 2, and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 4, 2, the phrase is es2a vo, Bharata1, ra1ja1; the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, in the Ka1n2va recension, xi. 3, 3; 6, 3, has Kuravah2, Pan5ca1la1h2 (evidently as a joint people); A1pastamba, xviii. 12, 7, gives Bharata1h2, Kuravah2, Pan5ca1la1h2, Kuru-Pan5ca1la1h2, and janata1h2, as alternatives, according to the people to whom the king belongs; the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 7, and the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 7, read esa te janate ra1ja1. See Weber, Indian Literature, 114, n.; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 465. include Kuravah2, Pan5ca1la1h2, Kuru-Pan5ca1la1h2, and Bharata1h2; and the Maha1bha1rata consistently recognizes the royal family of the Kurus as a Bharata family. 15) Oldenberg, Buddha, 409. It is therefore extremely probable that Oldenberg 16) Op. cit., 408. He points out (409, n.) that in the Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, only the Kuru king. Janamejaya, and the Bharata kings are mentioned without specification of the peoples over whom they ruled. is right in holding that the Bharatas in the times of the Bra1hman2as were merging in the Kuru-Pan5ca1la people. The ritual practices of the Bharatas are repeatedly mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 17) xiv. 3, 13; xv. 5, 24, and perhaps xviii. 10, 8, on which see Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 28, n. 2; below, p. 98. the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 18) ii. 25; iii. 18. The sense ‘mercenary soldier,’ here seen by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2 (no longer mentioned in the Dictionary of Bo7htlingk), cannot be accepted. See Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 254; Oldenberg, Buddha, 407, n. On the other hand, there is no mention of the Bharatas in the geographical lists of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 14). in the Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra, or in the Buddhist texts. This means that the Bharatas were no longer a people, but a family or sub-tribe in a larger people. the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 19) v. 4, 4, 1. and the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 20) i. 27, 2. Already in the Rigveda 21) ii. 7, 1. 5; iv. 25, 4; vi. 16, 19; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 9, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 2, 2. Roth thinks this epithet of Agni perhaps means ‘warlike,’ but this is unlikely. there is mention made of Agni Bha1rata (‘of the Bharatas’). In the A1pri1 hymns 22) Rv. i. 22, 10; 142, 9; 188, 8; ii. 1, 11; 3, 8; iii. 4, 8, etc. occurs a goddess Bha1rati1, the personified divine protective power of the Bharatas: her association in the hymns with Sarasvati1 reflects the connexion of the Bharatas with the Sarasvati1 in the Rigveda. 9) iii. 23, 4: in verse 2 Devasravas and Devava1ta are mentioned as Bha1ratas, Oldenberg, Buddha, 410, n., mentions that in the Maha1bha1rata, iii. 6065, a tributary of the Sarasvati1 is called Kaus4iki1, and the Kus4ikas are, of course, the family of Vis4va1mitra, whose connexion with the Bharatas is beyond question. Again, in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 23) i. 4, 2, 2. Agni is referred to as bra1hman2a Bha1rata, ‘priest of the Bharatas,’ and is invited to dispose of the offering Manus2vat Bharatavat, ‘like Manu,’ ‘like Bharata.’ 24) i. 5, 1, 7. In one or two passages 25) i. 112, 14; vii. 19, 8. Suda1s or Divoda1sa and, on the other hand, Purukutsa or Trasadasyu appear in a friendly relation. Possibly this points, as Oldenberg 26) Op. cit., 410. suggests, to the union of Bharatas and Pu1rus with the Kurus. A Bharata is referred to in the fifth Man2d2ala of the Rigveda: 27) v. 54, 14. For a later legend of Bharata, cf. Leumann, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 80 et seq.; von Bradke, ibid., 498-503; and see Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 13, 338, 340, etc. who he was is uncertain.

See also Rv. i. 112, 13; 116, 18; x. 150, 5; 181, 2. and the Bharadva1jas 3) Rv. vi. 10, 6; 16, 33; 17, 14; 23, 10; 25, 9; 35, 4; 47, 25; 59, 15. See also Rv. i. 59, 7. are repeatedly mentioned as singers in that Man2d2ala. Judging by the tone of the references to Bharadva1ja, he can hardly be deemed to have been a contemporary of any of the hymns. 4) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 210 212. According to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 5) xv. 3, 7. he was the Purohita of Divoda1sa. This interpretation is to be preferred to that of Roth, 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. See Rv. i. 116, 18; vi. 16, 5; 31, 4. who suggests that he and Divoda1sa were identical. His connexion with the house of Divoda1sa also appears from the statement of the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 7) xxi. 10 (Indische Studien, 3, 478). that Bharadva1ja gave Pratardana the kingdom. It is unnecessary to suppose that the same Bharadva1ja was meant in both cases, and that Pratardana was a son of Divoda1sa: the later Sam2hita1s refer to Bharadva1ja, like the other great sages, irrespective of chronology. The Bharadva1jas in their poems mention Br2bu, Br2saya, and the Pa1ra1vatas. 8) vi. 61, 1-3. Hillebrandt 9) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 104. has pointed out that they are also connected with the Sr2n5jayas. In particular, the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 10) xvi. 11, 11. mentions that Bharadva1ja gained largesse from Prastoka Sa1rn5jaya and Br2bu. But it is very doubtful if it is correct to place all these people and Divoda1sa in Arachosia and Drangiana. Bharadva1ja as an author and a seer is frequently referred to in the later Sam2hita1s 11) Av. ii. 12, 2; iv. 29, 5; xviii. 3, 16; xix. 48, 6; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 19; xx. 9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 19; iv. 8, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 55, etc. and the Bra1hman2as. 12) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 18; viii. 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 11, 13; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 2, 2; 4, 2; ii. 2, 2. 4, etc.; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xv. 1; xxix. 3; xxx. 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 128; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 31.

भरन्त्
भरन्त्,
 ‘bearing,’ in the plural denotes in one passage of the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xviii. 10, 8. according to Bo7htlingk, 2) Dictionary, s.v. following Sa1yan2a, ‘the warrior caste,’ but the sense is not certain. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 10, 28, n. 2. Cf. Bharata, n. 17. was inclined to see a reference to the Bharatas, though the form of the word is that of the present participle. 4) Bharata1m, interpreted by Sa1yan2a as bharan2am2 kurvata1m ks2atriya1n2a1m.

भरूजी
भरूजी
 in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 24. 8. may denote, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. a noxious animal. 

भर्तृ
भर्तृ,
 besides having the literal sense of ‘bearer,’ means ‘supporter’ or ‘master’ in the older literature; 1) Av. xi. 7, 15; xviii. 2, 30; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 4, 7 (where ‘husband’ is possible); iv. 6, 7, 21, etc. but it is doubtful whether the sense of ‘husband’ is ever found there. In one passage of the Rigveda 2) v. 58, 7. ‘husband’ is certainly the most natural sense, but, as Delbru7ck 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 415, n. 1. correctly remarks, even there ‘father’ may be meant, since ‘mother’ is here and there 4) Av. v. 5, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 1, 4. called Bhartri1.

भलानस्
भलानस्,
 plural, is the name in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 7. of one of the five tribes, Pakthas, Bhala1nases, Alinas, Vis2a1n2ins, and S4ivas, who are mentioned as ranged on the side 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260, 261, who takes the form of the name to be Bhala1na (but the text of the Rv. has bhala1na¤sah2), and who overlooks Zimmer's later view. of the enemies of Suda1s in the battle of the ten kings (Da1s4ara1jn5a), not opposed to them, as Roth, 3) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95. and at one time Zimmer, 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. thought. Zimmer 5) Op. cit., 431. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173, 207. suggests as their original home East Kabulistan, comparing the name of the Bolan pass. This seems a reasonably probable view.

What his functions exactly were is uncertain. Sa1yan2a in some places 3) On Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 and Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit., and on S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 9. renders the word by ‘tax-collector’ but in others 4) On S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 2, 17. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 63, n. as ‘carver,’ thus making this functionary either a revenue officer or a mere court official.

Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 29, 20. suggests that merely a member of the household (‘who is to be maintained’) may be meant.

भाव्य
भाव्य
 is the name of a patron, as it seems, in the Rigveda. 1) i. 126, 1; Nirukta, ix. 10. In the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xvi. 11, 5. Cf. Br2haddevata1, iii. 140. the form given is Bha1vayavya, being a patronymic of Svanaya, who is the patron of Kaks2i1vant. This combination is borne out by the Rigveda, where Kaks2i1vant and Svanaya are mentioned in the same verse, 3) i. 126, 3. while Svanaya must be meant in the verse of the same hymn, 4) i. 126, 1. where Bha1vya is mentioned as ‘living on the Sindhu’ (Indus). Roth's 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1 f. view that Bha1vya here is perhaps a gerundive meaning to be ‘reverenced’ is not probable. Ludwig 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 151. Cf. Weber, Episches im Vedischen Ritual, 22; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 128. thinks Svanaya was connected with the Nahus2as.

Franke, Bezzenberger's Beitra7ge, 17, 54 et seq., who distinguishes the Bha1s2a1 as the speech of conversational use from the language regulated by Pa1n2ini's rules. But see Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xliv; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 179, 180. denotes the ordinary speech of the day as opposed to Vedic language. Cf. Va1c.

भास

 is the name of a bird of prey in the Adbhuta Bra1hman2a, 1) vi. 8, See Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 40. and often in the Epic. 

भिक्षा
भिक्षा,
 ‘begging,’ is one of the duties of the Brahmaca1rin according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) xi. 3, 3, 7. Cf. a Mantra in A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 9, etc.; and bhiks2a1carya, Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 4, 1; iv. 4, 26. The word has also the sense of ‘alms,’ as that which is obtained by begging, in the Atharvaveda. 2) xi. 5, 9. According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, 3) s.v. 2. it has this sense in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 4) viii. 8, 5, where the scholiast explains the word by ‘perfumes, garlands, food,’ etc. (gandhama1lya1nna1di). also, but the correct reading there is probably A1miks2a1.

भिक्षु
भिक्षु,
 ‘beggar,’ is a term not found in Vedic literature. The begging of the Brahmaca1rin is quite a different thing from the duties of the Bhiks2u in the later system of the A1s4ramas (religious stages of life), when the Brahmin in the last stage of his life, after leaving his home and family, lives on alms alone. See 1. Bra1hman2a.

भित्ति

 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 5, 3, 9. Cf. Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, viii. 3, 24. denotes a mat made of split reeds.

भिषज्
भिषज्,
 ‘physician,’ is a word of common occurrence in the Rigveda 1) ii. 33, 4; vi. 50, 7; ix. 112, 1; bhes2aja, adjective, ii. 33, 7; x. 137, 6; substantive, i. 23, 19. 20; ii. 33, 2. 4; vi. 74, 3; vii. 46, 3, etc. and later. 2) Av. v. 29, 1; vi. 24, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 9, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 5; xix. 12. 88; xxx. 10, etc.; bhes2aja, adjective, Av. vi. 109, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 45, etc.; substantive, Av. v. 29, 1; vi. 21, 2; xi. 1, 9, etc. There is no trace whatever in the former text of the profession being held in disrepute: the As4vins, 3) Rv. i. 116, 16; 157, 6; viii. 18, 8; 86, 1; x. 39, 3. 5; Av. vii. 53, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 18. Varun2a, 4) See Rv. i. 24, 9. and Rudra 5) Rv. ii. 33, 4. 7. are all called physicians. On the other hand, in the Dharma literature 6) See A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, i. 6, 18, 20; 19, 15; Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xvii. 17; Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, xiv. 2, 19; Vis2n2u, li. 10; lxxxii. 9; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 1. this profession is utterly despised. This dislike is found as early as the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 7) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 9, 3. Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 2; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 14; Bloomfield, op. cit., xxxix, xl. where the As4vins are condemned because of their having to do with the practice of medicine (bhes2aja), on the ground that it brings them too much among men, an allusion to the caste dislike of promiscuous contact. The Rigveda 8) x. 97. contains a hymn in which a physician celebrates his plants and their healing powers. Moreover, wonderful cures are referred to as performed by the As4vins: the healing of the lame 9) Rv. i. 112, 8; x. 39, 3, etc. and of the blind; 10) Cf. the case of R2jra1s4va, Rv. i. 116, 17. the rejuvenation of the aged Cyavana 11) Rv. x. 39, 4. and of Puram2dhi's husband; 12) i. 116, 13. the giving of an iron leg (jan3gha1 a1yasi1) to Vis4pala1, 13) Rv. i. 116, 15, etc. a deed only more wonderful if we assume that Vis4pala1 was a mare, as has been suggested by Pischel. 14) Vedische Studien, 1, 171 et seq.; 305. It would in all probability be a mistake to assume 15) As Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 398, is inclined to do. that the Vedic Indians had any surgical skill: they no doubt applied simples to wounds, 16) Cf. Rv. ix. 112, 1. but both their medicien and their surgery must have been most primitive. All that the Atharvaveda shows in regard to medicine is the use of herbs combined with spells, 17) So it is said in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xii. 9, 10: bhes2ajam2 va1 A1tharvan2a1ni, ‘the Atharvan hymns are medicine’; xvi. 10, 10; and cf. ibid., xxiii. 16, 7; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 5 and 2. Bhis2aj. and of water (cf. Jala1s2a), remedies Indo-European in character, but not of much scientific value. On the other hand, the knowledge of anatomy shown (see S4ari1ra), though betraying grave inaccuracies, is not altogether insignificant; but that was due no doubt mainly to the practice of dissecting animals at the sacrifice. There is some evidence in the Rigveda 18) ix. 112, where a profession must be meant. Ibid., 3, refers to the fees of the physician. Cf. also x. 97, 4. 8. that the practice of medicine was already a profession; this is supported by the inclusion of a physician in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 19) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 10; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 4, 1. According to Bloomfield, 20) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 456. a hymn of the Atharvaveda 21) v. 30, 5. But this sense is doubtful. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 277. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 397-399; Bloomfield, op. cit., passim (see references on p. 697); Atharvaveda, 59 et seq.; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 420 et seq.; Jolly, Medicin, 16, 17; Winternitz, Nature, 1898, 233-235; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, passim. contains a physician's deprecation of the use of home-made remedies instead of reliance on his professional training.

2. Bhis2aj A1tharvan2a is the name of a mythic physician mentioned in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 1) xvi. 3 (Indische Studien, 3, 459). Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxi; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 181.

भीमवैदर्भ
भीम वैदर्भ
 (‘prince of Vidarbha’) is mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (vii. 34) as having received instruction regarding the substitute for the Soma juice, through a succession of teachers, from Parvata and Na1rada.

भीमसेन
भीम-सेन
 is the name of one of the brothers of Janamejaya, the Pa1riks2iti1yas, in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) xiii. 5, 4, 3. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xvi. 9, 3.

भुज्यु
1. Bhujyu denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, an ‘adder’ in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) iv. 27, 4; x. 95, 8. and one of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 2) xviii. 42. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 126, who takes bhujyu in Rv. x. 95, 8, as meaning ‘ardent,’ ‘rutting.’ But the sense is uncertain in all these passages.

भुज्यु
2. Bhujyu is the name of a man, son of Tugra, who is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 6, 20; 116, 3; 117, 14; 119, 4; vi. 62, 6; vii. 68, 7; 69, 7; x. 40, 7; 65, 12; 143, 5. as saved from the deep by the As4vins. According to Bu7hler, 2) Indische Palœographie, 17. Cf. Baunack, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 35, 485; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 214; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 16, n. 5; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 244, 245; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 52. the passages refer to Bhujyu being saved from shipwreck during a voyage in the Indian Ocean, but the evidence is inadequate to support this conclusion. Cf. Samudra.

भुज्युलाह्यायनि
भुज्यु लाह्यायनि
 (‘descendant of Lahya1yana’) is the name of a teacher, a contemporary of Ya1jn5avalkya, in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (iii. 3, 1).

भुरिज्
भुरिज्
 (used in the dual only) is a word of somewhat doubtful sense. Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 466. regarded it as meaning in some passages 2) Rv. viii. 4, 16; Av. xx. 127, 4. ‘scissors,’ and in others 3) Rv. iv. 2, 14; ix. 26, 4; 71, 5. where Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 239243, considers that the shafts of the chariot are meant (cf. Gobhila Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 4, 31, whence it appears that the chariot-pole, spoken of as having two arms, was forked). The same view regarding the passages cited in n. 2 gives the sense of a stropping apparatus, consisting of two pieces of wood, between which a grindstone moves. Cf.

भूत-विद्या
 is one of the sciences enumerated in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 1) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. Cf. Little, Grammatical Index, 115. It seems to mean the ‘science of creatures’ that trouble men, and of the means of warding them off, ‘demonology.’

भूतवीर
भूत-वीर
 is the name of a family of priests who, according to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) vii. 27. Cf. Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 118; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 344, n. 3; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 437 et seq. were employed by Janamejaya to the exclusion of the Kas4yapas. A family of the latter, the Asitamr2gas, however, won back the favour of Janamejaya, and ousted the Bhu1tavi1ras. 

भूतांश
भूतांश
 is in the Rigveda 1) x. 106, 11. See Nirukta, xii, 41; Br2haddevata1. viii. 18. 19; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133. the name of a poet, a descendant of Kas4yapa.

भूति
भूति
 is the term used in the Rigveda 1) viii. 59, 7. Cf. i. 161, 1 (both late passages). and later 2) Av. ix. 6, 45; x. 3, 17; 6, 9; xi. 7, 22; 8, 21; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 1, 1; 3, 5, etc.; bhu1ti-ka1ma, ‘desiring prosperity,’ Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 1, 1; 2, 3, 3; v. 1, 9, 1, etc. for ‘prosperity.’

भूमि
भूमि
 or Bhu1mi1 is a common word for ‘earth’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 64, 5; 161, 14; ii. 14, 7, etc. So in x. 18, 10, ‘mother earth’ receives the remains of the dead. and later, 2) Av. vi. 2, 1, where it is said that the Bhu1mi is the highest of the three earths (Pr2thivi1); xi. 7, 14, where nine earths and seas are mentioned; ii. 9, 4; vi. 8, 2, etc. being practically a synonym of Pr2thivi1. It is also used of the land given by the god to the A1ryan, 3) Rv. iv. 26, 2. Cf. vi. 47, 20. and of grants of land. 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 24; 6, 2, 18.

भूमिदुन्दुभि
भूमि-दुन्दुभि,
 ‘earth drum,’ denotes a pit covered with a hide used at the Maha1vrata rite, and mentioned in the Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 9, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 5. and the Bra1hman2as. 2) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 19; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 1, 5. Cf. Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 277, n. 14.

भूमिपाश
भूमि-पाश,
 ‘earth net,’ is the name of a plant in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, probably some sort of creeper. ^1 xiii. 8, 1, 16. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 427, n. 1.

भृगवाण
भृगवाण
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 120, 5. apparently 2) Pischel, Vedische Studien, i. 4; 2, 92. as a name of a man who is called S4obha. Ludwig, 3) U7ber Methode bei Interpretation, 4. however, thinks that his name was Ghos2a. Elsewhere the word appears as an epithet of Agni, doubtless in allusion to his cult by the Bhr2gus. 

भृगु
भृगु
 is a sage of almost entirely mythical character in the Rigveda and later. He counts as a son of Varun2a, 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 1, 1; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ix. 1. Cf. Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xviii. 9, 2; Nirukta, iii. 17. bearing the patronymic Va1run2i. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 34, and n. 14. For a different form of the legend, cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 2, 5. In the plural the Bhr2gus are repeatedly 3) Rv. i. 58, 6; 127, 7; 143, 4; ii. 4, 2; iii. 2, 4; iv. 7, 1, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 51. The legend of their chariot-making (Rv. iv. 16, 20; x. 39, 14) may be due, as Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., suggests, to a confusion with the R2bhus. It may, however, be an allusion to the historic Bhr2gus, whom we find in the battle of the ten kings. alluded to as devoted to the fire cult. They are clearly 4) As shown by the legend of fire having been brought to them by Ma1taris4van, Rv. iii. 5, 10. no more than a group of ancient priests and ancestors with an eponymous Bhr2gu 5) i. 60, 1, where, however, Roth, loc. cit., takes the singular in a collective sense, an interpretation which may be correct, but is not necessary. in the Rigveda, except in three passages, 6) Rv. vii. 18, 6; viii. 3, 9; 6, 18, to which list, given by Macdonell, loc. cit., Roth adds viii. 102, 4, Aurva-Bhr2gu-vat, ‘like Aurva and Bhr2gu.’ Cf. the fact that the Aurvas, in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 33, take the place of the Bhr2gus of the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 5. where they are evidently regarded as an historic family. It is not clear, however, whether they were priests or warriors: in the battle of the ten kings the Bhr2gus appear with the Druhyus, perhaps as their priests, but this is not certain. 7) In viii. 3, 9; 6, 18; 102, 4, the reference to a priestly family is the more natural; in vii. 18, 6, warriors may be meant. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 262, n., where he cites ix. 101, 13, as perhaps denoting the same thing. In the later literature the Bhr2gus are a real family, with subdivisions like the Aitas4a1yana, according to the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a. 8) xxx. 5. See n. 6. The Bhr2gus are mentioned as priests in connexion with various rites, such as the Agnistha1pana 9) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 5, 2; v. 6, 8, 6; Av. iv. 14, 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 1 (p. 48). and the Das4apeyakratu. 10) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 18; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 2, 5; Pan5cavims4a Bra1hman2a, xviii. 9, 2. In many passages they are conjoined with the An3girases. 11) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 1, 7, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 1, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 18; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 8; iii. 2, 7, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 1, 13, etc. Cf. Rv. viii. 35, 3; 43, 13; x. 14, 6, in the first and last of which passages the Atharvans also occur. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxvii. n. 2. Hence, in the Atharvanic ritual texts, the term Bhr2gvan3girasah2 is applied to the Atharvaveda (Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 9, 10, 107 et seq.). the close association of the two families is shown by the fact that Cyavana is called either a Bha1rgava or an A1n3girasa in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 12) iv. 1, 5, 1. In the Atharvaveda 13) v. 19, 1. the name of Bhr2gu is selected to exemplify the dangers incurred by the oppressors of Brahmans: the Sr2n5jaya Vaitahavyas perish in consequence of an attack on Bhr2gu. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 14) ii. 20. In the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 42-44 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 204), Bhr2gu Va1run2i appears as a student. Cf. Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, iii. 1. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 169-173; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 140; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 443 et seq. also Bhr2gu has this representative character. Cf. Bhr2gava1n2a and Bha1rgava.

भृङ्गा
भृङ्गा
 is the name of a species of bee, later specified as large and black, in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 2, 22. and the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 29. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96. which include it in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’).

भेद
1. Bheda, one of the enemies of Suda1s and the Tr2tsuBharatas, was defeated by the former in the Yamuna1 (Jumna), 1) Rv. vii. 18, 18. 19; 33, 3; 83, 4. apparently in a second conflict fought after the battle of the ten kings, in which Suda1s successfully defended his western frontier against the confederate foes. The Ajas, S4igrus, and Yaks2us, who are mentioned as also defeated, may have been united under his leadership if he was a king; or the Bhedas may have been a separate people, as Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 12 (the word is always used in the singular). thinks. Hopkins' 3) India, Old and New, 52. opinion that the defeat was on the Parus2n2i1, Yamuna1 being another name of that stream, is most improbable; nor is the view that Bheda was one of the ten kings essential. 4) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260 et seq. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 20, n.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 319, 327. Cf. Turvas4a.

भेद
2. Bheda is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 4, 49. 50. as having come to a bad end because he refused a cow (vas4a1) to Indra when asked for it. That he is different from the preceding Bheda, as Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 13. assumes, is not certain. Indeed, it may very well be that his defeat led to his being chosen as the representative of the evil end of the wicked man. Moreover, the irreligious character of Bheda may be ascribed to his being a leader of non-A1ryan folk, if the Ajas and S4igrus, with whom in the Rigveda he is connected or associated were, as is possible, though by no means certain, un-A1ryan tribes of totemists. 3) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 153, who inclines to see in them totemistic tribes, but the names furnish the sole support of this conjecture. On this supposition they were probably non-A1ryan. Cf. Aja.

भेषज
1. Bhes2aja, denoting a ‘remedial agent,’ ‘medicine,’ is often mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 89, 4; ii. 33, 2, etc. and later, 2) Av. v. 29, 1; vi. 21, 2, etc. being also used in a figurative sense. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 1, 1; 5, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 41. Plants, 4) Rv. x. 97, and passim in the Atharvaveda. waters, 5) i. 23, 19. 20; 34, 6, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 9, 2; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xvi. 7, etc. Possibly there is some truth in Zimmer's view, Altindisches Leben, 399, that the reference is to the beneficial effects of bathing. and spells 6) Exemplified in the medical spells of the Atharvaveda and the Kaus4ika Su1tra. are repeatedly enumerated as medicines. Most of the medical practices of the Atharvaveda are merely examples of sympathetic magic. For example, in one hymn 7) i. 22; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 264, et seq. the yellow of jaundice is entreated to pass into yellow birds. In another 8) vii. 116; Bloomfield, op. cit., 565 et seq. fever is to be banished by means of a frog; for the frog, being a potent means of cooling fire 9) Cf. Rv. x. 16, 14; Av. xviii. 3, 60. (because of its association with water), is regarded as analogously effective in banishing the fire of fever. See Bhis2aj. 

भेषज
2. Bhes2aja in the plural is found in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 6, 14. and in the Su1tras 2) A1s4vala1yana Srauta Su1tra, x. 7, 3; Sa1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 2, 10; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xii. 9, 10. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxxi. 628. denoting the hymns of the Atharvaveda in so far as they are regarded as having ‘healing’ powers.

भैमसेन
भैम-सेन,
 ‘descendant of Bhi1masena,’ is the name of a man in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (iv. 6, 6).

भैमसेनि
भैम-सेनि,
 ‘descendant of Bhi1masena,’ is the patronymic of Divoda1sa in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 1) vii. 8 (Indische Studien, 3, 460, 472).

भैषज्य
भैषज्य
 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xii, 7. 1, 12) and the Nirukta (x. 7. 25) denotes ‘healing remedy’ or ‘medicine,’ like Bhes2aja.

भोग
भोग
 in the Rigveda 1) v. 29, 6; vi. 75, 14 (where the Hastaghna, or ‘hand-guard,’ of the archer is compared to a snake). and later 2) Av. xi. 9, 5; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 4, 5. 6; v. 4, 5, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 4; xxi. 8, etc. denotes the ‘coil’ of a serpent.

भोज
भोज
 in several passages of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 12. 14. 17) seems to be used as a king's title.

भौज्य
भौज्य
 in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 32; viii. 6. 12. 14. 16. denotes the rank of a prince bearing the title of Bhoja.

भौमक
भौमक
 is the name of some animal in the late Adbhuta Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 1, 40.

भौमी
भौमी
 is the name of an animal in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 1) v. 5, 18, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. 

भौवन
भौवन,
 ‘descendant of Bhuvana,’ is the patronymic of the mythical Vis4vakarman in the S4atapatha (xiii. 7, 1, 15) and the Aitareya (viii. 21, 8. 10) Bra1hman2as, and the Nirukta (x. 26).

भौवायन
भौवायन,
 ‘descendant of Bhuva,’ is the patronymic of Kapivana in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xx. 13, 4. It is also found in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxii. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 473); Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 5; and Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 54, where Kapivana is not mentioned. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15 55, 69.

भ्रातृ
भ्रातृ
 is the common designation of ‘brother’ from the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 1; iv. 3, 13; v. 34, 4, etc.; Av. i. 14, 2; ii. 13, 5; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 8, 4, etc.; bhra1tr2tva, Rv. viii. 20, 22; 83, 8; x. 108, 10. onwards. The word is also applied to a relation or close friend generally, 2) Bo7htlingk and Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 462. but here the persons concerned are, it should be noted, in the Rigveda 3) i. 161, 1; 170, 2; iii. 53, 5; iv. 1, 2; vi. 51, 5; viii. 43, 16. Cf. Av. iv. 4, 5; v. 22, 12. deities, who are brothers of one another or of the worshipper. Thus in the early literature the word has not really lost its precise sense. The derivation from the root bhr2, ‘support,’ is probably correct, designating the brother as the support of his sister. This harmonizes with the fact that in Vedic literature the brother plays the part of protector of his sister when bereft of her father, and that maidens deprived of their brothers (abhra1tr2) meet an evil fate. 4) Rv. i. 124, 7; iv. 5, 5; Av. i. 17, 1; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 328. Cf. Ayogu1. The gradation of the relations in the home is shown by the order in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 5) vii. 15, 2. where father, mother, brother, and sister are successively mentioned. Strife between brothers is occasionally referred to. 6) Cf. Av. iii. 30, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 3, where it is a sign of serious confusion; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxlv; Bloomfield Atharvaveda, 72. 

भ्रातृव्य
भ्रातृव्य
 is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 22, 12, and perhaps x. 3, 9. where, being named with brother and sister, it must be an expression of relationship. The sense appears to be ‘(father's) brother's son,’ ‘cousin,’ 2) The word is rendered ‘cousin’ by Whitney in his Translation of the Atharvaveda (x. 6, 1; xv. 1, 8). this meaning alone accounting for the sense of ‘rival,’ ‘enemy,’ found elsewhere in the Atharvaveda, 3) ii. 18, 1; viii. 10, 18. 33; x. 9, 1. and repeatedly in the other Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 9, 2, etc.; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 7; xxvii. 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 17; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, etc.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 1, 21, etc.; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xii. 13, 2. Cf. Rv. viii. 21, 13. In an undivided family the relations of cousins would easily develop into rivalry and enmity. The original meaning may, however, have been ‘nephew,’ 5) Whitney, in his Translation of the Atharvaveda (ii. 18, 1), while rendering the word by ‘adversary,’ explains it in a note as meaning literally ‘nephew,’ or ‘brother's son.’ as the simple etymological sense would be ‘brother's son’; but this seems not to account for the later meaning so well. The Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 6) xxvii. 8. prescribes the telling of a falsehood to a Bhra1tr2vya, who, further, is often given the epithets ‘hating’ (dvis2an) and ‘evil’ (apriya, pa1pman) in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 7) See several of the passages given in n. 4. The Atharvaveda 8) ii. 18, 1; x. 9, 1, etc. Cf. Tait tiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 3. 2, 1, etc. Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 501, 506, 507, who thinks it means a kind of brother, and through early family conditions was restricted to cousins; Bo7htlingk and Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 307. also contains various spells, which aim at destroying or expelling one's ‘rivals.’

भ्रूणहन्
भ्रूण-हन्,
 ‘slaying an embryo’; Bhru1n2a-hatya1, ‘the slaying of an embryo,’ are terms expressing a crime which is repeatedly and severely censured in the later Sam2hita1s, 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 9; Ka1thaka Sa1m2hita1, xxxi. 7; Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1, xlvii (cited in Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 579, 580); Av. vi. 112, 3; 113, 2. The Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 10, 3, and Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8; 11, have brahma-han instead; but see ibid., 12. where it is said to be the greatest of all crimes, and one of which the guilt cannot be removed. In many later passages 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 15, 3; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 8, 2; x. 1, 15; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 22. The substantive is found in Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 20, 1; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 7, 3; 8, 3; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 1; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 18, 19; Nirukta, vi. 27. Bhru1n2a itself occurs in Rv. x. 155. 2. the same crime is referred to, always with reprobation: this fact alone shows the erroneousness of the theory 3) See Pati, p. 487, with n. 131. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 481; 10, 66; Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 430; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 521, 522. that daughters could be allowed, once born, to die if their fathers so desired. M.

मकक
मकक,
 a word occurring once in the Atharvaveda (viii. 6, 12), may be the name of some unknown animal; but it is possibly an adjective having some such sense as ‘bleating.’

मकर
मकर
 is the name of an animal, probably the ‘crocodile,’ 1) The Makara, as a Hindu sculptural ornament, originally represented a crocodile. Cf. Cousen's article in the Annual Report of the Archaological Survey of India for 1903-4, pp. 227-231 (where the Makara appears as the vehicle of Varun2a and of Gan3ga1). Cf. also op. cit., 1904-5, pp. 80, 83, 84. which is included in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 13, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 16; Va1ja saneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 35. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97.

मक्ष
मक्ष,
 ‘fly,’ is found in the Rigveda 1) iv. 45, 4; vii. 32, 2. and the Atharvaveda, 2) ix. 1, 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97. where its fondness for sweet things is alluded to. Cf. Admasad

मक्षा
मक्षा, मक्षिका,
 denote both ‘fly’ 1) Maks2ika1, Rv. i. 162, 9; Av. xi. 1, 2; 9, 10; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 3, 2. and ‘bee’ 2) Maks2a1, Rv. x. 40, 6; Maks2ika1, i. 119, 9; Pras4na Upanis2ad, ii. 4, where a ‘king bee’ (madhukara-ra1jan) is referred to. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97; Hillebrandt. Vedische Mythologie, 1, 240, n. 1. in the Rigveda and later. 

मख
मख
 appears to designate a person in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) ix. 101, 13, where the Bhr2gus are mentioned as opposed to Makha (cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 51); x. 171, 2. but in neither passage does the context explain who he was. Probably a demon of some kind is meant. In the later Sam2hita1s 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 57; xxxvii. 7; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 1, 8, 1; iii. 2, 4, 1. mention is also made of the ‘head of Makha,’ an expression which has become unintelligible to the Bra1hman2as. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 2, 17. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

मगध
मगध
 is the name of a people who appear throughout Vedic literature as of little repute. Though the name is not actually found in the Rigveda, 1) See Kikat2a. it occurs in the Atharvaveda, 2) v. 22, 14, where the Paippala1da recension has mayebhih2, which is a mere blunder, but substitutes the Ka1s4is for the An3gas. where fever is wished away to the Gandha1r2is and Mu1javants, northern peoples, and to the An3gas and Magadhas, peoples of the east. Again, in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5, 22; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 1. the Ma1gadha, or man of Magadha, is included as dedicated to ati-krus2t2a, ‘loud noise’(?), while in the Vra1tya hymn of the Atharvaveda 4) xv. 2, 1-4. the Ma1gadha is said to be connected with the Vra1tya as his Mitra, his Mantra, his laughter, and his thunder in the four quarters. In the S4rauta Su1tras 5) La1t2ya1yar S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 6, 28; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 4, 22. Cf. Sa1yan2a on Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 1, 16. 17. the equipment characteristic of the Vra1tya is said to be given, when the latter is admitted into the A1ryan Brahminical community, to a bad Brahmin living in Magadha (brahma-bandhu Ma1gadha-des4i1ya), but this point does not occur in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 6) xvii. 1, 16. On the other hand, respectable Brahmins sometimes lived there, for the Kaus2i1taki A1ran2yaka 7) vii. 13; this is not mentioned in the earlier Aitareya A1ran2yaka. mentions Madhyama, Pra1ti1bodhi1-putra, as Magadha-va1sin, ‘living in Magadha.’ Oldenberg, 8) Buddha, 400, n.; Weber, Indian Literature, 112, n. however, seems clearly right in regarding this as unusual. The Magadhas are evidently a people in the Baudha1yana and other Su1tras, 9) Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, i. 2, 13; Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xx. 13; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 6, 18; Hiran2yakes4i S4rauta Su1tra, xvii. 6. See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Mergenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 56, 553. possibly also in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka. 10) ii. 1, 1. See Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 200; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 46, n. 4. It is therefore most improbable that Zimmer 11) Altindisches Leben, 35. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 20. can be right in thinking that in the Yajurveda 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5, 22; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 1. and the Atharvaveda 4) xv. 2, 1-4. the Ma1gadha is not a man of Magadha, but a member of the mixed caste produced by a Vais4ya marrying a Ks2atriya woman. 12) Manu, x. 11; Gautama Dharma Su1tra. iv. 17. So Sa1yan2a, on the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit., explains Ma1gadha, and Mahi1dhara, on the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, offers this as one version. But the theory of mixed castes, in any case open to some doubt, cannot be accepted when used to explain such obviously tribal names as Ma1gadha. The fact that the Ma1gadha is often in later times a minstrel is easily accounted for by the assumption that the country was the home of minstrelsy and that wandering bards from Magadha were apt to visit the more western lands. This class the later texts recognize as a caste, inventing an origin by intermarriage of the old-established castes. The dislike of the Magadhas, which may be Rigvedic, since the Ki1kat2as were perhaps the prototype of the Magadhas, was in all probability due, as Oldenberg 13) Buddha, 400, n. thinks, to the fact that the Magadhas were not really Brahminized. This is entirely in accord with the evidence of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 14) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170 et seq.; Oldenberg, op. cit., 398. Kosala here appears as more Brahminical than Videha; it is interesting to note that, while Vaideha, like Ma1gadha, is used in the later theory as a name of a mixed caste, Kausalya is not so degraded (Oldenberg, 399, n.). that neither Kosala nor Videha were fully Brahminized at an early date, much less Magadha. Weber 15) See Indische Studien, 1, 52, 53; 185; 10, 99; Indian Literature, 79, n. 1; 111, 112. suggests two other grounds that may have influenced the position--the persistence of aboriginal blood and the growth of Buddhism. The latter consideration is hardly applicable to the Yajurveda or the Atharvaveda; but the imperfect Brahminization of the land, if substituted for it in accordance with Oldenberg's suggestion, would have some force. The former motive, despite Oldenberg's doubt, seems fully justified. Pargiter 16) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, pp. 851-853. Cf. Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 6, 24, 260, 267. has gone so far as to suggest that in Magadha the A1ryans met and mingled with a body of invaders from the east by sea. Though there is no evidence for this view in the Vedic texts, it is reasonable to suppose that the farther east the A1ryans penetrated, the less did they impress themselves upon the aborigines. Modern ethnology confirms this a priori supposition in so far as it shows A1ryan types growing less and less marked as the eastern part of India is reached, although such evidence is not decisive in view of the great intermixture of peoples in India.

मगुन्दी
मगुन्दी
 is the name of some pest occurring in a verse of an Atharvaveda hymn 1) ii. 14, 2. employed to exorcise evil influences. By that verse the ‘daughters of the Magundi1’ are to be expelled from the cowstall, the wagon, and the house. It is uncertain whether an animal, insect, or demoness is meant. 2) Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 58.

Very rarely later, e.g., Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 67. denotes ‘bounty,’ and Maghavan 2) Rv. i. 31, 12; ii. 6, 4; 27, 17; v. 39, 4; 42, 8; vi. 27, 8, etc. So Magha-tti, ‘giving of gifts,’ Rv. iv. 37, 8; v. 79, 5; viii. 24, 10, etc.; Maghadeya, ‘giving of gifts,’ vii. 67, 9; x. 156, 2; Maghavat-tva, ‘liberality,’ vi. 27, 3. The word Maghavan is the epithet par excellence of Indra in the Rv. (iii. 30, 3; iv. 16, 1; 31, 7; 42, 5, etc.), and survives in post-Vedic literature as a name of Indra; otherwise, even in the later Sam2hita1s, it is very rare, occurring practically as a divine epithet only (of Indra, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 8, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 3, 13; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, ii. 11). is the regular Vedic name for the ‘generous giver’ of bounties to priests. It is doubtful whether the Maghavans were more than this, or had any special rank as a class in Vedic society. See Sabha1.

S4an3kara interprets the word by ‘thunderbolts’ (as4anayah2), while A1nandati1rtha in his commentary gives, as an alternative rendering, pa1s2a1n2a-vr2s2t2ayah2--i.e., ‘hailstones,’ which may be the sense. The S4abdakalpadruma, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. agreeing with A1nandati1rtha, 4) On Brahmasu1tra, iii. 4, 28. says that Mat2aci1 means, ‘a kind of small red bird’ (rakta-varn2a-ks2udra-paks2i-vis4es2a, reading -paks2i1-), and Jacob 5) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1911, p. 510. suggests that the ‘locust’ is meant.

That either ‘pearl’ 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or ‘diamond’ 4) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben 53. is denoted is not clear. 5) The expression hiran2ya man2i in Rv i. 33, 8, might possibly mean ‘gold a an ornament,’ but ‘gold (and) jewels is more probable. Cf. Av. xii. 1, 44, where man2im2 hiran2yam must mean a jewel (and) gold.’ It is evident that the Man2i could be strung on a thread (su1tra), which is referred to in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 6) xx. 16, 6. and elsewhere; 7) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 18, 8. Cf. iii. 4, 13; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 248; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 3, 4, 2. the Man2i was certainly also worn round the neck, for in the Rigveda 8) i. 122, 14. occurs the epithet man2i-gri1va, ‘having a jewel on the neck.’ An amulet of Bilva is celebrated in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 9) xii. 18 et seq. and many varieties of amulet are there enumerated. 10) xii. 8.

The famous frog hymn of the Rigveda 4) vii. 103. Cf. Av. iv. 15, 12, as explained by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 223, where reference is made to frogs in the clefts of the earth (Irin2a). compares with Brahmins the frogs croaking as they awake to activity at the beginning of the rains. It has been explained by Max Mu7ller 5) Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 494, 495. as a satire on the Brahmins. Geldner, 6) Rigveda, Kommentar, 117. agreeing with this view, thinks that it is directed by its Vasis2t2ha composer against rival Brahmins, probably the Vis4va1mitras. 7) Geldner, loc. cit., very plausibly points out that the last Pa1da of this Vasis2t2ha hymn is borrowed from the most important Vis4va1mitra hymn (Rv. iii. 53, 7). The view, however, which interprets the hymn as a rain charm 8) Ya1ska, Nirukta, ix. 5; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 173-179. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 151; Sanskrit Literature, 121, 122. seems on the whole more likely. The frog, from its connexion with water, was considered to have cooling properties. Thus after the burning of the dead body the frog is invited to come to the spot where the cremation has taken place in order to cool it down. 9) Rv. x. 16, 14. See Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 342350; Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 850. Similarly the frog is invoked in the Atharvaveda against the fire of fever. 10) Av. vii. 116. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 565. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95.

मत्स्य
1. Matsya, ‘fish,’ is mentioned only once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 68, 8. but frequently later. 2) Av. xi. 2, 25; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 9, 5; 14, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 21, 34; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 6, 1; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 1, 1 (the famous fish of the deluge legend); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 4, 3; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 2; maha1-matsya, ‘great fish,’ Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 18. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 3, 12 (cf. A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 7, 8; Sa1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 2, 23), a Matsya Sa1m2mada is personfied as the king of the fishes.

मत्स्य
2. Matsya appears to be the name of a people in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vii. 18, 6. where they are ranged with the other enemies of Suda1s, although it is possible to see merely the sense of ‘fish’ in that passage. In the list of As4vamedhins, ‘offerers of the horse sacrifice,’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) xiii. 5, 4, 9. Dhvasan Dvaitavana is mentioned as a Matsya king (Ma1tsya). The Matsyas as a people occur also in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 3) iv. 1. in connexion with the Vas4as, 4) This is the most probable reading, which results from a comparison with Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 9, where S4a1lva-Matsyes2u is followed by savas4aUs4i1nares2u (misprinted s4avas4a-). See Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 367. The older view was SatvanMatsyes2u, Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 1, lxxvii, following Cowell; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Satvant. and in the Gopatha Bra1hman2a 5) i. 2, 9. in connexion with S4a1lvas. In Manu 6) ii. 19; vii. 193. the Kuruks2etra, the Matsyas, the Panca1las, and the S4u1rasenakas comprise the land of the Brahmin R2s2is (brahmars2i-des4a). There is no reason to doubt that the Matsyas occupied much the same territory as in Epic times, say Alwar, Jaipur, Bharatpur. 7) See Vincent Smith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 56, 675.

मदुघ
मदुघ,
 ‘honey-plant,’ 1) The literal meaning is probably ‘yielding honey,’ the word being, according to the commentator, derived from madhu-dugha, a word actually occurring in the Rigveda (vi. 70, 1. 5). is the name of a sweet herb in the Atharvaveda. 2) i. 34, 4; vi. 102, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 386, n.; 404; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 34, 35, 355; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 275; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69. The spelling is somewhat uncertain, since many manuscripts read Madhugha. 3) These two forms probably stand by haplology for ma[dhu]-dugha and madhu-[du]gha. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 64, 1a.

मद्गु
मद्गु,
 ‘diver’ (from the root majj, 1) See Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 38c; 44a 3a. ‘dive’), is the name of some aquatic bird which is included in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 20, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 22. 34. and is occasionally mentioned elsewhere. 3) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 8, 1. 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. 

मद्य
मद्य,
 ‘intoxicating liquor,’ is not mentioned until the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 1) v. 11, 5. The word is found in the Epic and often in the Dharmas4a1stras, as well as in medical texts. where it occurs in the compound madya-pa1, ‘drinking intoxicating liquor.’

मद्र
मद्र
 denotes a people who are mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad; 1) iii. 3, 1; 7, 1 Ka1pya Patan5cala was then living among them. Their name appears elsewhere in Vedic literature, only in that of a branch, the Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras,’ who are referred to in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 2) viii. 14, 3 as living beyond the Hima1laya (paren2a Himavantam) in the neighbourhood of the Uttara Kurus, probably, as Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 102. conjectures, in the land of Kas4mi1r. The Madras mentioned in the Upanis2ad were, like the Kurus, probably settled somewhere in Kuruks2etra in the Madhyades4a or ‘Middle Land.’ Cf. Madraga1ra.

मद्रगारशौङ्गायनि
मद्र-गार शौङ्गायनि
 (‘descendant of S4un3ga’) is the name of a teacher, whose pupil was Ka1mboja Aupamanyava in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 102. concludes, with probability, that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas and the Madras.

मधु
मधु
 denotes anything sweet used as food, and especially drink, ‘mead,’ 1) The word is etymologically identical with Greek , ‘intoxicating drink,’ and Anglo-Saxon medu, ‘mead.’ a sense often found in the Rigveda. 2) Used as an adjective, ‘sweet,’ in Rv. i. 90, 6. 8; 187, 2; iii. 1, 8; iv. 34, 2; 42, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxviii. 10, etc.; as a substantive, Rv. i. 154, 4; ii. 37, 5; iii. 39, 6; iv. 38, 10, etc.; Av. vi. 69, 1; ix. 1, 22; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 2, 4, 13, etc. More precisely it denotes either ‘Soma’ 3) Rv. i. 19, 9; ii. 19, 2; 34, 5; 36, 4; iii. 43, 3; iv. 18, 13, etc. or ‘milk,’ 4) Rv. i. 117, 6; 169, 4; 177, 3; iii. 8, 1; vii. 24, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vi. 2, etc. or less often ‘honey,’ 5) Rv. viii. 4, 8 (where the sense is made certain by the adjective sa1ragha, ‘derived from the bee’); perhaps also iv. 45, 4; vii. 32, 2; viii. 24, 20, and, according to Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 239 et seq., in many other passages; Av. ix. 1, 17, 19; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 10, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 9, 7; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 15; viii. 5. 20; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 2, 1. 2; xi. 5, 4, 18; Br2hada1ran2yaka, ii. 5, 1; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 9, 1, etc. which, however, is the most definite sense in the later literature.

मध्य-देश,
 the ‘Middle Country,’ is, according to the Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra, 1) ii. 21. the land between the Hima1laya in the north, the Vindhya in the south, Vinas4ana in the west, and Praya1ga (now Allahabad) in the east--that is, between the place where the Sarasvati1 disappears in the desert, and the point of the confluence of the Yamuna1 (Jumna) and the Gan3ga1 (Ganges). The same authority 2) ii. 19. defines Brahmars2i-des4a as denoting the land of Kuruks2etra, the Matsyas, Pan5ca1las, and S4u1rasenakas, and Brahma1varta 3) ii. 17. 19. as meaning the particularly holy land between the Sarasvati1 and the Dr2s2advati1. The Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra 4) i. 2, 9; Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, i. 8. defines A1rya1varta as the land east of Vinas4ana; west of the Ka1laka-vana, ‘Black Forest,’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardva1r; south of the Hima1laya; and north of the Pa1riya1tra or the Pa1ripa1tra Mountains; adding that, in the opinion of others, 5) Baudha1yana, i. 2, 10; Vasis2t2ha, i. 12. See on Kanakhala, Hultzsch, Indian Antiquary, 34, 179. it was confined to the country between the Yamuna1 and the Gan3ga1, while the Bha1llavins 6) Baudha1yana, i. 2, 11. 12; Vasis2t2ha, i. 14. 15, quoting in each case a verse of the Nida1na (what work is referred to is not certain; there is similar doubt as to the quotation in the Nida1na of the Bha1llavi Bra1hman2a, according to the Br2haddevata1, v. 23, where see Macdonell's note, and cf. Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 3, n.). took it as the country between the boundary-river (or perhaps the Saras vati1) 7) The readings are doubtful, varying between sindhur vidha1ran2i1 or vidharan2i1 and sindhur vicaran2i1 or visavan2i1. The latter expression must refer to the Sarasvati1; the former may, but not necessarily. Conceivably the Sindhu (Indus) is meant; for it was a great boundary, with A1ryan tribes to the east of it. and the region where the sun rises. The Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra, 8) ii. 22. in accord with the Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, 9) i. 9. defines A1rya1varta as the region between the Vindhya and the Hima1laya, the two ranges which seem to be the boundaries of the A1ryan world in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad also. 10) ii. 13. Cf. Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 28, n. 1. The term Madhyades4a is not Vedic, but it is represented in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 11) viii. 14, 3. The Us4i1naras may be recognized as in the north, for the Buddhist texts give Usi1ragiri as the northern boundary of the middle country. See Hultzsch, Indian Antiquary, 34, 179. by the expression madhyama1 pratis2t2ha1 dis4, ‘the middle fixed region,’ the inhabitants of which are stated to be the Kurus, the Pan5ca1las, the Vas4as, and the Us4i1naras. The latter two peoples practically disappear later on, the Madhyades4a being the country of the Kuru-Pan5ca1las, the land where the Bra1hman2as and the later Sam2hita1s were produced, bounded on the east by the Kosala-Videhas, and on the west by the desert. The western tribes are mentioned with disapproval both in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 12) ix. 3, 1, 8. and the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 13) iii. 44, 3; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 245. while the tradition of the Brahminization of the Kosalas and the Videhas from the Kuru-Pan5ca1la country is preserved in the former Bra1hman2a. 14) i. 4, 1. Cf. Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 2, 3; 146, 147, who points out that the Pa1ripa1tra Mountains are a part of the Vindhya range in Ma1lva1, and who suggests that the western boundary was originally the A1dars4a Mountains; for the reading of the manuscripts, and of the scholiast Kr2s2n2apan2d2ita, in the Vasis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, i. 8, is pra1g a1dars4ana1t, not adars4ana1t (corresponding with the Vinas4ana of Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, i. 2, 9), and the Maha1bha1s2ya on Pa1n2ini, ii. 4, 10, has pra1g a1dars4a1t. See also for the Buddhist ‘Middle Country’ an article by Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1904, 83 et seq., with Fleet's corrections, ibid., 1907, 657; and cf. Keith, ibid., 1908, 1143; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 58, 59; Indian Empire, 1, 303, 304, where the extraordinary theory is adopted that the Madhyades4a was peopled by a new race of immigrant A1ryans, who, travelling via10 Chitral and Gilgit, and bringing no women with them, married Dravidian women, and produced the so-called A1ryo-Dravidians. It is quite impossible to find any support for this theory in Vedic literature. To say, as is there said, that the ‘Vedic hymns contain no reference to the route by which the A1ryans entered India or to their earlier settlements on the Indus,’ and that this is explained by the theory of the entry of the Vedic Indians via10 Chitral, is to assert absurdities. The theory is based on the later dialects and their affinities (see Grierson, Indian Empire, 1, 357 et seq.); it can probably not be regarded as at all valid for any period--at any rate, it is not cogent for the eighth century, B.C. 

मध्यंदिन
मध्यं-दिन,
 ‘mid-day,’ is a frequent designation of time in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 28, 3; viii. 1, 29; 13, 13; 27, 19; x. 151, 5, etc. the later Sam2hita1s, 2) Av. ix. 6, 46; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 5, 4, etc. and the Bra1hman2as. 3) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xv. 9, 16; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 3, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 3, 9; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, ii. 9, 6; 14, 1, etc. The word is sometimes used as an abbreviation for the ‘midday libation’ (like mittag in German for ‘midday meal’) in Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 2, 5; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxix. 8. Cf. Ahan.

मध्यमवह्
मध्यम-वह्
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) ii. 29, 4. as an epithet of the chariot. The exact interpretation is doubtful. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 210. The context seems to require the sense of ‘keeping away’ from the sacrifice. Cf. Pu1rvavah. assigns to it the expression the sense of ‘driving with a single horse between the shafts.’ According to Sa1yana's explanation, it means ‘driving with middling speed.’ It might mean ‘driving in the middle’--that is, ‘only half-way.’^3

मध्यमशी
मध्यम-शी
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 97, 12 = Av. iv. 9, 4 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 86. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. assigns to the word the meaning of intercessor, which Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 180. Cf. Dharma. accepts, in the sense of ‘mediator’ or ‘arbiter,’ as a legal term, but which Roth may, as Lanman 4) In Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 159. But see Roth, Siebenzig Lieder, 174, which Lanman may have overlooked, since he does not refer to it. suggests, have intended to express ‘adversary’ or ‘preventer’ of the disease referred to in the hymn. Whitney 5) Loc. cit. thinks that it means ‘mid most man’ or ‘chief’ as the one round whom his followers encamp. 6) Madhyamas4ivan, in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 408, is obscure. Geldner, 7) Rigveda, Glossar, 131; Kommentar, 196 (where he seems to decide in favour of derivation from s4i1, not s4r2). however, thinks that a third king, who is ‘neutral’ between two enemies, is intended.

 occurring in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) v. 44, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139. seems clearly to be the name of a R2s2i, in accordance with Sa1yan2a's interpretation.

मना
मना
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 78, 2. in an enumeration of gifts, where it is described as ‘golden’ (saca1 mana1 hiran2yaya1). It therefore seems to designate some ornament, or possibly a weight, and has accordingly been compared 2) As. e.g., by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 50, 51; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 386; 17, 202, 203; Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xxii; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278. with the Greek  (Herodotus has ), the Latin mina. All three words have been considered Semitic in origin, as borrowed from the Phœnicians 3) Or perhaps from Babylon via10 Asia Minor. The part played by the Phœnicians in Greek life is now reduced within narrow limits; in the case of the mina, probably their commercial activities may be considered as likely to have caused the adoption of the term. in the case of Greece, from Carthage by way of Etruria or Sicily in the case of Rome, and from Babylon in the case of India. The identification as regards Mana1 is very conjectural, depending merely on the probabilities of Babylonian borrowing 4) See, e.g., for borrowing, Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 276; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 50, 43 et seq.; Bu7hler, Indian Studies, 3, 16 et seq.; Indische Palœographie, 17; Vincent Smith, Indian Antiquary, 34, 230. On the other side, cf. Max Mu7ller, India, 133-138; Hopkins, Religions of India, 160; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 139 (as regards the flood legend): Bloomfield, Religions of India, 133 et seq. (as regards the A1dityas). seen--e.g., in the legend of the flood, and in the system of the Naks2atras. On the other hand, Maha1 may very well be identical with the word mana1 which occurs several times in the Rigveda 5) i. 173, 2; iv. 33, 2, x. 6, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 19; ‘jealousy, Rv. ii. 33, 5, Kans4ika Su1tra, cvii. 2. There are also the derivatives mana1-ya, ‘think of,’ ‘be zealous’: Rv. i. 133, 4; ii. 26, 2; mana1-ya, ‘desirous’: Rv. i. 92, 9; iv. 24, 7; mana1-vasu, ‘rich in devotion’: Rv. v. 74, 1. in the sense of ‘desire’ (from the root man, ‘think’), and which may have in this one passage the concrete sense of ‘desirable object.’ It is to be noted that in Bo7htlingk's Dictionary a single word Mana1 appears, to which the only senses assigned are ‘wish,’ ‘desire,’ ‘jealousy.’

मनावी

Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 38. ‘descendant of Sam2varan2a.’ The first name is, of course, mythical. The other two have been regarded as historical, Sa1varn2i being taken by Ludwig 8) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 195; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, 240; Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 114 et seq.; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Muir, Sanskrit texts, 1^2, 161 et seq.; Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 25, lvii et seq.; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 340 et seq. as a king of the Turvas4as, but this is very doubtful.

मन्था
मन्था
 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 28, 4. seems to mean a ‘churn.’ So the root math denotes to ‘churn’ in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 2) ii. 2, 10, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 2, 6; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 6, 1.

मन्थावल
मन्थावल
 is the name of an animal in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) iii. 26, 3. a sort of snake according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Sa1yan2a 2) P. 291 (ed. Aufrecht). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. understands it to be a kind of animal which hangs head downwards from the branches of trees, meaning, presumably, the flying fox. 3) This is the probable meaning of the word according to Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v.

मन्दीर
मन्दीर
 is perhaps the name of a man whose cattle, according to a Mantra in the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xiii. 3, 21), did not drink the water of the Gan3ga1 (Ganges). See Man3gi1ra.

मन्धातृ
1. Mandha1tr2 occurs in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 13; viii. 39, 8; 40, 12; x. 2, 2. in all of which Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. takes the word as merely an adjective used substantively, ‘the pious man.’ In one passage 3) Rv. x. 2, 2. the word, being applied to Agni, is thus used, but in another 4) Rv. viii. 40, 12. Mandha1tr2vat being parallel with An3girasvat, ‘like An3giras,’ is naturally to be understood as a proper name, which is probably also the sense of the word in the preceding hymn. 5) Rv. viii. 39, 8. A different Mandha1tr2 6) Rv. i. 112, 13. may be meant in the first Man2d2ala, 6) Rv. i. 112, 13. where he is mentioned as a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, and evidently as a king. To equate these persons, and make a Ra1jars2i out of Mandha1tr2, as Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. where he attributes Rv. viii. 39-42 to him as a Na1bha1ka, ‘descendant of Nabha1ka.’ and Griffith 8) Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 147. do, is unnecessary and improbable. 

मन्धातृयौवनाश्व
2. Mandha1tr2 Yauvana1s4va (‘descendant of Yuvana1s4va’) is in the Gopatha Bra1hman2a 1) i. 2, 10 et seq. Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 111. the name of an emperor who was instructed by Vica1rin, son of Kabandha A1tharvan2a.

मन्या
मन्या
 (plur.), ‘nape of the neck,’ occurs in a passage of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 25, 1. directed against a disease which Bloomfield 2) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1887, xix; American Journal of Philology, 11, 327 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 472. regards as scrofulous swellings on the neck. He compares the disease Manskunder, ‘tumours of the neck’ (which looks like a combination of the words manya1 and skandhya1, ‘pains of the neck and shoulders,’ both occurring in verses 1 and 3 of the Atharvan hymn), mentioned by Wise. 3) System of Hindu Medicine, 316. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 202; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 298, 299.

ममता
ममता
 is, according to Sa1yan2a, in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 10, 2. Cf. Maha1bha1rata, i. 4179 et seq. the wife of Ucathya and the mother of Di1rghatamas. But the word may be merely an abstract noun meaning ‘selfinterest,’ a sense which it often has in the later language. Oldenberg 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212. finds a mention of Mamata (masc.) in a verse of the Rigveda 3) vi. 50, 15, where the reading of the received text is mama tasya. as the name of a Bharadva1ja.

मय
मय
 is found once in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (xxii. 19) in the sense of ‘horse.’

मयु
मयु
 occurs in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 12, 1; Va1jasanevi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 31. The commentator on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 12, 1: Va1jasanevi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 31. explains the word as meaning either an ‘ape’ (kim2purus2a) or a ‘forest peacock’ (a1ran2ya-mayu1ra). The former sense is supported by another passage of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 2) viii. 47; mayu a1ran2ya in Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 10, 1. where the Mayu, being a substitute for the man, must be an ape. This sense also suits the word in the other passage 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 5, 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 246. where it occurs.

मयूख
मयूख
 denotes, from the Rigveda onwards, 1) Rv. vii. 99, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 1, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 15, 9. etc. a ‘peg,’ especially as used for keeping a web stretched. 2) Rv. x. 130, 2 (in a metaphor); Av. x. 7, 42; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvi. 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 5, 3, etc. Cf. Otu.

मयूर
मयूर,
 ‘peacock,’ occurs in the Rigveda in the compounds describing Indra's horses, mayu1ra-roman, 1) Rv. iii. 45, 1. ‘with hair like peacocks’ feathers,’ and mayu1ra-s4epya, 2) Rv. viii. 1, 25. ‘with tails like those of peacocks.’ The peacock also appears in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 3) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 23. 27. The pea-hen, Mayu1ri1, is mentioned in the Rigveda 4) i. 191, 14 (a late hymn). and the Atharvaveda, 5) vii. 56, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90. in both cases with reference to the bird's efficacy against poison, a curious superstition to be compared with the modern dislike of peacocks' feathers.

मरीचि
मरीचि
 in the plural denotes according to Weber, 1) Indische Studien, 9, 9, accepted by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the ‘particles of light’ or ‘shining motes’ that fill the air, as opposed to rays of light (ras4mi). This meaning adequatelysuits the passages in the early Vedic literature 2) Rv. x. 57, 12; 177, 1; Av. iv. 38, 5 (where ras4mi and mari1ci are opposed); v. 27, 10; vi. 113, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 5, 5 (mari1ci-pa, ‘drinking atoms of light,’ said of the gods); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 9, 2 (where Sa1yan2a's version, sarvatra-prasr2taprabha1-dravya, refers to the light as everywhere diffused), etc. where the word occurs; but the sense of ‘ray’ is quite clearly found in the Upanis2ads, 3) Pras4na Upanis2ad, iv. 2. Cf. Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, i. 1, 2; 2, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Upanis2ad, vi. 31. as well as the older sense. 4) Aitareya Upanis2ad, i. 2.

मरु
मरु,
 in the plural, is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, 1) v. 1, 1. as the utkara (‘mound of earth thrown up’ from the excavation of the altar 2) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, xii. 25, 54. ) of Kuruks2etra. This seems to mean that the Maru deserts (the later Maru-sthala) 3) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 48, and Dhanvan. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78. were so called because they stood to the ‘altar,’ Kuruks2etra, in the same relation as the waste earth of the utkara to the altar at the sacrifice.

मरुत्तआविक्षित
मरुत्त आवि-क्षित
 (‘descendant of Aviks2it’) Ka1ma-pri (‘descendant of Ka1mapra’) is the name of a king who was anointed by Sam2varta according to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) viii. 21, 12. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 5, 4, 6. Cf. also S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 9, 14. 16; Maitra1yan2i1 Upanis2ad, i. 4. account of the same king he is called A1yogava.

मरुद्वृधा
मरुद्-वृधा
 1) Literally, ‘rejoicing in the Maruts’ -i.e., ‘swollen by the rainy winds.’ The misspelling of the name as Marudvr2ddha1 in Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 80, 88, is corrected in the Index and the Addenda of that work. On the accentuation of the name, see Va1rttika 2 on Pa1n2ini, vi. 2, 106. is the name of a stream mentioned in the Nadi1stuti (‘Praise of Rivers’) in the Rigveda 2) x. 75, 5. along with the Asikni1 (Akesines) and the Vitasta1 (Hydaspes). Roth 3) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 138 et seq. considers that the Marudvr2dha1 denotes the stream formed by the combined waters of these two rivers down to its junction with the Parus2n2i1 (Ravi), a view accepted by Zimmer. 4) Altindisches Leben, 11, 12. On the other hand, Ludwig 5) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. thinks that the Marudvr2dha1 designates the stream formed by the junction of the Parus2n2i1 with the combined waters of the Asikni1 and Vitasta1, a view which seems less likely.

मर्क
1. Marka is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 27, 20. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. He thinks, however, that if the word means ‘eclipse,’ it cannot be derived from the root mr2c, ‘injure.’ sees in the expression su1ro markah2 the ‘eclipse of the sun.’ Sa1yan2a 3) As from the root mr2j, derivation from which is not phonetically justified. thinks the meaning is ‘purifying.’ 4) Ludwig cites this passage, in his essay on eclipses in the Rigveda (Proceedings of the Bohemian Academy, 1885), as a proof that the Vedic R2s2is knew of the moon as eclipsing the sun; but see Whitney's reply, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, lxi et seq., and Su1rya.

मर्क
2. Marka is mentioned in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) vi. 4, 10, 1. and elsewhere 2) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 1, 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 2, 1, 4. as the Purohita, along with S4an2d2a, of the Asuras, while Br2haspati is, of course, the Purohita of the gods. Marka is mentioned elsewhere also. 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vii. 16, 17. The name may quite possibly have Iranian affinities, as believed by Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 442 et seq. and by Hopkins. 5) Cf. Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 49, n. 1. Hillebrandt 6) Op. cit., 1, 223 et seq. also sees in a Gr2dhra mentioned in the Rigveda 7) v. 77, 1. and elsewhere 8) Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iv. 29; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 9, 19. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 279 et seq. a prototype of Marka.

It is classified in the same Sam2hita1s 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 5, 7; Maita1yani Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 7. with man and the elephant as ‘taking hold by the hand’ (hasta1da1na) instead of ‘taking hold by the mouth’ (mukha1da1na). The animal is mentioned several times elsewhere also. 3) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 4; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 184; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iii. 11, 32, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85.

2. Marya 1) vii. 56, 16; viii. 43, 25. in several passages of the Rigveda 1) vii. 56, 16; viii. 43, 25. denotes a ‘stallion.’ 2) This is, of course, only a specialized sense of 1. Marya as meaning a ‘male’ (cf. Lat. mas, maritus). The specialized meaning is somewhat analogous to the use of ‘sire’ in English. It is once 3) Rv. ix. 97, 18. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2, thinks Rv. i. 91, 13, may have the same sense. described as pastya1vant, ‘a stalled horse’--that is, one carefully tended, and not allowed out to graze.

Usually the word is metaphorically employed. 2) Rv. iv. 5, 13; x. 5, 6; Av. vi. 81, 2 (of an amulet). In the Atharvaveda passage Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 392, suggests, owing to the very curious use of the word, the emendation marya-da1, ‘giver of a son.’

मल
मल
 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) x. 136, 2. is used of the garments of the Munis. The St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean a ‘leathern garment,’ 2) If this were correct, the word might be derived from mla1 in the sense of ‘to tan.’ Cf. Carman, especially notes 6 and 7. but Ludwig and Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 262. think it means only ‘soiled’ raiment, which, of course, suits the ordinary sense of the word (‘dirt’) in the Atharvaveda, 4) vi. 115, 3; vii. 89, 3; x. 5, 24, etc. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 333, n. and the character of the long-haired (kes4in) hermit (Muni). Cf. Malaga. 

मलग
मल-ग
 in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 3, 21. denotes a cleanser of clothes, a ‘washerman,’ but the origin of the word is somewhat uncertain. 2) It may, perhaps, have primarily meant ‘concerned with dirt.’ See the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. ga 1, on the use of ga as forming compounds; and cf. Mala. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 188.

 ‘advanced night,’ is a phrase found in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 9; xi. 8. and the Su1tras 2) S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vi. 2, 1; xvii. 7, 1, etc. to denote the latter part of the night, after midnight and before dawn.

It is reasonable to suppose that they were northerners, though Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 446. suggests that the name may be chosen more for its sound and sense (as ‘of mighty strength’ to resist the disease) than for its geographical position. In the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 3) iv. 2, 5. the place Raikvaparn2a is said to be in the Maha1vr2s2a country. The king of the Maha1vr2s2as in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 4) iii. 40, 2. is said to be Hr2tsva1s4aya.

In the parallel passage of the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad 3) v. 11, 1. the name is Pra1ci1nas4a1la Aupamanyava. 4) Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 393, n. 1. The word must be considered a proper name rather than an adjective (1. Maha1s4a1la), as it is taken in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. 5) In Mun2d2aka Upanis2ad, i. 1, 3, the word is used of S4aunaka, perhaps merely as an epithet. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 161.

Mahis2i1, ‘the powerful one,’ the name of the first of the four wives (see Pati) of the king, is mentioned frequently in the later literature. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 9, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xix. 1, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 5, 3, 1; vii. 5, 1, 6, etc. Perhaps even in the Rigveda 2) v. 2, 2; 37, 3. the technical sense of ‘first wife’ is present.

महैतरेय
महैतरेय
 is the title of a Vedic text according to the Gr2hya Su1tras of the R2gveda. 1) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 4, 4; of a teacher, in S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 10; vi. 1. Cf. Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 39; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 29, 3, 4.

महोक्ष
महोक्ष,
 a ‘great bull,’ is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (iii. 4, 1, 2).

मांस
मांस,
 ‘flesh.’ The eating of flesh appears as something quite regular in the Vedic texts, which show no trace of the doctrine of Ahim2sa1, or abstaining from injury to animals. For example, the ritual offerings of flesh contemplate that the gods will eat it, and again the Brahmins ate the offerings. 1) So Agni is called ‘eater of ox and cow’ in Rv. viii. 43, 11 = Av. iii. 21, 6 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 3, 14, 7; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 280, 281; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 355. Again, the slaying of a ‘great ox’ (mahoks2a) or a ‘great goat’ (maha1ja) for a guest was regularly prescribed; 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 2. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, ii. 15, 2. and the name Atithigva probably means ‘slaying cows for guests.’ 3) Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 426; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, cxxiv. Cf. atithini1r ga1h2, ‘cows fit for guests,’ Rv. x. 68, 3. The great sage Ya1jn5avalkya was wont to eat the meat of milch cows and bullocks (dhenv-anad2uha) if only it was am2sala (‘firm’ or ‘tender’). 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 2, 21. The sense of am2sala is given as sthu1la, firm,’ in the scholiast. Cf. Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vii. 2, 23-25. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 11, has tender.’ ‘Off the shoulder’ (am2sa) is also a possible version. The slaughter of a hundred bulls (uks2an) was credited to one sacrificer, Agastya. 5) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 11, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxi. 14, 5. The marriage ceremony was accompanied by the slaying of oxen, clearly for food. 6) Q.v. x. 85, 13. Cf. Winternitz, Das altindische Hochzeitsrituell, 33. That there was any general objection to the eating of flesh is most improbable. Sometimes it is forbidden, as when a man is performing a vow, 7) Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 1, 8. So a Brahmaca1rin is not to eat flesh. See Oldenberg, op. cit., 468, n. 3. The blood of an animal is always a somewhat mysterious and dangerous substance; hence taboos on meat-eating, which in another form arise from fear of the spirits of the dead (cf. Oldenberg, op. cit., 414, n. 1). See also S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 1, 29; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 588, n. 4. or its use is disapproved, as in a passage of the Atharvaveda, 8) vi. 70, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 493. where meat is classed with Sura1, or intoxicating liquor, as a bad thing. Again, in the Rigveda 9) x. 85, 13. In the Atharvaveda, xiv. 1, 13, the ordinary word Magha1s is found, and is, no doubt, really to be preferred. See Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1894, 807. the slaying of the cows is said to take place in the Agha1s, a deliberate variation for Magha1s; but this may be the outcome merely of a natural association of death with gloom, even when cows alone are the victims in question. The Bra1hman2as also contain the doctrine of the eater in this world being eaten in the next, 10) Cf. the story of Bhr2gu Va1run2i in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 1, 1 et seq.; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 42-44; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 1, 2, with Keith's notes (pp. 202, 203). but this is not to be regarded as a moral or religious disapproval of eating flesh, though it no doubt contains the germ of such a view, which is also in harmony with the persuasion of the unity of existence, which becomes marked in the Bra1hman2as. But Ahim2sa1 as a developed and articulate doctrine would seem to have arisen from the acceptance of the doctrine of transmigration, which in its fundamentals is later than the Bra1hman2a period. 11) Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 317 et seq.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 565. On the other hand, it is to be noted that the cow was on the road to acquire special sanctity in the Rigveda, 12) viii. 101, 15. 16; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 19, 20; Av. x. 10; xii. 4, 5; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 151. as is shown by the name aghnya1, 13) Found sixteen times in the Rigveda, as opposed to three instances of Aghnya (masculine); Macdonell, loc. cit. The sense of ‘hard to overcome,’ preferred by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, to that of ‘not to be killed,’ is, however, quite possible. Weber, op. cit., 17, 281, tries to derive the word from ahanya, ‘bright-coloured like dya,’ a derivation that must be regarded as illegitimate. ‘not to be slain,’ applied to it in several passages. But this fact cannot be regarded as showing that meat eating generally was condemned. Apart from mythical considerations, such as the identification of the cow with earth or Aditi (which are, of course, much more than an effort of priestly ingenuity), the value of the cow for other purposes than eating was so great as to account adequately for its sanctity, the beginnings of which can in fact be traced back to Indo-Iranian times. 14) Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 68. Moreover, the ritual of the cremation of the dead required the slaughter of a cow as an essential part, the flesh being used to envelope the dead body. 15) Rv. x. 16, 7. See Oldenberg, op. cit., 576. The usual food of the Vedic Indian, as far as flesh was concerned, can be gathered from the list of sacrificial victims: what man ate he presented to the gods--that is, the sheep, the goat, and the ox. The horse sacrifice was an infrequent exception: it is probably not to be regarded as a trace of the use of horseflesh as food, though the possibility of such being the case cannot be overlooked in view of the widespread use of horseflesh as food in different countries and times. It is, however, more likely that the aim of this sacrifice was to impart magic strength, the speed and vigour of the horse, to the god and his worshippers, as Oldenberg 16) Religion des Veda, 356, n. 4. As to meat-eating in Buddhist times, cf. the death of the Buddha from a meal of pork, Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 881, 882; Oldenberg, Buddha,^5 231, n. 2 (contra Neumann, Die Reden des Gotamo Buddho, 1, xix). As to meat-eating in the Epic, see Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 119, 120; Great Epic of India, 377-379; and see for modern instances Jolly, Deutsche Rundschau, July, 1884. 118; Bu7hler, Report, 23. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 316; Hopkins, Religions of India, 156, 189. argues.

He seems to be mentioned also in one other passage, possibly in two. 2) Rv. x. 48, 2; 105, 6. The former reference is much more probable than the latter. In the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 3) xvi. 11, 26; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 39, 40. The manuscripts vary between Ma1taris4van and Ma1taris4va. Cf.

मातुर्भ्रात्र
मातुर्-भ्रात्र
 is a curiously formed compound, occurring once in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 1) i. 6, 12. as a designation of the ‘maternal uncle,’ who in the Su1tra period bears the name of Ma1tula. Thus little is heard of the maternal uncle in the Vedic period: it is not till the Epic 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 141. that traces appear of his prominence as compared with the paternal uncle (pitr2vya). This fact is significant for the ‘patriarchal’ character of the early Indian family organization. 3) Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 484, 586-588. Cf. also Rivers, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 629 et seq.

मातुल

See von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 412. The relations of wife and husband, as well as of mother and children, are treated under Pati. It remains only to add that details are given in the Su1tras 5) Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 460, 476, 477. of the respectful attention paid to a mother, and of the ceremonies in which she is concerned. The mother also appears interested in the fate of her children as in the story of the sale of S4unah2s4epa for adoption by Vis4va1mitra in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 6) vii. 18 seq. Cf. also Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 104; Jolly, Die Adoption in Indien, 16, 17. In the household the mother ranked after the father (see Pitr2). Occasionally ma1tara1 is used for ‘parents,’ as are also pitara1 and ma1tara1 pitara1 7) Rv. iii. 33, 3; vii. 2, 5, etc. For ma1tara1 pitara1, see Rv. iv. 6, 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 19. and ma1ta1-pitarah2. 8) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 3, 10, vi. 3, 11, 3.

मान
1. Ma1na as a measure of weight is said to be the equivalent of the Kr2s2n2ala or Raktika1--that is, the berry of the Gun5ja1 (Abrus precatorius).

Cf. verse 10. apparently the same meaning applies to Ma1na--that is, Agastya as ‘a Ma1na.’ In a third passage 4) i. 117, 11. the expression su1nave Ma1nena has been held by Sieg 5) Loc. cit. to be an inversion of Ma1nasya su1nuna1, ‘by the son of Ma1na’--i.e., Agastya; but it seems more likely 6) Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, loc. cit. that either su1nor Ma1na is the fuller form of Agastya's name (‘pride of the son,’ with reference to his high ancestry), or that the son 7) Bergaigne, loc. cit.; Pischel, loc. cit. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., where su1noh2 is taken as dependent on va1jam. of Ma1na (= Agastya) is alluded to as interested in Vis4pala1.

मारुताश्व
मारुताश्व,
 ‘descendant of Maruta1s4va,’ is, according to Ludwig, 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155. It may be a patronymic of Cyavata1na. the patronymic of a patron in the Rigveda. 2) v. 33, 9. The word may, however, be merely an adjective ‘having windswift horses.’

मास
मास
 denotes a ‘month,’ a period of time repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda and later. The characteristic days (or rather nights) of the month were those of the new moon, Ama1-vasya1, ‘home-staying (night),’ and ‘of the full moon,’ Paurn2a-ma1si1. Two hymns of the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 79 and 80. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 1, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, 5, 13, etc. celebrate these days respectively. A personification of the phases of the moon is seen in the four names Sini1va1li1, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 8, 1;  iii. 4, 9, 1; Rv. ii. 32, 6; Av. ii. 26, 2; vi. 11, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 55. 56; xxxiv. 10; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 8; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 6. the day before new moon; Kuhu1, 3) Av. vii. 47; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 8, 1; iii. 4, 9, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 8, etc. also called Gun3gu1, 4) Rv. ii. 32, 8, where Sa1yan2a identifies it with Kuhu1. the new moon day; Anumati, 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 8, 1; iii. 4, 9, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxix. 60; xxxiv. 8, 9; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 6. the day before full moon; and Ra1ka1, 6) Rv. ii. 32, 4; v. 42, 12; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 8, 1; iii. 4, 9, 1.

The importance of the new and full moon days is seen in the Dars4a-pu1rn2ama1sau, or festivals of the new and full moon days respectively. One special day in the month, the Eka1s2t2aka1, or eighth day after full moon, was important. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 7) x. 3, 11. Cf. Satapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 2, 23; Av. xv. 16, 2. there are stated to be in the year twelve such, mentioned between the twelve days of full moon and the twelve days of new moon. But one Eka1s2t2aka1 is referred to in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s and elsewhere 8) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 8, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 9, 1. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 8, 4; iv. 3, 11, 3; v. 7, 2, 2; Av. iii. 10; viii. 9, 10; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxix. 10; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 13, 21, etc. See Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiii. 1, 2, with the commentary; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, loc. cit., with Sa1yan2a's notes; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 341, 342; Indische Studien, 17, 219 et seq. as of quite special importance. This was, in the accordant opinion of most commentators, the eighth day after the full moon of Ma1gha. It marked the end of the year, or the beginning of the new year. Though the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 9) xix. 23. places the winter solstice in the new moon of Ma1gha, the latter date probably means the new moon preceding full moon in Ma1gha, 10) So Vina1yaka on Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, loc. cit.; A1narti1ya on S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiii. 19, 1; Weber, op. cit., 2, 345, 346, 353, 354. Weber accepts the scholiasts’ view that Ma1gha is here regarded as beginning with the day after full moon in Tais2a; but it is simpler to suppose the meaning to be that Ma1gha is regarded as commencing with, not after, the new moon and ending with the day before new moon. Several passages in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (ii. 12; iii. 1; xxvi. 18; xxx. 3; see Caland, U7ber das vituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 36, 37) and Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, i. 3; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 1, 1, 7, point to the full moon being the middle of the month, and the new moon being regarded as either the beginning or the end. Hopkins (n. 11) thinks Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 2, 18, point to the commencement of the month with the full moon. If this could be accepted, then the As2t2aka1 would fall a week before the winter solstice in Ma1gha. not the new moon following full moon; but it is perhaps possible to account adequately for the importance of the Eka1s2t2aka1 as being the first As2t2aka1 after the beginning of the new year. It is not certain exactly how the month was reckoned, whether from the day after new moon to new moon--the system known as ama1nta, or from the day after full moon to full moon--the pu1rn2ima1nta system, which later, at any rate, was followed in North India, while the other system prevailed in the south. Jacobi 11) Zeitschrfit der Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 229, n. 1; 50, 81. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 20. argues that the year began in the full moon of Pha1lguna, and that only by the full moon's conjunction with the Naks2atra could the month be known. Oldenberg 12) Ibid., 48, 633, n. 1; 49, 476, 477. This is the Epic rule, Hopkins, loc. cit. points to the fact that the new moon is far more distinctively an epoch than the full moon; that the Greek, Roman, and Jewish years began with the new moon; and that the Vedic evidence is the division of the month into the former (pu1rva) and latter (apara) halves, the first being the bright (s4ukla), the second the dark (kr2s2n2a) period. Thibaut 13) Indian Antiquary, 24, 87. None of the evidence is absolutely conclusive one way or the other. It is perfectly possible that the usage of families or districts differed. Cf. Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 12. considers that to assume the existence of the pu1rn2ima1nta system for the Veda is unnecessary, though possible. Weber 10) So Vina1yaka on Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, loc. cit.; A1narti1ya on S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiii. 19, 1; Weber, op. cit., 2, 345, 346, 353, 354. Weber accepts the scholiasts’ view that Ma1gha is here regarded as beginning with the day after full moon in Tais2a; but it is simpler to suppose the meaning to be that Ma1gha is regarded as commencing with, not after, the new moon and ending with the day before new moon. Several passages in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (ii. 12; iii. 1; xxvi. 18; xxx. 3; see Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 36, 37) and Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, i. 3; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 1, 1, 7, point to the full moon being the middle of the month, and the new moon being regarded as either the beginning or the end. Hopkins (n. 11) thinks Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 2, 18, point to the commencement of the month with the full moon. If this could be accepted, then the As2t2aka1 would fall a week before the winter solstice in Ma1gha. assumes that it occurs in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a as held by the scholiasts. But it would probably be a mistake to press that passage, or to assume that the ama1nta system was rigidly accepted in the Veda: it seems at least as probable that the month was vaguely regarded as beginning with the new moon day, so that new moon preceded full moon, which was in the middle, not the end or the beginning of the month. That a month regularly had 30 days is established by the conclusive evidence of numerous passages in which the year is given 12 months and 360 days. This month is known from the earliest records, being both referred to directly and alluded to. 14) Rv. i. 164, 11. 14, 48; x. 189, 3; 190, 2; Av. iv. 35, 4; x. 7, 6; 8, 23; xiii. 3, 8, etc. It is the regular month of the Bra1hman2as, 15) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 8; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 12; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvi. 2, 3; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iii. 2; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 1; Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxvi. 10; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 5, 22. See also Weber, Naxatra, 2, 288; Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 8. and must be regarded as the month which the Vedic Indian recognized. No other month is mentioned as such in the Bra1hman2a literature; it is only in the Su1tras that months of different length occur. The Sa1maveda Su1tras 16) La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 8, 1 et seq.; Nida1na Su1tra, v. 11. 12; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 281-288. refer to (1) years with 324 days--i.e., periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each; (2) years with 351 days--i.e., periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each, plus another month of 27 days; (3) years with 354 days--i.e., 6 months of 30 days, and 6 with 29 days, in other words, lunar synodic years; (4) years with 360 days, or ordinary civil (sa1vana) years; (5) years with 378 days, which, as Thibaut 17) Op. cit., 8, 9. clearly shows, are third years, in which, after two years of 360 days each, 18 days were added to bring about correspondence between the civil year and the solar year of 366 days. But even the Sa1masu1tras do not mention the year of 366 days, which is first known to the Jyotis2a 18) verse 28. and to Garga. 19) Cited in the commentary on the Jyotis2a, 10. That the Vedic period was acquainted with the year of 354 days cannot be affirmed with certainty. Zimmer, 20) Altindisches Leben, 365, 366. indeed, thinks that it is proved by the fact that pregnancy is estimated at ten months, or sometimes a year. 21) Ten months is the period according to Rv. v. 78, 7-9; x. 184, 3; Av. i. 11, 6; iii. 23, 2; v. 25, 13; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 2, 4. 5 (ibid., ix. 5, 1, 63, a six months' embryo is alone able to live). A year is mentioned in Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, x. 1, 9 (ten months in vi. 1, 3); Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiii. 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 3, 8; xi. 5, 4, 6-11; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 22. But Weber 22) Naxatra, 2, 313, n. 1. may be right in holding that the month is the periodic month of 27 days, for the period is otherwise too long if a year is taken. On the other hand, the period of ten months quite well suits the period of gestation, if birth takes place in the tenth month, so that in this sense the month of 30 days may well be meant. The year of 12 months of 30 days each being admittedly quite unscientific, Zimmer 23) Op. cit., 369, 370. is strongly of opinion that it was only used with a recognition of the fact that intercalation took place, and that the year formed part of a greater complex, normally the five your Yuga or cycle. This system is well known from the Jyots2a: it consists of 62 months of 29(16/31) days each = 1, 830 days (two of these months being intercalary, one in the middle and one at the end), or 61 months of 30 days, or 60 months of 30(1/2) days, the unit being clearly a solar year of 366 days. It is not an ideal system, since the year is too long; 24) The Yuga is too long by nearly four days. The true year has 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds. Cf. Thibaut, op. cit., 24, 25. but it is one which cannot be claimed even for the Bra1hman2a period, during which no decision as to the true length of the year seems to have been arrived at. The references to it seen by Zimmer in the Rigveda 25) i. 164, 14; iii. 55, 18. These passages are, of course, obscure, but to interpret them as referring to the ten half years of the Yuga is particularly gratuitous. are not even reasonably plausible, while the pan5caka yuga, cited by him from the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 26) xvii. 13, 17. See also Thibaut, op. cit., 7, 8; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 91, and references. The most that can be said is that a tendency to accept five years as a convenient period for intercalation was arising, which ultimately appears developed in the Jyotis2a. But we cannot say that a year of 366 days is known until then. occurs only in a quotation in a commentary, and had no authority for the text itself. On the other hand, there was undoubtedly some attempt to bring the year of 360 days--a synodic lunar year--roughly into connexion with reality. A Sa1masu1tra 27) La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 8, has nothing of this, but Nida1na Su1tra, v. 12, 2, 5, is quite clear. treats it as a solar year, stating that he sun perambulates each Naxatra in 13(1/3) days, while others again evidently interpolated 18 days every third year, in order to arrive at some equality. But Vedic literature, from the Rigveda 28) i. 25, 8; perhaps 165, 15. downwards, 29) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 1, 5; vi. 2, 2, 29; xii. 2, 1, 8; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 12; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 13; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, x. 3, 2; xxiii. 2, 3; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, v. 4, 29; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 336, n. 1. teems with the assertion of the difficulty of ascertaining the month. The length is variously given as 30 days, 30) Av. xiii. 3, 8. 35 days, 31) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 5, 4, 5. or 36 days. 32) Ibid., ix. 1, 1, 43; 3, 3, 18. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 167, n. 1. Shamasastry, Gava1m Ayana, 122, interprets these passages in quite an impossible manner. There is no trace of a month of 35-36 days in the Epic: Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 42. The last number possibly indicates an intercalation after six years (6×6 = 36, or for ritual purposes 35), but for this we have no special evidence. There are many references 33) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 7, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxi. 5; xxxiv. 9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 8; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 8; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 3, 27; iii. 6, 4, 24; v. 4, 5, 23; vii. 2, 3, 9, etc.; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 10, 6. to the year having 12 or 13 months. The names of the months are, curiously enough, not at all ancient. The sacrificial texts of the Yajurveda give them in their clearest form where the Agnicayana, ‘building of the fire-altar,’ is described. 34) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 11, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 10; xxxv. 9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 8, 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 25; xiv. 6. 15. 16 27; xv. 57. These names are the following: (1) Madhu, (2) Ma1dhava (spring months, va1santika1v r2tu1); (3) S4ukra, (4) S4uci (summer months, grais2ma1v r2tu1); (5) Nabha (or Nabhas), 35) In Maitra1yan2i1, Ka1t2haka, and Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1s. See notes 34, 36. (6) Nabhasya (rainy months, va1rs2ika1v r2tu1); (7) Is2a, (8) U1rja (autumn months, s4a1rada1v r2tu1); (9) Saha (or Sahas), 35) In Maitra1yan2i1, Ka1t2haka, and Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1s. See notes 34, 36. (10) Sahasya (winter months, haimantika1v r2tu1); (11) Tapa (or Tapas), 35) In Maitra1yan2i1, Ka1t2haka, and Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1s. See notes 34, 36. (12) Tapasya (cool months, s4ais4ira1v r2tu1). There are similar lists in the descriptions of the Soma sacrifice 36) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 4, 14, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 3, 16; iv. 6, 7; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, iv. 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vii. 30 (where Is2 and U1rj appear as the names of the months). and of the horse sacrifice, 37) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 12, 13; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 31. all of them agreeing in essentials. There are other lists of still more fanciful names, 38) See, e.g., Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 7, 9, 1; iv. 7, 11, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 ix. 20; xviii. 28; xxii. 32; Ka1thaka Sam2hita1, xxxv. 10, Weber, 2, 349, 350. but these have no claim at all to represent actual divisions in popular use. It is doubtful if the list given above is more than a matter of priestly invention. Weber points out that Madhu and Ma1dhava later appear as names of spring, and that these two are mentioned in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 39) iv. 7, 2; v. 6, 16. as if actually employed; but the evidence is very inadequate to show that the other names of the months given in the list were in ordinary use. 40) Cases like that of nabhas, used by Mallina1tha on Meghadu1ta, i. 4, are merely scholastic. In some of these lists the intercalary month is mentioned. The name given to it in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 41) vii. 30; xxii. 31. is Am2hasaspati, while that given in the Taittiri1ya 42) i. 4, 14, 1. and Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1s 43) iii. 12, 13. is Sam2sarpa. The Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 44) xxxviii. 4. gives it the name of Malimluca, which also occurs elsewhere, along with Sam2sarpa, in one of the lists of fanciful names. 45) Ibid., xxxv. 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2ita1, xxii. 30. The Atharvaveda 46) v. 6, 4. describes it as sanisrasa, ‘slipping,’ owing no doubt to its unstable condition. The other method of naming the months is from the Naks2atras. It is only beginning to be used in the Bra1hman2as, but is found regularly in the Epic and later. The Jyotis2a 47) Verse 6 Yajus recension = verse 5 R2c recension: Weber, 2, 354 et seq. mentions that Ma1gha and Tapa were identical: this is the fair interpretation of the passage, which also involves the identification of Madhu with Caitra, a result corresponding with the view frequently found in the Bra1hman2as, that the full moon in Citra1, and not that in Phalguni1, is the beginning of the year. 48) Weber's theory (359) that Caitra was as the first spring month secondary to Pha1lguna is, of course, an error; for, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, Pha1lguna became the first month of spring de facto, while Caitra became virtually the last month of the preceding season. The truth is that the six seasons are an arbitrary division of the year, and that either Pha1lguna or Caitra could be regarded as the beginning of spring without much impropriety. See Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 457; 10, 231, 232; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 71, 397, 398. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 49) viii. 4, 2, 12; 3, 18. See Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 26. 31. The Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 10, 3, has the words in the form of ya1va and aya1va, which are explained in v. 3, 4, 5. are found two curious expressions, yava and ayava, for the light and dark halves of the month, which is clearly considered to begin with the light half. Possibly the words are derived, as Eggling 50) Sacred Books of the East, 43, 69, n. thinks, from yu, ‘ward off,’ with reference to evil spirits. The word Parvan (‘joint’ = division of time) probably 51) The months and the half months are the parva1n2i of the sacrificial horse in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 1, 1. Cf.

माहीन
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 60, 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. which celebrates Asama1ti as a king. The word, used in the plural, may be a patronymic referring to the priests who praised Asama1ti, or it may be an adjective of uncertain meaning.

मुक्षीजा
मुक्षीजा
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 125, 2; Nirukta, v. 19. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 244. where the sense seems clearly to be ‘net’ for catching animals. Cf. Padi.

1. Mun5ja denotes a grass, the Saccharum Mun5ja, which is of luxuriant growth, attaining to a height of ten feet. It is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 3. along with other kinds of grasses as the lurking-place of venomous creatures. In the same text 2) i. 161, 8 (mun5ja-nejana, which Sa1yan2a explains as apagata-tr2n2a, ‘with the grass removed’). the Mun5ja grass is spoken of as purifying, apparently being used as the material of a filter for Soma.

Apparently the word is a patronymic, ‘son of Udanya’ (so Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 341, n. 1), or ‘son of Odana’ (so St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.). and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 15, 3 (‘descendant of Udanyu’).

मुद्ग
मुद्ग,
 denoting a kind of bean (Phascolus Mungo), occurs in a list of vegetables in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 1) xviii. 12. A ‘soup of rice with beans’ (mudgaudana) is mentioned in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 2) xii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 240. and the Su1tras. Cf. perhaps Mudgala.

मुद्गल
मुद्गल
 and Mudgalani1, ‘Mudgala's wife,’ both figure in a hopelessly obscure hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 102. variously interpreted by Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 124. and Geldner 3) Ibid., 1, 138; 2, 1-22. and von Bradke 4) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 46, 445 et seq. as telling of a real chariot race in which, despite difficulties, Mudgala won by his wife's aid. The Indian tradition is as variant as the interpretations of modern authorities. S2ad2gurus4is2ya 5) Macdonell's edition of the Sarva1nukraman2i1, p. 158. explains that Mudgala's oxen were stolen, that he pursued the thieves with the one old ox he had left, and that hurling his hammer (dru-ghan2a) he caught the marauders. Ya1ska, 6) Nirukta, ix. 23, 24. on the other hand, says that Mudgala won a race with a drughan2a and an ox instead of with two oxen. It is pretty clear that, as Roth 7) Nirukta, Erla7nterungen, 129. observed, the tradition is merely a guess, and a bad one, at the meaning of an obscure hymn, and this view is accepted by Oldenberg. 8) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 39, 78. Bloomfield 9) Ibid., 48, 547. has interpreted the legend as one of heavenly, not of human, events. Mudgala, probably a variant form of Mudgara, 10) According to Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 1, Indrasena1 in x. 102, 2, is the name of Mudgala1ni1; but its sense, ‘Indra's bolt,’ rather indicates the mythical character of the passage. which in the later language means a hammer or a similar weapon, may be meant as a personfication of the thunderbolt of Indra, rather than a real man. 11) If the name means a real man, it may be connected with Mudga, ‘bean.’ See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 240. Later 12) Av. iv. 29, 6; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 12; Br2haddevata1, vi. 46; viii. 12. 90. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166, 167; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 280; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 1911, 1005, n. 1. Mudgala is a mythical sage.

मुनि
मुनि
 occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 136, 2. 4. 5. In verse I he is described as ‘long-haired.’ where it seems to denote an ascetic of magic powers with divine afflatus (deves2ita), the precursor of the strange ascetics of later India. This agrees with the fact that Aitas4a, the Muni, is in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 2) vi. 33, 3. regarded by his son as deranged, a view not unjustified if the nonsense which passes as the Aitas4aprala1pa. 3) See Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 98 et seq. ‘Chatter of Aitas4a,’ was really his. The Rigveda 4) viii. 17, 14. Cf. vii. 56, 8; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 376. calls Indra the ‘friend of Munis,’ and the Atharvaveda 5) vii. 74, 1. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 440; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 5, 2, 15, and Munimaran2a. refers to a ‘divine Muni’ (deva muni), by whom a similar ascetic may be meant. In the Upanis2ads 6) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 4, 1; iv. 4, 25; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 20. the Muni is of a more restrained type: he is one who learns the nature of the Brahman, the Absolute, by study, or sacrifice, or penance, or fasting, or faith (s4raddha1). It must not of course be thought that there is any absolute distinction between the older Muni and the later: in both cases the man is in a peculiar ecstatic condition, but the ideal of the Upanis2ads is less material than the earlier picture of the Muni, who is more of a ‘medicine man’ than a sage. Nor would it be wise to conclude from the comparative rareness of the mention of the Muni in the Vedic texts that he was an infrequent figure in Vedic times: he was probably not approved by the priests who followed the ritual, and whose views were essentially different from the ideals of a Muni, which were superior to earthly considerations, such as the desire for children and Daks2in2a1s. 7) Cf. {|Br2hada1ranyaka|} Upanis2ad, iii. 4, 1. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 406; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 480; Buddha,^5 36.

मुलालिन्
मुलालिन्
 (masc.) or Mula1li1 (fem.) is the name of some part of an edible lotus (perhaps the Nymphaea esculenta) in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 34. 5. Cf. Kaus4ika Su1tra, lxvi. 10; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 138; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 207.

मुषीवन्
 denotes ‘robber’ in one passage of the Rigveda (i. 42, 3).

मुष्कर
मुष्कर
 occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 14, 2. possibly in the sense of a small animal or insect, as suggested by Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. who, however, thought the passage corrupt. Bloomfield 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 463, 464. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 297. suggests that the reading of the Paippala1da text pus2karam, (‘blue lotus’) is the correct form.

मुष्टिहन्
मुष्टि-हन्,
 1) Rv. v. 58, 4; vi. 26, 2; viii. 20, 20; Av. v. 22, 4. Mus2t2i-hatya1, 2) Rv. i. 8, 2. in the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda denote. respectively, the ‘hand to hand fighter’--that is, the ordinary warrior as opposed to the charioteer, and the ‘fight’ itself. So also in the Atharvaveda 3) vii. 62, 1. the charioteer (rathin) is opposed to the foot-soldier (patti), and in the Rigveda 4) i. 100, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 297. the chariots are opposed to the troops (gra1ma) of the infantry. The parallel of the Greek and other A1ryan races shows that the Ks2atriyas were the fighters from chariots, while the ordinary host fought on foot.

मुसल
मुसल
 denotes a ‘pestle’ in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Av. x. 9, 26; xi. 3, 3; xii. 3, 13; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 8, 3, etc. and in the Bra1hman2as. 2) S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 5, 2, 7; in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 42, 44 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 235, 237), musalin means a ‘man armed with a club.’

मुहूर्त
मुहूर्त
 denotes a division of time, one-thirtieth of a day, or an hour of forty-eight minutes, in the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 1, 1 (for the names); 9, 7; 12, 9, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 4, 2, 18. 25. 27; 3, 20; xii. 3, 2, 5; x. 4, 4, 4, etc. In the Rigveda 2) iii. 33, 5; 53, 8. The sense of ‘moment’ is also common in the Bra1hman2as. Cf. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 9, 139 et seq.; Indische Streifen, 1, 92 et seq. the sense of ‘moment’ only is found. Cf. Ahan.

मूचीप
मूचीप
 or Mu1vi1pa is the variant in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xv. 26, 6) of the Mu1tiba of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a as the name of a barbarian tribe. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 67, n. 1.

मूजवन्त्
मूजवन्त्
 is the name of a people who, along with the Maha1vr2s2as, the Gandha1ris, and the Balhikas, are mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 22, 5, 7, 8. 14. Cf. Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 5. as dwelling far away, and to whom fever is to be banished. Similarly in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 6, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 7; xxxvi. 14; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 10. 20; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 61; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 2, 17. the Mu1javants are chosen as a type of distant folk, beyond which Rudra with his bow is entreated to depart. In the Rigveda 3) x. 34, 1. Soma is described as Maujavata, ‘coming from the Mu1javants,’ or, as Ya1ska 4) Nirukta, ix. 8. takes it, ‘from Mount Mu1javant.’ The Indian commentators 5) Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit.; Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 161, 8; Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra and Prayoga, cited by Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 63. agree with Ya1ska in taking Mu1javant as the name of a mountain, and though Hillebrandt 6) Op. cit., 1, 65. is justified in saying that the identification of Mu1javant by Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 29. with one of the lower hills on the south-west of Kas4mi1r lacks evidence, it is not reasonable to deny that Mu1javant was a hill from which the people took their name. Ya1ska 8) Loc. cit. Cf. Siddha1nta Kaumudi1 on Pa1n2ini, iv. 4, 110, where instead of Maujavata in Rv. x. 34, 1, Maun5javata is read. suggests that Mu1javant is equivalent to Mun5javant, which actually occurs later, in the Epic, 9) Maha1bha1rata, x. 785; xiv. 180. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198. as the name of a mountain in the Hima1laya.

मूत

 in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as 1) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvi. 14; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 10, 5; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 3, 8. denotes a ‘woven basket.’ Mu1taka means a ‘small basket.’ 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 2, 17.

मूतिब
मूतिब
 appears in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 18, 2. as the name of one of the barbarous peoples enumerated as nominally Vis4va1mitra's outcast offspring. The S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xv. 26, 6. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 358, 483. gives the name as Mu1ci1pa or Mu1vi1pa.

मृग
1. Mr2ga has the generic sense of ‘wild beast’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 173, 2; 191, 4; viii. 1, 20; 5, 36; x. 146, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. iv. 3, 6; x. 1, 26; xii. 1, 48 (su1kara, ‘boar’); xix. 38, 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 7, 10; xxiv. 11, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 31, 2; viii. 23, 3, etc. Sometimes it is qualified by the epithet ‘terrible’ (bhi1ma), 3) Rv. i. 154, 2; 190, 3; ii. 33, 11; 34, 1; x. 180, 2, etc. which indicates that a savage wild beast is meant. Elsewhere the buffalo is shown to be denoted by the epithet mahis2a, 4) Rv. viii. 69, 15; ix. 92, 6; x. 123, 4. ‘powerful,’ which later becomes the name of the buffalo. More particularly the word has the sense of an animal of the gazelle type. 5) Rv. i. 38, 5; 105, 7; vi. 75, 11; ix. 32, 4; Av. v. 21, 4 (not a certain instance); Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 3, 7; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 5 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 8, 4, 3, etc. In some passages 6) Rv. i. 182, 7; x. 136, 6, and perhaps i. 145, 5; vii. 87, 6. Roth 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 1e. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, i. 99; 2, 122. sees the sense of ‘bird.’ See also Mr2ga Hastin, Purus2a Hastin.

मृग
2. Mr2ga in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 33, 5. denotes, according to Sa1yan2a's commentary, the constellation Mr2gas4iras. But it seems more probable 2) See Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xcii. that Mr2ga there really covers the whole of Orion, not merely the inconspicuous group of stars in the head of Orion that make up the Naks2atra Mr2gas4iras, but also the star a in his shoulder, which is reckoned as A1rdra1, and  in his left shoulder. Tilak, 3) Orion, 99 et seq. however, makes Mr2ga or Mr2gas4iras into a different group, consisting of the belt of Orion, with two stars in the knees and one in the left shoulder, which he deems to resemble a deer's head with an arrow through it, an implausible and unlikely theory. Cf. Mr2gavya1dha.

मृगहस्तिन्
3. Mr2ga Hastin, the ‘animal with a hand,’ is mentioned in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 64, 7; iv. 16, 14. in which Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Nirukta, Erla7uterungen, 79. recognizes that the elephant is meant, but concludes that the compound name is a proof of the newness of the elephant to the Vedic Indians. 3) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 99, 100, combats the view that the eler hant was new to the Vedic Indian, because of the similar use of mr2ga mahis2a and mr2ga su1kara (Av. xii. 1, 48) to denote the ‘buffalo’ and the ‘boar’ respectively. But Mahis2a seems rather to bear out Roth's conclusion; while Su1kara appears alone in the Rigveda, and mr2ga su1kara, ‘wild hog,’ seems to be used in one passage of the Av. (xii. 1, 48) to distinguish it from Vara1ha, ‘boar,’ in the same verse. Later the adjective Hastin alone became the regular name of the animal (like Mahis2a of the ‘buffalo’). The elephant is also denoted in the Rigveda by the descriptive term Mr2ga Va1ran2a, 4) Rv. viii. 33, 8; x. 40, 8. the ‘wild or dangerous animal,’ the adjective va1ran2a similarly becoming one of the names for ‘elephant’ in the later language. Pischel's view 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 121-123; 317319. Cf. Strabo, pp. 704, 705; Arrian, Indica, 13. 14 (from Megasthenes). that the catching of elephants by the use of tame female elephants is already alluded to in the Rigveda 6) viii. 2, 6; x. 40, 8. seems very doubtful. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 7) viii. 23, 3 (hiran2yena pari1vr2ta1n kr2s2n2a1n5 chukladato mr2ga1n). See Pischel, op. cit., 2, 122. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 80. elephants are described as ‘black, white-toothed, adorned with gold.’

मृगय
मृगय
 occurs in several passages of the Rigveda 1) iv. 16, 13; viii. 3, 19; x. 49, 5. as defeated by Indra. That he was a human foe, as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. thinks, seems unlikely: more probably he was a demon, as Mr2ga unquestionably is. 3) Rv. i. 80, 7; v. 29, 4, etc.

मृगयु
मृगयु,
 ‘hunter,’ occurs in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Av. x. 1, 26; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 27; xxx. 7, etc. Cf. mr2gan2yu, Rv. x. 40, 4. and the Bra1hman2as, 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 1, 1; iii. 4, 3, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 9, 12, etc. but not very often. The Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 3) xxx. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 4) iii. 4. however, in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) include a number of names which seem to be those of persons who make a livelihood by fishing or by hunting, such as the Ma1rga1ra, ‘hunter,’ the Kaivarta or Kevarta, Paun5jis2t2ha, Das4a, Maina1la, ‘fisher man,’ and perhaps the Bainda and the A1nda, 5) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 16; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 12, 1. who seem to have been some sort of fishermen. It is not probable that even in the earliest Vedic period hunting formed the main source of livelihood for any of the Vedic tribes: pastoral pursuits and agriculture (Kr2s2i) were, no doubt, the mainstay of their existence. But it would be unreasonable to suppose that not much hunting was done, both for recreation and for purposes of food, as well as for protection of flocks from wild beasts. The Rigveda is naturally our chief source of information in regard to hunting. The arrow was sometimes employed, 6) Rv. ii. 42, 2. but, as is usual with primitive man, the normal instruments of capture were nets and pitfalls. Birds were regularly caught in nets (Pa1s4a, 7) Pa1s4in, ‘hunter,’ Rv. iii. 45, 1. Nidha1, 8) Rv. ix. 83, 4; x. 73, 11. Ja1la), 9) Av. x. 1, 30. The bird-catcher being called nidha1-pati, 10) Rv. ix. 83, 4. ‘master of snares.’ The net was fastened on pegs 11) Av. viii. 8, 5. (as is done with modern nets for catching birds). Another name of net is apparently Muks2i1ja1. Pits were used for catching antelopes (R2s4ya), and so were called r2s4ya-da, 12) Rv. x. 39, 8. ‘antelope-catching.’ Elephants were captured as in Greek times, perhaps through the instrumentality of tame females (see Mr2ga Hastin). Apparently the boar was captured in the chase, dogs being used, 13) Rv. x. 86, 4. but the passage from which this view is deduced is of uncertain mythological content. There is also an obscure reference 14) Rv. x. 51, 6. to the capture of the buffalo (Gaura), but it is not clear whether the reference is to shooting with an arrow or capturing by means of ropes, perhaps a lasso, or a net. The lion was captured in pitfalls, 15) Rv. x. 28, 10. or was surrounded by the hunters and slain; 16) Rv. v. 15, 3. one very obscure passage refers to the lion being caught by ambuscade, which perhaps merely alludes to the use of the hidden pit. 17) Rv. v. 74, 4. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 542, n. The modes of catching fish are little known, for the only evidence available are the explanations of the various names mentioned in the Yajurveda. Sa1yan2a 18) On Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 12, 1. Cf. Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 18, 281. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 243245. says that Dhaivara is one who takes fish by netting a tank on either side; Da1s4a and S4aus2kala do so by means of a fish-hook (bad2is4a); Bainda, Kaivarta, and Maina1la by means of a net (ja1la); Ma1rga1ra catches fish in the water with his hands; A1nda by putting in pegs at a ford (apparently by building a sort of dam); Parn2aka by putting a poisoned leaf on the water. But none of these explanations can claim much authority.

मृगव्याध
मृग-व्याध,
 ‘the hunter,’ is the name of Sirius in the legned of Praja1pati's daughter in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) iii. 33, 5. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 205, n. 1, 208, n. 3; Tilak, Orion, 98 et seq.; Su1rya Siddha1nta, viii. 10; ix. 12, preserves the name. Praja1pati (Orion) pursues his daughter (Rohin2i1), and is shot by the archer Sirius. The transference of the legend of Praja1pati to the sky is no doubt secondary, caused by the obvious similarity of the constellation in question to the idea of an archer.

मृगाखर

 in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 (vii. 5, 21, 1) and Bra1hman2a (iii. 9, 17, 3) denotes the ‘lair of wild beasts.’

मृड
मृड
 is found only in compounds in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 1) Upaca1ya-mr2d2am2 hiran2yam, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 1; as2t2a1-mr2d2am2 hiran2yam, ibid., xiii. 10; as2t2a1-prud2-d2hiran2yam, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 1, 4, etc. where it seems to denote a small weight of gold. It is uncertain whether the reading should not be Pr2da, as in the grammatical tradition. 2) See Pa1n2ini, iii. 1, 123, with the Va1rttika; von Schroeder, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 164.

मृत्तिका
मृत्तिका,
 ‘clay,’ is mentioned in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 13; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 34, 2; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 4; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, x. 1, 8. 9. Cf. Mr2d. 

मृत्यु
मृत्यु,
 ‘death,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vii. 59, 12; x. 13, 4; 18, 1, 2; x. 48, 5; 60, 5. So mr2tyu-bandhu, ‘akin to death,’ Rv. viii. 18, 22; x. 95, 18. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 9, 4, where the world is said to be ‘yoked with death’ (mr2tyu-sam2yuta); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 9, 6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 2; 14, 1. 2. 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 5, 1, etc. So often the ‘bonds of death’ (mr2tyu-pa1s4a), Av. viii. 2, 2; 8, 10. 16; xvii. 1, 30; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 8, 2; Ka1t2haka Upanis2ad, i. 18, etc. as a thing of terror. There are a hundred and one forms of death, the natural one by old age 3) Av. ii. 13, 2; 28, 2. (jara1), and a hundred others, all to be avoided. 4) Av. i. 30, 3; ii. 28, 1; iii. 11, 5; viii. 2, 27; xi. 6, 16, etc. To die before old age (pura1 jarasah2) 5) Rv. viii. 67, 20; Av. v. 30, 17; x. 2, 30; xiii. 3, 56. is to die before the allotted span (pura1 a1yus2ah2), 6) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 4, 1. the normal length of life being throughout Vedic literature spoken of as a hundred years. 7) Rv. i. 64, 14; 89, 9; ii. 33, 2, etc. Cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 384; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 193; Festgruss an Reth, 137. On the other hand, the evils of old age in the loss of physical strength were clearly realized. 8) Rv. i. 71, 10; 179, 1. one of the feats of the As4vins was to restore old Cyava1na to his former youth and powers, and another was the rejuventation of Kali. 9) x. 39, 8. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 243. The Atharvaveda 10) See Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 62 et seq. is full of charms of all sorts to avert death and secure length of years (a1yus2ya). The modes of disposing of the dead were burial and cremation (see Agnidagdha). Both existed in the early Vedic period, 11) See Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, clii; Winternitz, Geschichte der indischen Literatur, 1, 84, 85. as in Greece; 12) See Lang, Homer and his Age, 82 et seq.; cf. Burrows, Discoveries in Crete, 209-213. but the former method was on the whole less favoured, and tended to be regarded with disapproval. The bones of the dead, whether burned or not, were marked by the erection of a tumulus (S4mas4a1na): the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 13) xiii. 8, 2, 1. preserves traces of strong differences of opinion as to the mode in which these tumuli should be constructed. There is little or no trace 14) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 410; Weinhold, Altnordisches Leben, 483 et seq. of the custom common in northern lands of sending the dead man to sea in a burning ship: the reference to a ship 15) Rv. x. 63, 10; 135, 4; Av. vii. 6, 3, and cf. Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 856. seems to point to mythical perils after death, not to the mode of burial. The life after death was to the Vedic Indian a repetition of the life in this world. He passed into the next world sarvatanuh2 sa1n3gah2, ‘with whole body and all his members,’ 16) Av. v. 6, 11; xviii. 4, 64; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 6, 1, 1; xi. 1, 8, 6; xii. 8, 3, 31, and cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 3, 5, 2; 6, 3; 6, 6, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 20, 5; 10, 11, 1. enjoying there the same pleasures as he had enjoyed on earth. Even in the Rigveda 17) Rv. ii. 29, 6; iii. 26, 8; iv. 5, 5; 25, 6; vii. 104, 3. 11. 17; x. 152, 4. there are hints of evil awaiting evil-doers, but it is not until the Atharvaveda 18) ii. 14, 3; v. 19, 3; 30, 11; viii. 2, 24; xii. 4, 36; xviii. 3, 3. Cf. also v. 19; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5. and the Bra1hman2as 19) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 1, 1 et seq.; Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 9, 240 et seq.; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 42-44 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 236 et seq.). that a hell of punishment is set out, and it is in the Bra1hman2as 20) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 2, 27; x. 6, 3, 1; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xii. 3, etc. that good and evil deeds are said to produce happiness or hell hereafter. But there is no hint of extinction 21) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 169. in the Rigveda as the fate of the wicked, as Roth 22) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 3, 329-347; Weber, op. cit., 238 et seq. inclined to think. The Vedic poet not being deeply moral, his verses do not convey, as would those of a man convinced of sin, warnings of future judgment.

मृद्

 denotes ‘clay’ in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 7, 9, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xi. 55. and the Bra1hman2as 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 1, 13; 2, 34; 3, 3; 3, 1, 22, 32; 3, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Upanis2ad vi. 27, etc. (cf. Mr2ttika1). A ‘lump of clay’ also occurs in the Bra1hman2as, 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 4, 2, 1; 5, 2, 1; xiv. 2, 1, 8; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 4. and a Mr2t-paca, ‘potter,’ in the Maitra1yan2i1 Upanis2ad. 4) ii. 6; iii. 3.

मेखला
 denotes ‘girdle’ in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Av. vi. 133, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 3, 3, 5; vi. 2, 2, 7; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 4; xxiv. 9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 6, 7, etc. and the Bra1hman2as. 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 1, 10; iv. 4, 5, 2; vi. 2, 2, 39, etc. The Brahmaca1rin wore a girdle. 3) In the Gr2hya Su1tras the girdle of the Brahmin is of Mun5ja, that of the Ks2atriya of a bowstring, and that of the Vais4ya of wool or hemp. See A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 19, 12, etc.

मेघ
मेघ
 denotes ‘cloud’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 181, 8. and later. 2) Av. iv. 15, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 2, 5; xii. 3, 2, 6; maha1-megha, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 4; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, vii. 3; viii. 7. The verb meghay, ‘to make cloudy weather,’ is found in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 5, 1, and meghayanti1 is the name of one of the seven Kr2ttika1s, Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 4, 1; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 301, 368.

मेथि
मेथि
 is found in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 5, 20. denoting ‘post.’ The word is also found in the marriage ritual, 2) Av. xiv. 1, 40. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 9, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 8; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 29, 22; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 3, 21. when the sense is, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a post to support the pole of a chariot. In one passage of the Rigveda it is perhaps used of posts forming a palisade. 3) viii. 53, 5 (mita-methi1bhih2 for medha1bhih2, conjectured by Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesell schaft, 48, 109). In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 4) xiii. 9, 17. Cf. Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 19, 1 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 329). it appears in the form of Methi1 to denote the post to which the sacrificial cow is tied. The word is very variously spelt, Medhi and Met2hi1 also being found.

मेध
मेध
 is a word of uncertain sense occurring in a Va1lakhilya hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 50, 10 (cf. viii. 49, 10), where, as a rule, the sense of ‘sacrifice’ is accepted as adequate. According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the proper name of a sacrificer may be meant.

मेधातिथि
मेधातिथि,
 1) This is the form of the later texts and of Rv. viii. 8, 20, where he occurs with Kan2va. Medhya1tithi 2) This is the usual form in the Rv.: i. 36, 10. 11. 17; viii. 1, 30; 2, 40; 33, 4; 49, 9; 51, 1; ix. 43, 3. (‘having a guest at the sacrifice’) appear to be the names of one and the same man, a descendant of Kan2va and a famous Vedic R2s2i, to whom the authorship of various hymns 3) i. 12-23; viii. 1-3; 22. 23; ix. 4143. In the ascriptions Medha1tithi and Medhya1tithi are confused. is attributed in the Anukraman2i1 (Index). To him Indra is said in the Rigveda 4) viii. 2, 40. Cf. i. 51, 1, where, however, there is no mention of Medha1ithi. to have come in the form of a ram: this myth is perpetuated in the Subrahman2ya1 formula 5) Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 79; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, i. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 18; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 12, 3. Moreover, the legend is alluded to in the S4a1t2ya1yanaka. See Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 51, 1; viii. 2, 40, and Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxl. On the explanation of the legend, cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 38 et seq. recited by the priest while the Soma is being carried within the sacrificial enclosure, when Indra is hailed as ‘ram of Medha1tithi.’ He appears also as a rival of Vatsa, whom he accused of low birth, but who convinced him of his error by undergoing a fire ordeal (cf. Divya). 6) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 6, 6. In the Atharvaveda 7) iv. 29, 6. he is mentioned with many other sages, and occurs elsewhere 8) As a Gr2hapati at the sacrifice of the Vibhinduki1yas, Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 233 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 38); Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xv. 10, 1; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxviii. 2.

मेध्य
मेध्य
 is the name of a man, an ancient sacrificer, in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 52, 2. In the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xvi. 11, 26. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 39; Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. he is erroneously transmuted into Pr2s2adhra Medhya Ma1taris4van, the patron of Praskan2va Ka1n2va.

Cf. Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxl. and in the Bra1hman2as 4) S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, i. 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 18; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 12, 3; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra. i. 3, 17.

A wild (a1ran2ya) ram is mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. 5) xxiv. 30. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 66, 67.

मेहत्नू
मेहत्नू
 is the name of a stream in the Nadi1stuti (‘Praise of Rivers’) in the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 344. It must apparently have been a tributary of the Sindhu (Indus), entering that river before the Krumu (Kurum) and Gomati1 (Gomal). It may conceivably have been a tributary of the Krumu.

मैत्रायणीयब्राह्मण
मैत्रायणीय ब्राह्मण
 is the name of a text mentioned in the S4ulba Su1tra of Baudha1yana. 1) Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxxii. 8. Cf. Caland, U7ber das rituclle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 41, who cannot trace the citation in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1.

It seems clearly to mean ‘fisherman’ from Mi1na, ‘fish,’ as Sa1yan2a 2) On Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. and Mahi1dhara 3) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. explain it.

 See Mu1javant.

मौद्गल्य
मौद्गल्य,
 ‘descendant of Mudgala,’ is the patronymic of several persons, Na1ka, 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 5, 2, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 4; Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, i. 9, 1. S4atabala1ks2a, 2) Nirukta, xi. 6. and La1n3gala1yana. 3) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 8. A Brahmaca1rin of the name is mentioned in the Gopatha Bra1hman2a 4) i. 1, 31; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 110. Cf. also Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 35. as disputing with Gla1va Maitreya.

मौन
मौन,
 ‘descendant of Muni,’ is the patronymic of An2i1cin in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a (xxiii. 5).

मौषिकीपुत्र
मौषिकी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Mu1s2ika1,’ is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Ha1rikarn2i1putra in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Ma1dhyam2dina recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 4, 30).

म्लेच्छ
म्लेच्छ
 occurs in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 2, 1, 24. in the sense of a barbarian in speech. The Brahmin is there forbidden to use barbarian speech. The example 2) iii. 2, 1, 23. given of such speech is lie 'lavo, explained by Sa1yan2a as he 'rayah2, ‘ho, foes.’ If this is correct--the Ka1n2va recension has a different reading 3) See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 31, n. 3. --the barbarians referred to were A1ryan speakers, though not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Pra1kr2ta form of speech. 4) Weber, Indian Literature, 180; cf. Keith, Aitareya A1ranyaka, 179, 180, 196. Cf. Va1c. Y.

यक्ष
यक्ष
 is found several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 190, 4; iv. 3, 13, v. 70, 4; vii. 56, 16; 61, 5; x. 88, 13. and the Atharvaveda 2) viii. 9, 25; x. 2, 32; 7, 38; 8, 43; xi. 2, 24, etc. in passages in which Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 262. sees the meaning of a feast or holy practice in accordance with the native commentators. It is, however, very doubtful whether this sense ever occurs. 4) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Geldner's full discussion, Vedische Studien, 3, 126-143.

यक्षु
यक्षु
 is mentioned, once in the singular and once in the plural, in the hymn of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 6. 19. which celebrates Suda1s battle with the ten kings. Who they were and what part they played in that conflict is quite uncertain. They seem, from the wording of the text, to have taken part in two conflicts, as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 126, 127. says--one on the Parus2n2i1 (Ravi), and one on the Yamuna1 (Jumna)--with the aid of the Ajas and S4igrus, under the leadership of Bh2eda. It is, however, at least possible that in the former passage Yadu should be read for Yaks2u, or, at any rate, Yaks2u be deemed a contemptuous substitute of the name of a possibly un-A1ryan or unimportant tribe (as their allies, the Ajas and S4igrus, clearly were) for the name of the certainly famous Yadus, as is suggested by Hopkins. 3) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 259 et seq. It is not clear however, whether Hopkins thinks that the Yadus are alluded to, but it seems probable. Cf. Turvas4a.

यक्ष्म
यक्ष्म
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 122, 9; x. 85, 31; 97, 11. 12; 137, 4; 163, 1-6. and the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 10, 5. 6; iii. 31, 1; v. 4, 9; 30, 6; viii. 7, 2; ix. 8, 3. 7. 10; xii. 2, 1. 2; 4, 8; xix. 36, 1; 38, 1. frequently denotes ‘illness,’ in general, perhaps as rendering the body emaciated. A hundred kinds of Yaks2ma are referred to in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 3) xii. 97. and a-yaks2ma in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 4) xvii. 11. denotes ‘free from disease.’ In the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 5, 2; 5, 6, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 3, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 375 et seq.; Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 400; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 60; Jolly, Medicin, 89. an account is given of the origin of Yaks2ma, which is distinguished as of three kinds--Ra1ja-yaks2ma, ‘royal Yaks2ma,’ Pa1pa-yaks2ma, ‘evil Yaks2ma,’ and Ja1yenya, most probably ‘syphilis.’ The second of the series is elsewhere unknown, and can hardly be defined, for it merely means ‘serious or deadly disease.’ Cf. also Ajn5a1tayaks2ma.

यजत
यजत
 occurs in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) v. 44, 10, 11. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. where he is apparently a R2s2i or a sacrificer.

यजुर्वेद
यजुर्-वेद,
 the ‘Veda of the sacrificial utterance’ (Yajus), is mentioned frequently in the Bra1hman2as 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 12, 9, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 32, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 8, 3; xii. 3, 4, 9. and Upanis2ads. 2) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 3, 5; Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 3, 8; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 5, 5; ii. 4. 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11; Cha1ndogya Upar s2ad, i. 3, 7; iii. 2, 1. 2; 15, 7; vii. 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1; A1s4vala1yana Sra Su1tra, x. 7, 2; Sa1n3kha1yana Sra Su1tra, xvi. 2, 6, etc.

यजुस्
यजुस्
 is repeatedly distinguished from the R2c and the Sa1man in Vedic literature. 1) Rv. x. 90, 9; Av. v. 26, 1; ix. 6, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 3, 1; 9, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 30; iv. 1; xix. 28; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 29, 21; viii. 13, 2; S4atapatha Brahman2a, i. 2, 1, 7; vi. 5, 1, 2; 3, 4, etc. In the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 33, there is a reference to the s4ukla1ni Yaju1m2s2i, ‘white or pure Yajus,’ as promulgated by Va1jasaneya Ya1jn5avalkya, whence the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hi1ta1 is popularly known as the ‘White Yajurveda.’ The theory that this is due to the fact that in the Va1jasaneyi the Mantra parts of the text are not accompanied by Bra1hman2a passages is, though accepted by Weber, Indian Literature, 103, 104; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxvii, and others, now to be abandoned. In the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, v. 10, the expression s4ukrayaja1m2s2i seems to refer to books iv. and v. of that text. Cf. also Winternitz. Geschichte der indischen Literatur, 1, 149, n. The Yajus is the utterance accompanying the sacrifice, and may have the form of verse or prose, the tern covering both. 

यज्ञगाथा
यज्ञ-गाथा
 denotes a verse (Ga1tha1) containing a maxim as to the sacrifice of any kind or sort, 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 43, 5; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 12, 6; S4a1nkha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 8, 26; 9, 6, etc. or, as it is expressed in the Maha1bha1rata, 2) xii. 791. 2316. a ‘verse sung regarding the sacrifice’ (ga1tha1 yajn5a-gi1ta1).

यज्ञवचस्राजस्तम्बायन
यज्ञ-वचस् राजस्तम्बायन,
 ‘descendant of Ra1jastamba,’ is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Tura Ka1vas2eya, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) x. 4, 2, 1; 6, 5, 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 5, 4 Ka1n2va. He is also mentioned in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1. 2) iii. 10, 3; iv. 8, 2.

यज्ञसेन
यज्ञ-सेन
 is the name of a teacher with the patronymic Caitra or Caitriya1yan2a mentioned in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 3, 8, 1 (Caitriya1yan2a); Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxi. 4 (Caitra).

यज्ञेषु
यज्ञेषु
 is the name of a man in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 1) i. 5, 2, 1. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 306. He was made to prosper by his priest Ma1tsya, who knew the exact moment of sacrificing.

यज्ञोपवीत
यज्ञोपवीत
 denotes the ‘wearing of the Brahminical thread over the left shoulder at the sacrifice,’ and is mentioned as early as the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 1) iii. 10, 9, 12. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 11, 1; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 2, 1; 6, 1, 12; and Pra1ci1na1vi1ta. Tilak, 2) Orion, 145 et seq., quoting Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 1, and, the view of the Mi1ma1msists, Jaimini1yanya1yama1la1vistara, iii. 4, 1. This view is not prejudiced by the quite implausible conjectures as to Orion's belt with which it is combined. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books o the East, 12, 361, 424. however, urges that it was not originally a thread that was worn, but a garment of cloth (Va1sas) or of deerskin (Ajina). This seems quite probable. 

यति
यति
 is the name of an ancient clan which is connected with the Bhr2gus in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 3, 9; 6, 18; Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 465, n. where the Yatis certainly seem to be real persons. In another hymn, 2) x. 72, 7. however, they already appear as almost mythical. In the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 9, 2; vi. 2, 7, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 5; xi. 10; xxv. 6; xxxvi. 7; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, viii. 1, 4; xiii. 4, 16; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 28, 1; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 3, etc.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 437 et seq. and elsewhere, 4) ii. 304. In the parallel passage, Av. ii. 5, 3, the reading Yati1r is found, possibly an error for Yati1n, or merely a blunder. Cf. Muir, op. cit., 5, 49, n. 92; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 44; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vi. 3, 1. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 146. the Yatis are a race whom Indra, in an evil moment, gave over to the hyænas (Sa1la1vr2ka): exactly what is referred to is uncertain. Yati is mentioned with Bhr2gu in a verse of the Sa1maveda. 4) ii. 304. In the parallel passage, Av. ii. 5, 3, the reading Yati1r is found, possibly an error for Yati1n, or merely a blunder. Cf. Muir, op. cit., 5, 49, n. 92; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 44; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vi. 3, 1. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 146.

यदु
यदु
 is the name of a tribe and of the king of the tribe. They are mentioned repeatedly in the Rigveda, 1) i. 36, 18; 54, 6; 174, 9; iv. 30, 17; v. 31, 8; vi. 45, 1; viii. 4, 7; 7, 18; 9, 14; 10, 5; 45, 27; ix. 61, 2; x. 49, 8; plural, i. 108, 8. See Turvas4a, and Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 258 et seq. normally in conjunction with Turvas4a. They seem to have taken part in the great battle against Suda1s: 2) Whether Yadu should be read in Rv. vii. 18, 6, or not, the Yadus seem to be meant. Cf. Yaks2u. the Yadu and the Turvas4a kings seem to have escaped with their lives, while the Anu and the Druhyu kings perished. This is at least the most natural explanation of several passages, 3) Rv. i. 174, 9; iv. 30, 17; v. 31, 3; vi. 20, 12. though these passages possibly refer to a successful raid across the Sarayu, and a defeat of two princes, Arn2a and Citraratha. 4) Rv. iv. 30, 18. That Turvas4a was the Yadu king, as Hopkins 5) Loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 122, 124; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 205; 5, 142; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 37. holds, is most improbable.

यन्तृ
यन्तृ
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 19; x. 22, 5. and in the Su1tras 2) Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 6, 29, etc. denotes a ‘driver’ of horses or ‘charioteer.’ 

यम
यम
 denotes ‘twins,’ the birth of which is frequently alluded to in Vedic literature. 1) Rv. i. 66, 4; 164, 15; ii. 39, 2; iii. 39, 3; v. 57, 4; vi. 59, 2; x. 13, 2; 117, 9; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 4, 10, etc. Twins of different sex seem to be indicated by the expression yamau mithunau. 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 4; Nirukta, xii. 10. There are traces of the belief--widely spread among negro and other races--that twins are uncanny and of evil omen, 3) Av. iii. 28; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 9, 8; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxv. 4, 35; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 4, 14, etc. Cf. Yamasu1; Yukta1s4va. but there are also vestiges of the opposite opinion, that twins are lucky. 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 1, 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 12, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 8, and cf. Rv. iii. 39, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 298300; Naxatra, 2, 314, n.

यमसू
यम-सू,
 a ‘bearer of twins,’ is one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 15; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 11, 1.

यमुना
यमुना,
 ‘twin,’ the name of a river, so called as running parallel with the Ganges, is mentioned thrice in the Rigveda, 1) v. 52, 17; vii. 18, 19; x. 75, 5. and not rarely later. According to the Rigveda, 2) vii. 18, 19. See Bharata and Kuru. the Tr2tsus and Suda1s won a great victory against their foes on the Yamuna1; there is no reason 3) The Tr2tsus’ territory lay between the Yamuna1 and the Sarasvati1 on the east and the west respectively. whatever to accept Hopkins' 4) India, Old and New, 52. view that the Yamuna1 here was another name of the Parus2n2i1 (Ravi). In the Atharvaveda 5) iv. 9, 10. the salve (A1n5jana) of the Yamuna1 (Ya1muna) is mentioned along with that of Trikakud (Traikakuda) as of value. In the Aitareya 6) viii. 23. and the S4atapatha 7) xiii. 5, 4, 11. Bra1hman2as the Bharatas are famed as victorious on the Yamuna1. Other Bra1hman2as 8) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 4, 11 (cf. Pa1ra1vata); xxv. 10, 24; 13, 4; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xiii. 29, 25. 33; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxiv. 6, 10. 39; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 19, 9, 10; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 6, 28, etc. also mention this river. In the Mantrapa1t2ha 9) ii. 11, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 5; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 323. the Sa1lvas are spoken of as dwelling on its banks.

ययाति
ययाति
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda, 1) i. 31, 17; x. 63, 1. once as an ancient sacrificer, and once as Nahus2ya, ‘descendant of Nahus2a,’ apparently a king. There is no trace whatever of his connexion with Pu1ru, as in the Epic, 2) Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147; Muir, Sanskrit Texts 12, 232. the tradition of which must be deemed to be inaccurate.

यव
1. Yava in the Rigveda 1) i. 23, 15; 66, 3; 117, 21; 135, 8; 176, 2; ii. 5, 6; 14, 11; v. 85, 3; vii. 3, 4; viii. 2, 3; 22, 6; 63. 9; 78, 10, etc. appears to be a generic term for any sort of ‘grain,’ and not merely ‘barley.’ The latter sense is probably found in the Atharvaveda, 2) ii. 8, 3; vi. 30, 1; 50. 1. 2; 91, 1; 141, 2; 142, 1. 2; viii. 7, 20; ix. 1, 22; 6, 14; xii. 1, 42; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 10, 3; 4, 10, 5; vii. 2, 10, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 10; xxvi. 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, v. 26; xviii. 12; xxiii. 30; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 4, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 20: ii. 5, 2, 1; iii. 6, 1, 9. 10; iv. 2, 1, 11; xii. 7, 2, 9; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 14, 3, etc.; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iv. 12. and is regular later. The barley harvest came after spring, 3) Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iv. 13. in the summer. 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 2, 10, 2. That barley was cultivated in the period of the Rigveda 5) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86, n. is not certain, but on the whole very probable. 6) Sowing (vap) grain is referred to in Rv. i. 117, 21; ripening of grain in 135, 8; ploughing (kr2s2) in i. 176, 2. Grain rejoicing in rain is alluded to in ii. 5, 6. See Kr2s2i. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 282; Kuhn, Indische Studien, 1, 355, 356; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238, 239.

 in the Rigveda 1) i. 38, 5; 91, 13; iii. 45, 3; iv. 41, 10; 42, 5; vii. 18, 10; 87, 2; 93, 2; 102, 1, etc. and later 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 43, etc. denotes the ‘grass’ on which animals feed, and which is burned by the forest fire. 3) Cf. Agni, yavasa1d, in Rv. i. 94, 11. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 47; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 87. 

यवागू
यवागू
 means ‘barley-gruel,’ 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 5, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 2; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 8, 8; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iv. 13, etc. but is also used of weak decoctions of other kinds of grain. 2) Of Jartila and Gvi1dhuka, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 4, 3, 2.

यवाशिर्
यवाशिर्
 is used in the Rigveda 1) i. 187, 9; ii. 22, 1; iii. 42, 7; viii. 94, 4. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 227; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 279. as an epithet of Soma, meaning ‘mixed with grain.’

यवाष
यवाष
 See Yeva1s2a.

यव्य
यव्य
 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (i. 7, 2, 46) denotes ‘month’ (lit., ‘containing a first half,’ see 2. Yava).

यव्यावती
यव्यावती
 is the name of a river in the Rigveda 1) vi. 27, 6. and in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 2) xxv. 7, 2. Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 268, n. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 18, 19; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204; Kaegi, Rigveda, n. 338; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 168, n. 1. thinks that the river is one in Iran, the Djob (Zhobe), near the Irya1b (Halia1b), but there is no reason to accept this identification.

यशस्विन्जयन्तलौहित्य
यशस्विन् जयन्त लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Kr2s2n2ara1ta Triveda Lauhitya in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 42, 1).

यष्टि
यष्टि,
 ‘staff,’ is mentioned in the latest parts of the Bra1hman2as. 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 2, 17 of ven2u, ‘bamboo’); Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 7; Kaus2ita1ki Upanis2ap iv. 19. etc. 

यस्क
यस्क
 is the name of a man. The Yaskas, descendants of Giriks2it (Gairiks2ita1h2) are mentioned in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 1) xiii. 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 475 et seq.; 8, 245 et seq.; Indian Literature, 41, n. 30. Cf. Ya1ska.

याज्ञतुर
याज्ञ-तुर,
 ‘descendant of Yajn5atura,’ is the patronymic of 2. R2s2abha in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) xii. 8, 3, 7; xiii. 5, 4, 15; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 9, 8, 10.

याज्ञवल्क्य
याज्ञ-वल्क्य,
 ‘descendant of Yajn5avalkya,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) i. 1, 1, 9; 3, 1, 21. 26; 9, 3, 16; ii. 3, 1, 21; 4, 3, 2; 5, 1, 2 (where he is said to be in contradiction with the Rigveda); iii. 1, 1, 4; 2, 21; 3, 10; 8, 2, 24 (cursed by a Caraka teacher); iv. 2, 1, 7; 6, 1, 10; 8, 7, etc. There are no references to Ya1jn5avalkya in books v-ix, which, on the contrary, owe their doctrine to Tura Ka1vas2eya and S4a1n2d2ilya; but the fame of Ya1jn5avalkya revives in books x-xiv--e.g., xi. 3, 1, 2; 4, 2, 17; 3, 20; 6, 2, 1; 3, 1; xii. 4, 1, 10, etc. as an authority on questions of ritual. He is, however, also given as an authority on questions of philosophy in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 2) iii. 1, 2 et seq.; 2, 10 et seq.; 3, 1; 4, 1; 5, 1; 6, 1; 7, 1, etc. but Oldenberg 3) Buddha,^5 34, n. 1. is, no doubt, right in thinking that no possible importance can be attached to the mention of Ya1jn5avalkya in the latter capacity. He is said to have been a pupil of Udda1laka A1run2i, 4) vi. 4, 33 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 5, 4 Ka1n2va). whom he opposed successfully in a dispute. 5) iii. 7, 1. His two wives, Maitreyi1 and Ka1tya1yani1, are mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 6) ii. 4, 1; iv. 5, 1 et seq. which concludes 7) vi. 4, 33 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 5, 4 Ka1n2va). with a passage ascribing to Ya1jn5avalkya Va1jasaneya the ‘white Yajus’ (s4ukla1ni yaju1m2s2i). It is remarkable that Ya1jn5avalkya is never mentioned in any other Vedic text outside the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a except the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 8) ix. 7; xiii. 1. where, however, both reference are merely transcripts from the S4atapatha. 9) Weber, Indian Literature, 132, n. *; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 374. It has been supposed by Oldenberg 10) Buddha,^5 34, n. 1. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 120 et seq.; Indische Studien, 1, 173; 13, 265269; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxx et seq.; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 188. and others that Ya1jn5avalkya belonged to Videha, but despite the legend of Janaka's patronage of him, his association with Udda1laka, the Kuru-Pan5ca1la, renders this doubtful.

The feminine, Ya1tudha1ni1, is also found in the Rigveda and later. 4) Rv. i. 191, 8; x. 118, 8; Av. i. 28, 24; ii. 14, 3; iv. 9, 9; 18, 17; xix. 37, 8, etc. Cf.

Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 142. is alluded to elsewhere. In another passage a beast (pas4u) of the Yadus or Ya1dvas is mentioned. 3) Rv. viii. 1, 31. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 3; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 37. Cf. Yadu. 

यान

 used in the plural, denotes in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 21, 2. according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1d. the planets among which the sun (bhaga) wanders. But both Bloomfield 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 30. and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 396. accept the sense--the regular one in the later language--of ‘night watches.’

Weber, Indian Literature, 128. as a contemporary of A1sura1yan2a and a teacher of Bha1radva1ja. Whether Ya1ska, author of the Nirukta, 2) R2gveda Pra1tis4a1khya, xvii. 25; Weber, op. cit., 25, 26, etc.; Indische Studien, 1, 17, 103; 3, 396; 8, 243, etc.; Indian Literature, 41, n. 30. was the same person, it is, of course, impossible to say.

यु
यु,
 appearing in the dual in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (iii. 7, 4, 10), seems to mean ‘yoke animals.’ 

युक्त
युक्त
 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (vi. 7, 4, 8; xii. 4, 1, 2) denotes a ‘yoke’ of oxen. Cf. 1. Yuga.

युक्ताश्व
युक्ताश्व
 is the name of a man who is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xi. 8, 8. as the seer of a Sa1man, or chant. He is said to have exposed a pair of twins, 2) Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 314, n., whose view is that of Sa1yan2a on the passage. Cf. Yama. but Hopkins 3) Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 61, 62. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie. 2, 160. thinks that the reference is only to an exchange of children.

युग
1. Yuga in the Rigveda 1) i. 115, 2; 184, 3; ii. 39, 4; iii. 53, 17; viii. 80, 7; x. 60, 8; 101, 3, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 1, 40; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 1, 24. 34; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 1, 3, etc. denotes ‘yoke.’ Cf. Ratha.

युग
2. Yuga in the Rigveda 1) Yuge-yuge, ‘in every age,’ i. 139, 8; iii. 26, 3; vi. 8, 5; 15, 8; 36, 5; ix. 94, 12; uttara1 yuga1ni, ‘future ages,’ iii. 33, 8; x. 10, 10; pu1rva1n2i yuga1ni, vii. 70, 4; uttare yuge, x. 72, 1, etc. In i. 92, 11; 103, 4; 115, 2; 124, 2; 144, 4, etc., the phrase ‘generations of men’ (mans2ya1, manus2ah2, jana1na1m) are referred to. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 45, 46. frequently denotes a ‘generation’; but the expression das4ame yuge applied to Di1rghatamas in one passage 2) i. 158, 6. Wilson, Translation, 2, 104, n., suggests that yuga here means a lustrum of five years; but the tenth decade is far more likely, as Di1rghatamas is said to be ‘aged’ (jujurva1n). must mean ‘tenth decade’ of life. There is no reference in the older Vedic texts to the five-year cycle (see Sam2vatsara). The quotation from the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 3) xvii. 13, 17. given in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, and by Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 368. and others, is merely a citation from a modern text in the commentary on that work. Nor do the older Vedic texts know of any series of Yugas or ages such as are usual later. In the Atharvaveda 5) viii. 2, 21. there are mentioned in order a hundred years, an ayuta (10,000?), and then two, three, or four Yugas: the inference from this seems to be that a Yuga means more than an ayuta, but is not very certain. Zimmer 6) Op. cit., 371. adduces a passage from the Rigveda, 7) viii. 101, 4 = Av. x. 8, 3. but the reference there, whatever it may be, 8) Cf. Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 1, 1, with Keith's note; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 253. is certainly not to the four ages (cf. also Triyuga). 9) In Rv. x. 72, 2, deva1na1m2 pu1rvye yuge, ‘in the earlier age of the gods,’ occurs. The Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 10) iii. 12, 9, 2. Cf. Muir, 12, 42, n. 66. recognizes long periods of time--e.g., one of 100,000 years. To the four ages, Kali, Dva1para, Treta1, and Kr2ta, there is no certain reference in Vedic literature, though the names occur as the designations of throws at dice (see Aks2a). In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 11) vii. 15, 4 (in the description of the merits of exertion): ‘A man while lying is the Kali; moving himself, he is the Dva1para; rising, he is the Treta1; walking, he becomes the Kr2ta’ (Kalih2 s4aya1no bhavati sam2jiha1nas tu Dva1parah2 | uttis2t2ham2s Treta1 bhavati, Kr2tam2 sam2padyate caran||). the names occur, but it is not clear that the ages are really meant. Haug 12) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 2, 464, criticized by Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 319. thought that the dice were meant: this view is at least as probable as the alternative explanation, which is accepted by Weber, 13) Indische Studien, 1, 286; 9, 315 et seq. Roth, 14) Indische Studien, 1, 460. Wilson, 15) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1851, 99. Max Mu7ller, 16) Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 412. and Muir. 17) Sanskrit Texts, 12, 48, n. 86. Roth, indeed, believes that the verse is an interpolation; but in any case it must be remembered that the passage is from a late book of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. Four ages--Pus2ya, Dva1para, Kha1rva1, and Kr2ta--are mentioned in the late S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 18) v. 6. and the Dva1para in the Gopatha Bra1hman2a. 19) i. 1, 28; Weber, Indian Literature, 151, n. 166; Windisch, Buddha und Ma1ra, 151. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 367371; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 91. A quite different theory of the Yugas is given by Shamasastry, Gava1m Ayana, 141 et seq., but his whole theory is quite impossible. Weber once (Indian Literature, 113, n. 127) found the mention of the quinquennial Yuga in Rv. iii. 55, 18, but that passage refers to the five or six seasons (see Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 382, n.), while i. 25, 8, merely alludes to the intercalary month. Weber also (op. cit., 70, 247) considers that the Yugas are derived from the phases of the moon, but this idea was long since disposed of by Roth, Die Lehre von den vier Weltaltern (Tu7bingen, 1860). 

युद्ध

 in the Rigveda 1) x. 54, 2. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 9, 1; Aitareva Bra1hman2a, iii. 39, 1. 2; vi. 36, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 1, 5, 6; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 1, etc. denotes ‘battle.’ The more usual word earlier 3) Rv. i. 53, 7; 59, 1; v. 25, 6; vi. 46, 11, etc.; Av. i. 24, 1; iv. 24, 7; vi. 66, 1; 103, 3, etc.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 4, 16, etc. is Yudh.

युधांश्रौष्टिऔग्रसैन्य
युधां-श्रौष्टि औग्र-सैन्य
 (‘descendant of Ugrasena’) is the name, in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) viii. 21, 7. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 8. The Paura1n2ic form is Yuddha-mus2t2i. of a king who was anointed by Parvata and Na1rada.

युध्यामधि
युध्यामधि
 is apparently the name of a king who was defeated by Suda1s. The mention of him occurring only in the verses added at the end of the hymn celebrating the victory of Suda1s over the ten kings 1) Rv. vii. 18, 24. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. can claim little authenticity as a notice of Suda1s.

युवति
युवति
 is the ordinary expression for a ‘young woman’ or ‘maiden’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 118, 5; ii. 35, 4; iii. 54, 14; iv. 18, 8; v. 2, 1. 2; ix. 86, 16; x. 30, 5. and later. 2) Av. xiv. 2, 61; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 1, 9; 2, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 1, 9, 6; 4, 3, 8, etc.

It also designates the post to which the door of the house was attached (Durya). 3) Rv. i. 51, 14. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153. 

यूषन्

 occurring in the description of the horse-sacrifice in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 13. and the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 3, 11, 1. 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxv. 9. denotes the ‘broth’ which was made from the flesh of the sacrificial animal, and was no doubt used as food. Vessels employed for holding it, Pa1tra and A1secana, are mentioned. Another form of the word, found in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 3) vi. 3, 11, 1. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271; Schrader, Prehisteric Antiquities, 316. is Yu1s, which corresponds to the Latin jus.

येवाष
येवाष
 is the name of a destructive insect in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 23, 7. 8. The form Yava1s2a is found in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 2) xxx. 1 (Indische Studien, 3, 462). The same form occurs in the Gan2as, kumuda1di and preks2a1di (Pa1n2ini, iv. 2, 80). Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 8, 1, where Yava1s2a should be read; Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1, xlvi. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Vr2s2a.

 occurs frequently in the Rigveda 1) i. 123, 8; ii. 16, 3; x. 78, 7; 86, 20, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 26, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 9; iii. 8, 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 2, 7, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 363, who finds in Rv. i. 123, 8, yojana as a division of time equivalent to the Muhu1rta. But this is most improbable. as a measure of distance, 3) That is, the distance driven in one ‘harnessing’ (without unyoking), a ‘stage.’ but there is no reference defining its real length. Later it is reckoned at four Kros4as, or about nine miles. 4) Sometimes calculated at 8 kros4as, or 18 miles. The estimate of 2(1/2) miles is also found.

योध
योध
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 143, 5; iii. 39, 4; vi. 25, 5; x. 78, 3. means ‘fighter,’ ‘warrior,’ ‘soldier.’

Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 418. So these terms are often opposed in the Bra1hman2as to Vr2s2an, ‘male,’ in the general sense of ‘female,’ 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 5, 15 (yos2a1), and often in the Bra1hman2as. but they also occur in the sense of ‘wife,’ 3) Av. xii. 3, 29 (yos2a1). or ‘daughter,’ 4) So yos2a1 in Rv. i. 117, 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 310. or merely ‘girl.’ 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 1, 7. See Stri1.

 occurs once in the plural in the Atharvaveda, 1) viii. 7, 24. where the Paippala1da recension reads vaghat2ah. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 1a. once con jectured raghavah2, ‘swift,’ as the correct reading. Bloomfield, 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 580. who in his translation explains the word as ‘falcons,’ in his notes inclines to think Roth's conjecture likely. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 504. suggests ‘bees’ as the meaning. Possibly some kind of bird may be intended. 5) Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 501.

It is said in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 2) xi. 1 (Indische Studien, 3, 474). that Kratujit Ja1naki successfully sacrificed for him when he desired to obtain eyesight. He is also mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 3) xiii. 4, 11. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 58, n. 2. where the name of his son, Ugradeva Ra1jani, also occurs. 4) He was a leper, and the Rajani1 is used against leprosy, Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 266.

रजनी

 is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 23, 1. Cf. Roth in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 24; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 267. where it denotes some sort of plant, probably so called because of its power of ‘colouring’ (from ran5j, ‘to colour’). The species cannot be identified owing to the untrustworthiness of the later authorities who attempt its identification.

रजयित्री
रजयित्री,
 a ‘female dyer,’ is included in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 12; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 7, 1.

2. Rajas in one passage of the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Rajah2-s4aya, Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, v. 8; raja1s4aya, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 2, 11, 2 (Sa1yan2a on Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 23, 2); Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 2, 7; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ii. 8. clearly means ‘silver,’ like Rajata. It is also taken in this sense in one passage of the Rigveda 2) x. 105, 7. by Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 55, 56. but this interpretation is doubtful.

रजस

 occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) x. 2, 25. apparently as the name of a kind of ‘fish.’ Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 621; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaved2a, 624. however, understood it as an adjective meaning ‘impure.’

 in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 8 (s4i1rs2an2ya1 ras4ana1 rajjuh2, referring to the horse presumably means the head harness). and later 2) Av. iii. 11, 8; vi. 121, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 1, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 1, 14; x. 2, 3, 8; xi. 3, 1, 1, etc. denotes ‘rope.’ In the Atharvaveda 3) iv. 3, 2; xix. 47, 7, 8; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 368. the serpent is called the ‘toothed rope’ (rajju datvati1).

रज्जुदाल

 is the name of a tree (Cordia myxa or latifolia) the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) xiii. 4, 4, 6. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 373, n. 2.

रज्जुसर्ज
रज्जु-सर्ज,
 ‘rope-maker,’ is one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 7; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 3, 1.

रत्नि
रत्नि,
 ‘ell,’ occurring in the S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a (iv. 4) is a corruption of Aratni.

रत्निन्
रत्निन्,
 ‘receiving gifts,’ is the term applied to those people of the royal entourage in whose houses the Ratna-havis, a special rite, was performed in the course of the Ra1jasu1ya or ‘royal consecration.’ The list given in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) i. 8, 9, 1 et seq. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 2) i. 7, 3, 1 et seq. consists of the Brahman (i.e., the Purohita), the Ra1janya, the Mahis2i1 (the first wife of the king), the Va1va1ta (the favourite wife of the king), the Parivr2kti1 (the discarded wife), the Sena1ni1, ‘commander of the army’; the Su1ta, ‘charioteer’; the Gra1man2i1, ‘village headman’; the Ks2attr2, ‘chamberlain’; the Sam2grahi1tr2, ‘charioteer’ or ‘treasurer’; the Bha1gadugha, ‘collector of taxes’ or ‘divider of food’; and the Aks2a1va1pa, ‘superintender of dicing’ or ‘thrower of dice.’ In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) v. 3, 1, 1 et seq. the order is Sena1ni1; Purohita; Mahisi1; Su1ta; Gra1man2i1; Ks2attr2; Sam2grahitr2; Bha1gadugha; Aks2a1va1pa; Go-nikartana, ‘slayer of cows’ or ‘huntsman’; and Pa1la1gala, ‘courier’; the ‘discarded wife’ being mentioned as forbidden to stay at home 4) According to Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 3, 35, she goes to a Brahmin's house, where she shares his inviolability and exemption from jurisdiction. on the day of the ceremony of offering a pap for Nirr2ti in her house. In the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 5) ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8. the list is Brahman (i.e., Purohita); Ra1jan; Mahis2i1; Parivr2kti1; Sena1ni1; Sam2grahi1tr2; Ks2attr2; Su1ta; Vais4yagra1man2i1; Bha1gadugha; Taks2a-Rathaka1rau, ‘carpenter and chariot-maker’; Aks2a1va1pa; and Go-vikarta. The Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 6) xv. 4. substitutes Go-vyacha for Govikarta, and omits Taks2a-Rathaka1rau. It will be seen that the list is essentially that of the royal household, and of the king's servants in the administration of the country, though the exact sense of Sam2grahi1tr2, Bha1gadugha, Su1ta, Gra1man2i1, Ks2attr2, is open to reasonable doubt, mainly as to whether public officers or private servants 7) Similarly Aks2a1va1pa is either the man who dices for the king--i.e., a professional dicer who plays with the king or watches his play--or a public officer who superintends the gambling halls of the state and collects the revenue, as was regularly done later on. Early English history shows similar evolution of household officers into ministers of state. are meant, for the names are of uncertain significance. A briefer list of eight Vi1ras, ‘heroes,’ as among the friends of the king, is given in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a: 8) xix. 1, 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 200; U7ber den Ra1jasu1ya, 4; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 128; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 58-65; Hopkins, Tran5sactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30, n. 2. brother, son, Purohita, Mahis2i1, Su1ta, Gra1man2i1, Ks2attr2, and Sam2grahi1tr2.

 in the Rigveda 1) i. 20, 3; iii. 15, 5; iv. 4, 10; 16, 20; 36, 2; 43, 25, etc. and later 2) Av. v. 14, 5; x. 1, 8: Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 12, 3, etc. denotes ‘chariot’ as opposed to Anas, ‘cart,’ though the distinction is not absolute. Of differences in the structure of the two we have no information, except that the Kha, or nave hole, in the wheel of the chariot was greater than in that of the cart. 3) viii. 91, 7, with Sa1yan2a's note; Vedische Studien, 2, 333. The chariot has, as a rule, two wheels (Cakra), to which reference is frequently made. 4) Cf. Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 16, 5; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 16, 7; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 4. The wheel consisted of a rim (Pavi), a felly (Pradhi), spokes (Ara), 5) Cf. Rv. i. 32, 15; 141, 9; v. 13, 6; 58, 5; viii. 20, 14; 77, 3; x. 78, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 4, etc. and a nave (Nabhya). The rim and the felly together constitute the Nemi. The hole in the nave is called Kha: into it the end of the axle was inserted; but there is some uncertainty whether A1n2i denotes the extremity of the axle that was inserted in the nave, or the lynch-pin used to keep that extremity in the wheel. Sometimes a solid wheel was used. 6) Cf. Pradhi1. The axle (Aks2a) was, in some cases, made of Arat2u wood; 7) Rv. viii. 46, 27; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 247, n. round its ends the wheels revolved. To the axle was attached the body of the chariot (Kos4a). This part is also denoted by the word Vandhura, which more precisely means the ‘seat’ of the chariot. The epithet tri-vandhura is used of the chariot of the As4vins, seemingly to correspond with another of its epithets, tri-cakra: perhaps, as Weber 8) Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 564; Virchow, Zeitschrift fu7r Ethnologie 5, 200. Cf. note 21. thinks, a chariot with three seats and three wheels was a real form of vehicle; but Zimmer 9) Op. cit. iii. considers that the vehicle was purely mythical. Garta also denotes the seat of the warrior. At right angles to the axle was the pole of the chariot (I1s2a1, Prau7ga). Normally there was, it seems, one pole, on either side of which the horses were harnessed, a yoke (Yuga) being laid across their necks; the pole was passed through the hole in the yoke (called Kha 10) This seems to be the sense of Rv. viii. 91, 7; but it has also been taken as the opening in the yoke through which the ox's head passed (the Homeric ). See Cowell's note on Wilson's translation; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 237, n. or Tardman), 11) Av. xiv. 1, 40. the yoke and the pole then being tied together. 12) Rv. iii. 6, 6; v. 56, 4; x. 60, 8. The horses were tied by the neck (gri1va1), where the yoke was placed, and also at the shoulder, presumably by traces fastened to a bar of wood at right angles to the pole, or fastened to the ends of the pole, if that is to be regarded, as it probably should, as of triangular shape, wide at the foot and coming to a point at the tip. 13) Zimmer, op. cit., 249, thinks that va1n2i1 in Rv. i. 119, 5, denotes the two bars of wood to which the traces were fastened. This is also the view of Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., Bo7htlingk's Lexicon, and Grassmann. The word may mean ‘two voices’ (Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 162). The traces seem to be denoted by Ras4mi and Ras4ana1. These words also denote the ‘reins,’ which were fastened to the bit (perhaps s4ipra1) in the horse's mouth. The driver controlled the horses by reins, and urged them on with a whip (Kas4a1). 14) Rv. v. 83, 3; vi. 75, 6. The girths of the horse were called Kaks2ya1. 15) Rv. x. 10, 13; kaks2ya-pra1, ‘filling out the girths’ (i.e., ‘well fed’), is an epithet of Indra's horses, i. 10, 3. The normal number of horses seems to have been two, but three or four 16) Three horses are mentioned in Rv. x. 33, 5, and Pras2t2i in Rv. i. 39, 6; viii. 7, 28, etc., may have the sense of ‘third horse.’ See also S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 4, 11; 2, 4, 9, etc.; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 13, 12. For four horses, cf. Rv. ii. 18, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 3, 17; 1, 4, 11; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 21, n. 1. were often used. It is uncertain whether, in these cases, the extra horse was attached in front or at the side; possibly both modes were in use. Even five steeds could be employed. 17) Rathah2 pan5cava1hi1, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 3. In the parallel passage the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 7, 2, has pras2t2iva1hi1. Horses were normally used for chariots, but the ass (gardabha) 18) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 9, 4. or mule (as4vatari1) 19) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 2, 1; v. 13, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 9, 1. are also mentioned. The ox was employed for drawing carts, and in fact derived its name, Anad2va1h, from this use. Sometimes a poor man had to be content with a single steed, which then ran between two shafts. 20) Rv. x. 101, 11; 131, 3, and vi. 15, 19; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 13, 12; xxi. 13, 8, etc. In the chariot the driver stood on the right, while the warrior was on the left, as indicated by his name, Savyes2t2ha or Savyas2t2ha1, 21) This is the case in Av. viii. 8, 23, with Savyas2t2ha1, and in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 7, 9, 1, savyes2t2ha-sa1rathi occurs as a compound where the sense is certainly ‘the warrior and the charioteer.’ See also S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 8, and Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 1. The Greek notices speak of two warriors and a charioteer. Cf. the As4vins' car with its three seats. See von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 435. He could also sit when he wanted, for the chariot had seats, and an archer would naturally prefer to sit while shooting his arrows. The dimensions of the chariot are given in the S4ulba Su1tra 22) vi. 5 (Bu7rk, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 56, 344, 345). of A1pastamba at 188 An3gulis (finger-breadths) for the pole, 104 for the axle, and 86 for the yoke. The material used in its construction was wood, except for the rim of the wheel. 23) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 3, 16. The chariot used at the bridal procession was made of S4almali wood, Rv. x. 85, 20. For the chariot in the Epic, see Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 235-262; and cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 338, 339; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 245-252; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 38, n. 1. Many other parts of the chariot are mentioned, their names being often obscure in meaning: see An3ka, Nyan3ka, Uddhi, Paks2as, Pa1talya, Bhurij, Rathopastha, Rathava1hana.

रथकार
रथ-कार,
 ‘chariot-maker,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 5, 6. as one of those who are to be subject to the king, seeming to stand generally as an example of the industrial population. He is also referred to in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 17; xxx. 6. and in the Bra1hman2as: 3) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 8; iii. 4, 2, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 2, 17. in all these passages, as well a probably in the Atharvaveda also, the Rathaka1ra already forms a caste. The later system 4) Ya1jn5avalkya, i. 95. On the special position, in the later ritual, of the Rathaka1ra as a caste below the Vais4ya, but superior to the S4u1dra, cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 12, 13, and cf. Varn2a, see also Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 209, 210. regards the Rathaka1ra as the offspring of a Ma1his2ya (the son of a Ks2atriya husband and a Vais4ya wife) and a Karan2i1 (the daughter of a Vais4ya husband and a S4u1dra wife), but it is unreasonable to suppose that such an origin is historically accurate. The Rathaka1ras must rather be deemed to have been a functional caste. Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 152, 153. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 196 et seq. suggests that the Anu tribe formed the basis of the Rathaka1ra caste, referring to their worship of the R2bhus, who are, of course, the chariotmakers par excellence. But there is little ground for this view.

रथगृत्स
रथ-गृत्स
 in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (xv. 15) and the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (iii. 48, 9) denotes a ‘skilled charioteer.’ 1) Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 3, 1; kr2tsna, Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 8, 10; kr2tsa, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 9.

रथचक्र
रथ-चक्र,
 ‘chariot wheel,’ is often mentioned in the Bra1hman2as. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 43, 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 6, 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 3, 12; v. 1, 5, 2; xi. 8, 1, 11, etc. See Ratha and Cakra.

रथचर्षण
रथ-चर्षण
 occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 5, 19. where the sense is doubtful. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thought that some part of the chariot was meant, but the sense is perhaps only the ‘pathway of the chariot.’ 3) Cf. also the citation and explanation in Durga's commentary on the Nirukta, v. 12.

रथजूति
रथ-जूति
 in the Atharvaveda (xix. 44, 3) is either an adjective meaning ‘driving swiftly in a chariot,’ 1) ‘Of chariot-swiftness’ according to Whitney, Translation of the Athar vaveda, 967. Cf. his note on the passage. or a proper name, as Roth in the St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests. 

रथनाभि
रथ-नाभि,
 the ‘nave of the chariot-wheel,’ is mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xxxiv. 5. and in the Upanis2ads. 2) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 5, 5; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 4; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 8; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. vii. 15, 1, etc.

रथप्रोतदार्भ्य
रथ-प्रोत दार्भ्य
 (‘descendant of Darbha’) is mentioned in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (ii. 1, 3) perhaps as a king, but possibly as a priest.

रथप्रोष्ठ

 occurs as the name of a princely family in the Rigveda (x. 60, 5). See Subandhu.

रथमुख
रथ-मुख
 in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Av. viii. 8, 23; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 3, 2; v. 4, 9, 3, etc. denotes the fore-part of a chariot. Cf. Rathas4i1rs2a.

रथर्वी
रथर्वी
 is the name of a snake in the Atharvaveda (x. 4, 5).

रथवाहन
रथ-वाहन
 is the name in the Rigveda 1) vi. 75, 8. and later 2) Av. iii. 17, 3 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 5, 5 = Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 11 = Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 12 = Va1sis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, ii. 34. 35. See also Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxi. 10; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 9, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 3, 23 et seq. for a movable stand to hold the chariot. According to Roth, 3) Festgruss an Bo7htlingk, 95 et seq.; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 116. it corresponds to the Greek , on which the chariot rested when out of use. The word Rathava1hana-va1ha is employed in the sense of the two horses that draw the stand. 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 20, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 4, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 1. Weber 5) U7ber den Va1japeya, 27, n. 2, followed by Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 275. Weber, however, admits that the Rathava1hana may at times have served as a mere stand, like the Homeric  while Geldner expresses the opinion that it never has that sense. The use of the term Rathava1hanava1ha shows that the stand was movable. thinks it was used to convey the war chariot to the scene of action. 

रथवीतिदार्भ्य
रथवीति दार्भ्य
 (‘descendant of Darbha’) is mentioned once in the Rigveda 1) v. 61, 17. 19. as residing in places abounding in kine (gomati1r anu) far away among the hills, possibly the Hima1layas, and as the patron of the singer of the hymn. Later the tradition 2) See Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 50 et seq., 62, n. 2, and the criticism in Oldenberg, R2gveda-Neten, 1, 353, 354; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 359, 362. makes him the king, whose daughter S4ya1sva1s4va won for his wife by his father's and the Maruts' aid.

 in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 6, 4, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxix. 8. denotes the ‘axle of the chariot.’ Its length is given by the scholiast on the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) viii. 8, 6. as 104 An3gulas (‘finger-breadths’), which agrees with the statement in the A1pastamba S4ulba Su1tra. 3) vi. 5 (Bu7rk, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7udischen Gesellschaft, 56, 344, 345). See Ratha.

रथाह्न्य

 seems, in the phrase Uks2n2o Randhra occurring in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 7, 26), to be the name of a place, but the sense is very doubtful. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiii. 9, 13) Uks2n2o randhra is the name of a man.

रभि
रभि,
 occurring once in the Rigveda (viii. 5, 29), designates some part of the chariot. The term perhaps means ‘supporting shaft.’

रम्भ
रम्भ
 seems to mean a ‘staff’ or ‘support’ in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 45, 20). In another place (ii. 15, 9) a man is described as Rambhin, apparently as carrying a staff to support himself in old age; Sa1yan2a explains this word as ‘door-keeper’ (like one of the senses of dan2d2in, ‘staff-bearer,’ in later Sanskrit).

रम्भिणी
रम्भिणी
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 168, 3. Cf. i. 167, 3, and see Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 283. as being on the shoulders of the Maruts. A ‘spear’ seems to be meant, perhaps conceived as clinging (rambh = rabk, ‘clasp’) to the shoulders of a man. 

रयि
रयि
 is the common word for ‘wealth’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 73, 1; 159, 4; ii. 21, 6; iii. 1, 19; iv. 2, 7; 34, 10; 36, 9; vi. 6, 7; 31, 1, etc. and later. 2) Av. iii. 14, 1; vi. 33, 3; vii. 80, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 72; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 22; xiv. 22; xxvii. 6, etc. Special mention is often made of wealth in ‘heroes’ (vi1ra)--i.e., in ‘good sons,’ 3) Rv. ii. 11. 13; 30, 11; iv. 51, 10, etc. in horses, 4) Rv. v. 41, 5; viii. 6, 9, etc. in cattle, 5) Rv. v. 4, 11, etc. etc.

रशना
रशना
 means generally ‘cord’ or ‘rope.’ In the Rigveda the word ofter refers to various fastenings of a horse. In one passage 1) i. 162, 8. Cf. Rajju. the expression s4i1rs2an2ya1 ras4ana1, ‘head rope,’ perhaps means not so much ‘reins’ as ‘headstall.’ In others 2) Rv. i. 163, 2. 5; x. 79, 7. the sense of ‘traces’ seems certain, though sometimes 3) Rv. iv. 1. 9; ix. 87, 1; x. 18, 14. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 4, 3. ‘reins’ or ‘traces’ may equally well be intended. Elsewhere the more general sense of ‘rope’ for stening is meant. 4) Rv. ii. 28, 5; Av. viii. 78, 1; x. 9, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 46; xxii. 2; xxviii. 33; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 6. 4, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 6, 3. 10, etc. Cf. the use of Ras4ana1 as equivalent to ‘finger’ in Rv. x. 4, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249.

रश्मि
1. Ras4mi is not rarely found in the sense of ‘rope’ 1) Rv. i. 28, 4; iv. 22, 8; viii. 25, 18, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 19, 3, etc. generally; but more usually it denotes either the ‘reins’ or the ‘traces’ 2) Rv. viii. 7, 8; x. 130, 7, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 4, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 14; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 4, 2, etc. In Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 37, 1, the two inner (antarau) reins or traces of the chariot are mentioned. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249. of a chariot, either sense being equally good in most passages.

रश्मि
2. Ras4mi in the Rigveda 1) i. 35, 7; iv. 52, 7; vii. 36, 1; 77, 3, etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 32, 1; xii. 1, 15; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 1, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 2, 3, 14, etc. regularly denotes a ‘ray’ of the sun. 

रसा
रसा
 is found in three passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 12; v. 53, 9; x. 75, 6. In v. 53, 9, the phrase rasa1nitabha1 is found. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 202, is inclined to regard anitabha1 as an epithet of Rasa1, perhaps for amitabha1, ‘of unmeasured splendour,’ but this is hardly probable. It seems better to take Anitabha1 as the name of an otherwise unknown river. Cf. Max Mu7ller, India, 166, 173, n. clearly as the name of a real stream in the extreme north-west of the Vedic territory. Elsewhere 2) Rv. v. 41, 15; ix. 41, 6; x. 100, 1, 2 (cf. Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 348; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 100 et seq.); 121, 4. it is the name of a mythic stream at the ends of the earth, which as well as the atinosphere it encompasses. It is reasonable to assume that, as in the case of the Sarasvati1, the literal is the older sense, and to see in the river a genuine stream, perhaps originally the Araxes or Jaxartes, because the Vendidad mentions the Ran3ha1, the Avestan form of Rasa1. But the word seems originally to allude merely to the ‘sap’ or ‘flavour’ of the waters, 3) Rv. iv. 43, 6; viii. 72, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 15, 16; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 323; Brunnhofer, Iran und Turan, 86; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 567-569. and so could be applied to every river, like Sarasvati1.

रसाशिर्
रसाशिर्
 as an epithet of Soma in the Rigveda 1) iii. 48, 1, where Sa1yan2a explains rasa as ‘milk.’ Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 211, n. 5. means ‘mixed with juice’--i.e., with milk.

रहसू
रह-सू,
 ‘bearing in secret,’ is a term applied in one passage of the Rigveda (ii. 29, 1) to an unmarried mother. Cf. Pati and Dharma.

रहस्युदेवमलिम्लुच्
रहस्यु देव-मलिम्लुच्
 is the name, in the Pan5cavims4a Bra1hman2a (xiv. 4, 7), of a mythical person who at Munimaran2a slew the saintly Vaikha1nases.

रहूगण
रहू-गण
 is the name of a family mentioned in the plural in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) i. 78, 5. According to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen, Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 236, n. 1. they were connected with the Gotamas, as is shown by the name Gotama Ra1hu1gan2a. 

राका
राका
 in the Rigveda 1) ii. 32, 4; v. 42, 12. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 8, 1; iii. 4, 9, 1. 6; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 8; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 37, 2, 6; 47, 4, etc.; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 13, 1. etc. denotes the full moon day as a personification. Cf. Candrama1s.

राजकर्तृ
राज-कर्तृ,
 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 17, 5. or Ra1ja-kr2t, 2) Av. iii. 5, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 7; xiii. 2, 2, 18. ‘king-maker,’ is the term applied in the Atharvaveda and the Bra1hman2as to those who, ‘not themselves kings,’ 3) Loc. cit. aid in the consecration of the king. In the S4atapatha 2) Av. iii. 5, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 7; xiii. 2, 2, 18. the persons meant and specified are the Su1ta, ‘charioteer,’ and the Gra1man2i1, ‘village chief,’ probably a representative chief from the village nearest to the place of consecration, as Eggeling 4) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 60, n. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 199 et seq. suggests. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 17. 5. according to the commentator's explanation, the father, brother, etc., are meant; in the Atharvaveda, 2) Av. iii. 5, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 7; xiii. 2, 2, 18. also, the meaning of the expression is not stated in the text.

राजकुल
राज-कुल,
 a ‘kingly family,’ is mentioned in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 28, 4), where, it is to be noted, such a family is ranked after, not before, a Bra1hman2a Kula, a ‘Brahmin family.’

राजन्
1. Ra1jan, ‘king,’ is a term repeatedly occurring in the Rigveda 1) iii. 43, 5; v. 54, 7, etc. and the later literature. 2) Av. iv. 22, 3. 5; viii. 7, 16, etc. It is quite clear that the normal, though not universal form of government, in early India was that by kings, as might be expected in view of the fact that the A1ryan Indians were invaders in a hostile territory: a situation which, as in the case of the A1ryan invaders of Greece and of the German invaders of England, resulted almost necessarily in strengthening the monarchic element of the constitution. 3) Cf. Stubbs, Constitutional History of England, 59 et seq. The mere patriarchal organization of society is not sufficient, as Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 162. assumes, to explain the Vedic kingship. Tenure of Monarchy.--Zimmer 5) Op. cit., 162 et seq. So Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 188; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 336. is of opinion that while the Vedic monarchy was sometimes hereditary, as is indeed shown by several cases where the descent can be traced, 6) E.g., Vadhryas4va, Divoda1sa, Pijavana, Suda1s; or Purukutsa, Trasadasyu, Mitra1tithi, Kurus4ravan2a Upamas4ravas, etc.; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386. So a ‘kingdom of ten generations’ (Das4apurus2am2ra1jya) is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 9, 3, 3; and cf. v. 4, 2, 8; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 12. 17. yet in others the monarchy was elective, though it is not clear whether the selection by the people was between the members of the royal family only or extended to members of all the noble clans. It must, however, be admitted that the evidence for the elective monarchy is not strong. As Geldner 7) Vedische Studien, 2, 303. argues, all the passages cited 8) Rv. x. 124, 8; 173; Av. i. 9; iii. 4; iv. 22. can be regarded not as choice by the cantons (Vis4), but as acceptance by the subjects (vis4): this seems the more probable sense. Of course this is no proof that the monarchy was not sometimes elective: the practice of selecting one member of the family to the exclusion of another less well qualified is exemplified by the legend in Ya1ska 9) Nirukta, ii. 10. of the Kuru brothers, Deva1pi and S4antanu, the value of which, as evidence of contemporary views, is not seriously affected by the legend itself being of dubious character and validity. Royal power was clearly insecure: there are several references to kings being expelled from their realms, and their efforts to recover their sovereignty, 10) The technical term is apa-ruddha. Cf. Av. iii. 3, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xii. 12, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 9, 3, 3, etc.; Kaus4ika Su1tra, xvi. 30; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 37 et seq. and the Atharvaveda contains spells in the interest of royalty. 11) Especially iii. 3. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 111 et seq. The King in War.--Naturally the Vedic texts, after the Rigveda, contain few notices of the warlike adventures that no doubt formed a very considerable proportion of the royal functions. But the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 12) i. 8, 4, 1. contains the statement that the Kuru-Pan5ca1la kings, who, like the Brahmins of those tribes, stand as representatives of good form, used to make their raids in the dewy season. The word Uda1ja, too, with its variant Nira1ja, records that kings took a share of the booty of war. The Rigveda 13) E.g., the Da1s4ara1jn5a, Rv. vii. 18. 33, 83, and cf. Rv. iii. 33, 53. has many references to Vedic wars: it is clear that the Ks2atriyas were at least as intent on fulfilling their duty of war as the Brahmins on sacrificing and their other functions. Moreover, beside offensive war, defence was a chief duty of the king: he is emphatically the ‘protector of the tribe’ (gopa1 janasya), or, as is said in the Ra1jasu1ya (‘royal consecration’), ‘protector of the Brahmin.’ 14) Rv. iii. 43, 5. References to attacks on aborigines are common in the Rigveda--e.g., ii. 12, 11; iv. 26, 3; vi. 26, 5; 33, 4, etc. For later references to war, cf. Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 17; x. 3; xxviii. 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 8, 3; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, v. 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 4, 2 et seq.; and Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 187, 215. In the Ra1jasu1ya the protection of the Brahmin is compensated with the ‘eating’ of the Vis4, the latter interesting the king more than the older duty of protection. See Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 12. 17. His Purohita was expected to use his spells and charms to secure the success of his king's arms. The king no doubt fought in person: so Pratardana met death in war according to the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad; 15) iii. 1. and in the Ra1jasu1ya the king is invoked as ‘sacker of cities’ (pura1m2 bhetta1). The King in Peace.--In return for his warlike services the king received the obedience 16) See, e.g., Janaka's offer of the Videhas as slaves to Ya1jn5avalkya, Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 4, 30, and see ibid., ii. 1, 20; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 10, etc.; Rv. i. 67, 1; iv. 50, 8. --sometimes forced 17) Rv. ix. 7, 5. Cf. vii. 6, 5, etc.; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 18, 2. --of the people, and in particular their contributions for the maintenance of royalty. The king is regularly 18) See Bali, and cf. Rv. i. 65, 4; Av. iv. 22, 7; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 29; viii. 12. 17; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iv. 12; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 2, 17; iv. 2, 1, 3, 17; v. 3, 3, 12; 4, 2, 3; x. 6, 2, 1; xiii. 2, 9, 6, 8, etc.; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 93, n.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 246; Pischel and Geldner, Vedische Stadien, 1, xvi; Winternitz, Geschichte der indischen Litteratur, 1, 173, 174; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 161. It is to this form of taxation that the share of village (gra1me), horses (as4ves2u), and kine (gos2u) of Av. iv. 22, 2, is to be referred. It is significant that the village and cattle are put on the same footing, as tending to refute the argument that the king was supreme landowner. See n. 31 below. For the rate of taxation, which later was one sixth, cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 85, 86; India, Old and New, 238 et seq.; 333; Mrs. Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, 860. regarded as ‘devouring the people,’ but this phrase must not be explained as meaning that he necessarily oppressed them. It obviously has its origin in a custom by which the king and his retinue were fed by the people's contributions, a plan with many parallels. It is also probable that the king could assign the royal right of maintenance to a Ks2atriya, thus developing a nobility supported by the people. Taxation would not normally fall on Ks2atriya or Brahmin; the texts contam emphatic assertions of the exemption of the goods of the latter from the royal bounty. 19) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 6, 2, 18; 7, 1, 13. See also Bra1hman2a (above, 2, 83) for the claim of the Brahmins to serve only king Soma, not the temporal king.In the people, however, lay the strength of the king. 20) Cf., e.g., Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 8; iii. 11, 8; iv. 4, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 5. See also Bali. In return the king performed the duties of judge. Himself immune from punishment (a-dan2d2ya), he wields the rod of punishment (Dan2d2a). 21) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 7. It is probable that criminal justice remained largely in his actual administration, for the Su1tras 22) E.g., Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xii. 43 et seq. preserve clear traces of the personal exercise of royal criminal jurisdiction. Possibly the jurisdiction could be exercised by a royal officer, or even by a delegate, for a Ra1janya is mentioned as an overseer (adhyaks2a) of the punishment of a S4u1dra in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 23) xxvii. 4. Cf. Ks2atriya, n. 18. In civil justice it may be that the king played a much less prominent part, save as a court of final appeal, but evidence is lacking on this head. The Madhyamas4i1 of the Rigveda was probably not a royal, but a private judge or arbitrator. A wide criminal jurisdiction is, however, to some extent supported 24) Cf. Rv. i. 25, 13; iv. 4, 3; vi. 67, 5; vii. 61, 3; 87, 3; x. 10, 8 (= Av. xviii. 1, 9); Av. iv. 16, 4. by the frequent mention of Varun2a's spies, for Varun2a is the divine counterpart of the human king. 25) See Foy, Die ko1nigliche Gewalt, 80 et seq. Possibly such spies could be used in war also. 26) Cf. Rv. viii. 47, 11; Foy, op. cit., 84. The reference is not certain. There is no reference in early Vedic literature to the exercise of legislative activitv by the king, though later it is an essential part of his duties. 27) See Foy, op. cit., chap. iii. Nor can we say exactly what executive functions devolved on the king. In all his acts the king was regularly advised by his Purohita; he also had the advantage of the advice of the royal ministers and attendants (see Ratnin). The local administration was entrusted to the Gra1man2i1, or village chief, who may have been selected or appointed by the king. The outward signs of the king's rank were his palace 28) Cf. Varun2a's palace, Rv. ii. 41, 5; vii. 88, 5. The throne, A1sandi1, is used to form the name of Janamejaya's royal city, Asandi1vant. Cf. also S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 1 et seq.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 12, 3-5. and his brilliant dress. 29) See, e.g., Rv. i. 85, 8; viii. 5, 38; x. 78, 1, etc. So the king is the great lord of riches (dhana-patir dhana1na1m), Av. iv. 22, 3, and in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 31, he is likened to the Nyagrodha tree. The King as Landowner.--The position of the king with regard to the land is somewhat obscure. The Greek notices, 30) See Diodorus, ii. 40; Arrian, Indica, 11; Strabo, p. 703, and Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 87 et seq. in which, unhappily, it would be dangerous to put much trust, since they were collected by observers who were probably little used to accurate investigations of such matters, and whose statements were based on inadequate information, vary in their statements. In part they speak of rent being paid, and declare that only the king and no private person could own land, while in part they refer to the taxation of land. Hopkins 31) India, Old and New, 221 et seq. is strongly of opinion that the payments made were paid for protection -i.e., in modern terminology as a tax, but that the king was recognized as the owner of all the land, while yet the individual or the joint family also owned the land. As against BadenPowell, 32) Village Communities in India, 145; Indian Village Community, 207 et seq. who asserted that the idea of the king as a landowner was later, he urges for the Vedic period that the king, as we have seen, is described as devouring the people, and that, according to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 33) vii. 29, 3. the Vais4ya can be devoured at will and maltreated (but, unlike the S4u1dra, not killed); and for the period of the legal Su1tras and S4a1stras he cites Br2haspati and Na1rada as clearly recognizing the king's overlordship, besides a passage of the Ma1nava Dharma S4a1stra 34) viii. 39. which describes the king as ‘lord of all,’ a phrase which Bu7hler 35) In his note on Manu, loc. cit., Sacred Books of the East, 25, 259. was inclined to interpret as a proof of landowning. The evidence is, however, inadequate to prove what is sought. It is not denied that gradually the king came to be vaguely conceived--as the English king still is--as lord of all the land in a proprietorial sense, but it is far more probable that such an idea was only a gradual development than that it was primitive. The power of devouring the people is a political power, not a right of ownership; precisely the same feature can be traced in South Africa, 36) See Keith, Journal of the African Society, 6, 202 et seq. The evidence, so far as it goes, of other A1ryan peoples does not support the theory of original kingly ownership. Such ownership did not exist, as far as can be seen, in Anglo-Saxon times (English Historical Review, viii. 1-7). nor in Homeric Greece (Lang, Homer and His Age, 236 et seq.), nor at Rome. where the chief can deprive a man arbitrarily of his land, though the land is really owned by the native. The matter is ultimately to some extent one of terminology, but the parallel cases are in favour of distinguishing between the political rights of the crown, which can be transferred by way of a grant, and the rights of ownership. Hopkins 37) Loc. cit. thinks that the gifts of land to priests, which seems to be the first sign of land transactions in the Bra1hman2as, was an actual gift of land; it may have been so in many cases, but it may easily also have been the grant of a superiority: the Epic grants are hardly decisive one way or the other. For the relations of the king with the assembly, see Sabha1; for his consecration, see Ra1jasu1ya. A-ra1ja-ta1, ‘lack of a king,’ means ‘anarchy.’ 38) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 9, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 14, 6; Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 74. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 162 et seq.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 84 et seq.; Foy, Die ko7nigliche Gewalt nach den Dharmasu1tren (Leipzig, 1895); Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 46 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, 860, 861.

राजन्
2. Ra1jan in several passages-means no more than a ‘noble of the ruling house,’ or perhaps even merely a ‘noble,’ there being 1 Cf. Rv. i. 40, 8; 108, 7; x. 42, 10; 97, 6; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 8, 3; v. 7, 6, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xl. 13; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 48; xxvi. 2; Av. xix. 62, 1, and possibly ii. 6, 4, etc.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 236, 237. Possibly ra1jn5ah2 in Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 5, may be taken in this sense. The king there is said to be a non-A1ryan, but the reading is corrupt, and Oertel's conjecture is not probable. Cf. Ra1jya, n. 2. no decisive passage. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 176, 177. sees traces in one passage of the Rigveda 3) x. 97, 6. He also compares Av. i. 9; iii. 4; iv. 22, where the king is referred to as superior to the other royal personages. that in times of peace there was no king in some states, the members of the royal family holding equal rights. He compares this with the state of affairs in early Germany. 4) The case of the Cherusci and Arminius' attempt to make himself king, which his relatives, the royal family, foiled (see Tacitus, Annals, ii. 88). But the passage merely shows that the nobles could be called Ra1jan, and is not decisive for the sense ascribed to it by Zimmer. Of course this state of affairs is perfectly possible, and is exemplified later in Buddhist times. 5) Cf. Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 19.

राजनि
राजनि,
 ‘descendant of Rajana,’ is the patronymic of Ugradeva in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11) and the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka (v. 4. 12).

राजन्य
राजन्य
 is the regular term in Vedic literature 1) Only once in the Rv. in the late Purus2a-su1kta, x. 90, 12; but often in the Av.: v. 17, 9; 18, 2; vi. 38, 4; x. 10, 18; xii. 4, 32 et seq.; xv. 8, 1; xix. 32, 8; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 13, 1; 5, 4, 4; 10, 1; v. 1, 10, 3, etc. Even in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, where, on the whole, the later use of Ks2atriya prevails, the Ra1janya is often mentioned. See Eggeling's index, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 561. for a man of the royal family, probably including also those who were not actually members of that family, but were nobles, though it may have been originally restricted to members of the royal family. This, however, does not appear clearly from any passage; the term may originally have applied to all the nobles irrespective of kingly power. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) Cf. xiii. 4, 2, 17, with xiii. 1, 6, 2. the Ra1janya is different from the Ra1japutra, who is literally a son of the king. The functions and place of the Ra1janya are described under Ks2atriya, which expression later normally takes the place of Ra1janya as a designation for the ruling class. His high place is shown by the fact that in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) ii. 5, 4, 4. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 258 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 191. It is quite likely that the noble families not related to the royal family were families of minor princes whose rule was merged in that of the king on the formation of a powerful tribe, as was the case in Germany. he is ranked with the learned Brahmin and the Gra1man2i1 (who was a Vais4ya) as having reached the height of prosperity (gata-s4ri1).

राजन्यबन्धु
राजन्य-बन्धु
 denotes a Ra1janya, but usually with a depreciating sense. Thus in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xi. 6, 2, 5. Janaka is called by the Brahmins, whom he defeated in disputation, ‘a fellow of a Ra1janya’; the same description is applied to Prava1han2a Jaivali in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 2) vi. 1, 5. for a similar reason. On the other hand, in one passage 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 5, 2. 10, where cf. Eggeling's note, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 370, n. 1. A similar case is apparently i. 2, 4, 2, where any special contempt cannot be meant. where reference is made to men eating apart from women, princes are said to do so most of all: the term Ra1janyabandhu cannot here be deemed to be contemptuous, unless, indeed, it is the expression of Brahmin contempt for princes, such as clearly appears in the treatment of Nagnajit in another passage. 4) viii. 1, 4, 10. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 515. Again, in a passage 5) i. 1, 4, 12. in which the four castes are mentioned, the Vais4ya precedes the Ra1janyabandhu, a curious inversion of the order of the second and third castes. 6) Eggeling, op. cit., 12, 28.

राजन्यर्षि
राजन्य-र्षि,
 ‘royal sage,’ is a term applied to Sindhuks2it in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xii. 12, 6. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 235, n. 3, and see Varn2a (p. 261). The story about him is, however, purely mythical.

राजपति
राज-पति,
 ‘lord of kings,’ is found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xi. 4, 3, 9) as an epithet of Soma. It is not used elsewhere as a title of imperial temporal supremacy: see Ra1jya. 

राजपितृ
राज-पितृ
 is one of the titles given to the king in the rite of the Ra1jasu1ya (‘royal consecration’) according to the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 12, 5; 17, 5). It probably designates the king as ‘father of a king,’ and indicates the hereditary character of the monarchy. Possibly the later plan 1) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 139. The sense of ‘having a king as father’ is also possible. of associating the king's son in the monarchy prevailed in earlier times also.

राजपुत्र
राज-पुत्र,
 ‘king's son,’ ‘prince,’ seems to be capable of being interpreted literally in every passage of the older literature 1) Rv. x. 40, 3; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17, 6 (of Vis4va1mitra, but probably in a mythical sense); Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xix. 1, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiv. 8; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 5, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 2, 5; 5, 2, 5, etc. in which it is found, though it may also be capable of a wider interpretation. 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 1, may be cited as identifying the Ra1janya and the Ra1japutra. Later the Ra1japutra degenerates into a mere ‘landowner.’ 3) Jolly, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 50, 514, who points out that in the Ra1jataran3gin2i1, vii. 360, traces of the older position of the Ra1japutra are seen.

राजपुरुष
राज-पुरुष
 denotes a ‘royal servant’ in the Nirukta (ii. 3). Cf. Pu1rus2a.

राजभ्रातृ
राज-भ्रातृ,
 the ‘brother of the king,’ is mentioned as one of the eight Vi1ras, or supporters of the monarchy, in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xix. 1, 4. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30, n. 2. He is also alluded to elsewhere. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 13, 18, etc.

राजमात्र
राज-मात्र
 is found in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a (xxvii. 6) and the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xvii. 5, 3. 4; 15, 3), where it seems to include ‘the whole class of persons (who could be called) Ra1jan’--i.e., the Ra1japutras and the Ra1janyas. 

राजयक्ष्म
राज-यक्ष्म,
 ‘royal sickness,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 1. and several times later on. 2) Av. xi. 3, 39; xii. 5; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 5, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 3; xxvii. 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 7. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 375 et seq. identifies it with consumption: this identification seems certain, being supported by the later view of the disease. 4) Cf. Wise, System of Hindu Medicine, 321 et seq.; Jolly, Medicin, 88, 89, n. 2, who takes Ra1jayaks2ma as denoting the worst of diseases, not the disease cured by the king. Cf. Ra1ja1s4va. Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 697. But contrast ibid., 415. suggests ‘king's evil,’ or syphilis, as the sense, but this is not probable.

राजसूय
राज-सूय
 is the name in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 8, 1; xi. 7, 7. and the later literature 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 2, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 15, 8; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 1, 12, etc. of the ceremony of the ‘royal consecration.’ The rite is described at great length in the Su1tras, 3) See Weber, U7ber die Ko7nigsweihe, den Ra1jasu1ya; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 144-147; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 472, 491. The relation of the S4unah2s4epa episode formed part of the ritual. That this points to human sacrifice having once formed part of the ritual of the Ra1jasu1ya as supposed by Hillebrandt, loc. cit.; Weber, 47; and Oldenberg, 366, n. 1, seems very doubtful. Cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 844, 845. but its main features are clearly outlined in the Bra1hman2as, 4) Especially S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 3, 1 et seq. See also Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 1 et seq.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 1, 1 et seq. while the verses used in the ceremony are preserved in the Sam2hita1s of the Yajurveda. 5) See Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. Besides much mere priestly elaboration, the ritual contains traces of popular ceremonial. For example, the king is clothed in the ceremonial garments of his rank, and provided with bow and arrow as emblems of sovereignty. He is formally anointed; he performs a mimic cow raid against a relative of his; 6) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 3, 1 et seq. or engages in a sham fight with a Ra1janya. 7) Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 15 with commentary; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 100, n. 1. A game of dice is played in which he is made to be the victim; 8) See 2. Aks2a (p. 3) he symbolically ascends the quarters of the sky as an indication of his universal rule; and steps on a tiger skin, thus gaining the strength and the pre-eminence of the tiger. A list of the consecrated kings is given in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 9) viii. 21-23. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 8. where the royal inauguration is called the ‘great unction’ (maha1bhis2eka) connected with Indra. It corresponds generally with a list of As4vamedhins, ‘performers of the horse sacrifice,’ given in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 10) xiii. 5, 4. and the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra. 11) xvi. 9. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, xxiv, xxv.

राजस्तम्बायन
राज-स्तम्बायन,
 ‘descendant of Ra1jastamba,’ is the patronymic of Yajn5avacas in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) x. 4, 2, 1 (oxytone), 6, 5, 9 (proparoxytone). No stress need be laid on the accents of the Satapatha Bra1hman2a.

राजाधिराज
राजाधिराज,
 ‘king of kings,’ later a title of paramount sovereignty, is only found in Vedic literature in the late Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka (i. 31, 6) as a divine epithet.

राजाश्व
राजाश्व
 (‘king's horse’) in the Atharvaveda (vi. 102, 2) seems merely to denote a powerful horse.

राज्ञी
राज्ञी,
 ‘queen,’ is found in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 6, 2; 4, 2, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 8, 3, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 3, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 13; xv. 10. and in the Bra1hman2as. 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 6, 2; iii. 11, 3, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 23, 2, etc.

राज्य
राज्य
 in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 4, 2; iv. 8, 1; xi. 6, 15; xii. 3, 31; xviii. 4, 31. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 3, 4; 6, 6, 5; vii. 5, 8, 3, etc.; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 23, etc.; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 5, as emended by Roth, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxliii. regularly denotes ‘sovereign power,’ from which, as the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 3) v. 1, 1, 12. notes, the Brahmin is excluded. In addition to Ra1jya, the texts give other expressions of sovereign power. Thus the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 4) v. 1, 1, 3. contends that the Ra1jasu1ya sacrifice is that of a king, the Va1japeya that of a Samra1j or emperor, the status of the latter (Sa1mra1jya) being superior to that of the former (Ra1jya). The sitting on a throne (A1sandi1) is given in the same text 5) xii. 8, 3, 4. as one of the characteristics of the Samra1j. Elsewhere 6) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiv. 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 11, 5. Cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 2, 2. Sva1ra1jya, ‘uncontrolled dominion,’ is opposed to Ra1jya. In the ritual of the Ra1jasu1ya the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 7) viii. 12, 4. 5. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvii. 16, 3. gives a whole series of terms: Ra1jya, Sa1mra1jya, Bhaujya, Sva1ra1jya, Vaira1jya, Pa1rames2t2hya, and Ma1ha1ra1jya, while A1dhipatya, ‘supreme power,’ is found elsewhere. 8) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xv. 3, 35; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 2, 6. But there is no reason to believe that these terms refer to essentially different forms of authority. A king might be called a Maha1ra1ja or a Samra1j, without really being an overlord of kings; he would be so termed if he were an important sovereign, or by his own entourage out of compliment, as was Janaka of Videha. 9) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 1, 2. 6; 2, 2, 3, etc. That a really great monarchy of the As4oka or Gupta type ever existed in the Vedic period seems highly improbable. 10) Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30.

रात्री
रात्री
 is the most usual word in the Rigveda 1) i. 35, 1; 94, 7; 113, 1, etc. and later 2) Av. i. 16, 1; v. 5, 1, etc. for ‘night.’ Cf. Ma1sa.

राथीतर
राथीतर,
 ‘descendant of Rathi1tara,’ is the patronymic of Satyavacas in the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad (i. 9, 1), and occurs several times as the name of a teacher in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (vii. 4, etc.).

राथीतरीपुत्र
राथीतरी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Rathi1tara,’ is the name of a teacher in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, the pupil of Bha1luki1-putra, according to the Ka1n2va recension (vi. 5, 1), of the Kraun5ciki1putras according to the Ma1dhyam2dina (vi. 4, 32). 

राधगौतम

 (‘descendant of Gotama’) is the name of two teachers in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373, 384.

राधेय

 ‘descendant of Ra1dha1,’ is the metronymic of a teacher in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka (vii. 6). Cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 372.

राम
1. Ra1ma is the name of a man in the Rigveda. 1) x. 93, 14. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. thinks that he bore the patronymic Ma1yava, 3) Rv. x. 93, 15. but this is doubtful.

रामऔपतस्विनि
2. Ra1ma Aupa-tasvini (‘descendant of Upatasvina’) is the name of a teacher in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (iv. 6, 1, 7).

रामक्रातुजातेय
3. Ra1ma Kra1tu-ja1teya (‘descendant of Kratu-ja1ta’) Vaiya1ghra-padya (‘descendant of Vya1ghrapad’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of S4an3ga S4a1t2ya1yani A1treya, who is mentioned in two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 40, 1; iv. 16, 1).

राममार्गवेय
4. Ra1ma Ma1rga-veya is the name of a man of the priestly family of the S4ya1parn2as in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) vii. 27, 3. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 345, n.; Muir Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 438.

 in a few passages 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 8, 3; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, v. 8, 13; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxii. 7. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 74, 84. seems to have the sense of a ‘hetaera.’

रायोवाज
रायो-वाज

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 233; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 149, who suggests ‘mule’ as a possible sense in Rv. iii. 53, 5. denotes an ‘ass.’

रास्ना
रास्ना
 in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 30; xi. 59; xxxviii. 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 1, 2, 2; iv. 1, 5, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, i. 2; xvi. 5; xix. 6, etc. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a denotes ‘girdle’ or ‘band,’ like Ras4ana1 and Ras4mi. vi. 2, 2, 25; 5, 2, 11, 13. Cf. ra1sna1va, ‘girdled,’ iv. 1, 5, 19.

राहु
राहु,
 the demon that eclipses the sun, seems to be referred to in one passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) xix. 9, 10. Cf. Kaus4ika Su1tra, 100; Indische Studien, 1, 87; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 914. The reading here is somewhat uncertain, but Ra1hu is probably meant.

राहूगण
राहू-गण,
 ‘descendant of Rahu1-gan2a,’ is the patronymic of Gotama in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) 1. 4, 1, 10. 18; xi. 4, 3, 20. Cf. also Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 81, 3; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 151, 152; Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 8.

Nirukta, iii. 5; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 49, 50; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 239 et seq. and later 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 18, 9 (of S4unah2s4epa's double inheritance, which, according to that text, is the learning of the Ga1thins and the sovereignty of the Jahnus; but see Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 16, who thinks the real succession was to the two houses, the A1n3girasa and the Kus4ika). denoting ‘inheritance.’ 1) iii. 31, 2, on which cf.

Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 2, 3; v. 1, 10, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 40, etc. denotes an ornament, probably of gold, usually worn on the breast. Being in several passages used of the sun, it probably had the form of a disk. In the Bra1hman2as 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 1, 20; v. 2, 1, 21; 4, 1, 13; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 2, 3; 9, 1, etc. So rukmin in S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 21, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 260, 263; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 160, who suggests as a possible sense ‘gold coin’; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the; East, 32, 112, 299. it designates a gold plate. See also Rajata.

रुक्मपाश
रुक्म-पाश
 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 7, 1, 7. 27; 3, 8; vii. 2, 1, 15, etc. denotes the ‘cord’ on which ‘the gold plate’ is hung.

रुरु
रुरु
 is one of the victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 19, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 27. 39; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14. 9. A kind of deer is meant. The Rigveda 2) vi. 75, 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83. mentions ‘deer-headed’ (ruru-s4i1rs2an) arrows, meaning such as have points made of deer's horn.

रुशम
रुशम
 is mentioned three times in the Rigveda 1) viii. 3, 13; 4, 2; 51, 9. as a prote4ge4 of Indra. The Rus4amas occur in another passage of the Rigveda 2) v. 30, 12-15. with their generous king R2n2am2caya; they are also referred to, with their king Kaurama, in a passage of the Atharvaveda. 3) xx. 127, 1.

रुशमा
रुशमा
 is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xxv. 13, 3), where she is said to have run round Kuruks2etra, and so to have defeated Indra, who understood her challenge to refer to the earth proper. The story indicates the connexion of the Rus4amas with the Kurus.

रुषती
रुषती
 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 117, 8. denotes, according to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 150. a maiden who was married to S4ya1va. On the other hand, Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. rus4ant. treats the word as rus4ati1, ‘white,’ and rus4ati1m seems clearly to be the reading of the text. It is doubtful what the meaning is, and whether S4ya1va is a proper name at all. 4) Cf. Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 110, who suggests that Ks2on2a may be a man's name.

रेक्णस्
रेक्णस्

रेवा
रेवा,
 a name of the Narmada1 (Nerbudda) river, otherwise occurring only in post-Vedic literature, is seen by Weber 1) Indian Literature, 123 (‘a native of the country south of the Reva1’). Cf. Indian Antiquary, 30, 273, n. 17. in the word Revottaras, which is found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 2) xii. 8, 1, 17; 9, 3, 1. and is certainly a man's name.

लब,
 ‘quail’ (Perdix chinensis) is one of the victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 24. Cf. Nirukta, vii. 2, where Rv. x. 119 is called the Labasu1kta; the Anukraman2i1 (Index), too, gives Aindra Laba as the author of that hymn. Cf. Br2haddevata1, viii. 40, with Macdonell's note. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90.

लम्बन
लम्बन
 is the reading in the Ka1n2va recension (v. 10, 1) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad for A1d2ambara, ‘drum,’ in the Ma1dhyam2dina recension (v. 12, 1).

लवण
लवण,
 ‘salt,’ is never mentioned in the Rigveda, only once in the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 76, 1. and not after that until the latest part of the Bra1hman2as, 2) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 17, 7 = Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad, iii. 17, 3. Cf. also Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 13, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 4, 12; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 1, 16; and see Strabo, xv. 1, 30. where it is regarded as of extremely high value. 3) It seems to be placed above gold in value in Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 17, 7. This silence in the early period is somewhat surprising if the regions then occupied by the Indians were the Panjab and the Indus valley, where salt abounds; it would at first sight seem less curious if the home of the early Vedic Indian is taken to be Kuruks2etra. 4) Cf. Map 19 in the Atlas of the Imperial Gazetteer of India, vol. 26, and see Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 21 et seq.; India, Old and New, 30 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 54, 55; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 318; Geiger, Ostiranische Kultur, 419; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 150. It is, however, quite conceivable that a necessary commodity might happen to be passed over without literary mention in a region where it is very common, but to be referred to in a locality where it is not found, and consequently becomes highly prized. 

लवन
लवन
 in the Nirukta (ii. 2) denotes the ‘mowing’ or ‘reaping’ of corn.

लोक
लोक
 denotes ‘world’ in the Rigveda 1) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2, quotes no example of this meaning for the Rigveda, where he sees the word used only in the sense of ‘place,’ ‘room,’ ‘free or open space.’ But Rv. x. 14, 9, is a fairly certain example of the wider sense. and later. 2) Av. viii. 9, 1. 15; iv. 38, 5; xi. 5, 7; 8, 10, etc.; in ix. 5, 14, the worlds of heaven (divya) and of earth (pa1rthiva) are distinguished; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxii. 11 et seq., etc. Mention is often made of the three worlds, 3) Av. x. 6, 31; xii. 3, 20; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 8; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 1, 7, 3, etc. and ayam2 lokah2, ‘this world,’ 4) Av. v. 30, 17; viii. 8, 8; xii. 5, 38; xix. 54, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 46, etc. is constantly opposed to asau lokah2, 5) Av. xii. 5, 38. 57; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 9, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 28, 2; viii. 2, 3, etc. ‘yonder world’ -i.e., ‘heaven.’ Loka itself sometimes means ‘heaven,’ 6) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 1, 7; x. 5, 4, 16; xi. 2, 7, 19; and so probably Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 13, 12. while in other passages several different sorts of world are mentioned. 7) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvi. 4; Kaus2i1 taki Bra1hman2a, xx. 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 6, 1; iv. 3, 36 et seq.; vi. 1, 18, etc.

लोध
लोध
 occurs in a very obscure verse of the Rigveda, 1) iii. 53, 23. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. conjectures that some sort of ‘red’ animal is meant, and Oldenberg 3) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 255. Cf. the obscure adhi1-lodha-karn2a in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 16, 1, perhaps meaning ‘having quite red ears.’ Ya1ska, Nirukta, iv. 12, equates the word with lubdha, ‘confused,’ but this does not suit the context. So also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 160; R2gveda, Glossar, 151, who sees in the word the designation of a noble steed. shows some reason for thinking that a ‘red goat’ is intended.

लोपा
लोपा
 is mentioned in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 1) v. 5, 18, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. where Sa1yan2a explains it as a kind of bird, perhaps the carrion crow (s4mas4a1nas4akuni). 

लोपामुद्रा
लोपा-मुद्रा
 appears in one hymn of the Rigveda, 1) i. 179, 4. where she is seemingly the wife of Agastya, whose embraces she solicits. 2) The story is differently told in the Br2haddevata1, iv. 57 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. See also Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenldndischen Gesellschaft, 39, 68; Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1909, 76 et seq.; Sieg.

Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84.

लोह
लोह,
 primarily an adjective meaning ‘red,’ is used as a neuter substantive to designate a metal, probably ‘copper,’ but possibly ‘bronze.’ It is mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xviii. 13. and the Taitti1riya Sam2hita1 2) iv. 7, 5, 1. as distinguished from S4ya1ma. It also occurs several times in the Bra1hman2as. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 2, 18; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 17, 7; vi. 1, 5; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 4, where Oertel takes ‘copper’ to be meant in contrast with Ayas, which he renders ‘brass.’ The sense of ‘iron’ is nowhere needed. Cf. Vincent Smith, Indian Antiquary, 34, 230; and on the early history of metals; Mosso, Mediterranean Civilization, 57-62. See Ayas.

लोहमणि
लोह-मणि
 in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (vi. 2, 5) denotes a ‘copper amulet,’ as Bo7htlingk 1) Cf. Little, Grammatical Index, 134. renders it, rather than a ‘lump of gold,’ as translated by Max Mu7ller following the scholiast.

लोहायस
लोहायस,
 ‘red metal,’ is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) v. 4, 1, 1. 2. where it is distinguished from Ayas and gold. In the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 2) iii. 17, 3. the contrast is with Ka1rs2n2a1 yasa, ‘iron,’ and in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 3) iii. 62, 6, 5. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 90, n.; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 189. with Kr2s2n2a1yasa, ‘iron.’ ‘Copper’ seems to be meant.

लोहित
लोहित,
 often occurring as an adjective meaning ‘red,’ is used as a neuter substantive in the Atharvaveda (xi. 3, 7) to denote a metal, presumably ‘copper.’ As a proper name it is found in A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, xxiv. 9, 7.

लोहितायस
लोहितायस,
 ‘red metal,’ ‘copper,’ is the variant of Loha in the Maitra1yan2i1 (ii. 11, 5; iv. 4, 4) and Ka1t2haka (xviii. 10) Sam2hita1s.

लोहिताहि
लोहिताहि,

लौहित्य
लौहित्य,
 ‘descendant of Lohita,’ is the patronymic of a large number of teachers in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, which clearly must have been the special object of study of the Lauhitya family. See Kr2s2n2adatta, Kr2s2n2ara1ta, Jayaka, Triveda Kr2s2n2ara1ta, Daks2a Jayanta, Palligupta, Mitrabhu1ti, Yas4asvin Jayanta, Vipas4cit Dr2d2hajayanta, Vaipas4cita Da1rd2hajayanti, Vaipas4cita Da1rd2hajayanti Dr2d2hajayanta, S4ya1majayanta, S4ya1masujayanta, Satyas4ravas. A Lauhitya or Lauhikya is also mentioned as a teacher in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka. 1) vii. 22; Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 50, n. 1. The form of name (Jayanta) affected by the family, and the silence of the older texts, proves that they were modern. V.

वंश
1. Vam2s4a, denoting the ‘rafters’ or ‘beams’ of the house as made of bamboo cane, is found in this sense from the Rigveda 1) i. 10, 1. onwards. 2) Av. iii. 12, 6; ix. 3, 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 8, 10; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 3, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ix. 1, 2, 25; s4a1la1-vam2s4a, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 1; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 1, where perhaps the main beam of the house is meant. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71, 153; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 346. Cf. Tiras4ci1navam2s4a, Pra1ci1navam2s4a, and see Gr2ha.

2. Vam2s4a (lit. ‘bamboo’) in the sense of ‘spiritual genealogy,’ 1) From the analogy of the successive joints of the bamboo.

 the designation of Bengal proper is not found in the earlier Vedic literature unless it is to be recognized in the curious word Van3ga1vagadha1h2, which occurs in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 1) ii. 1, 1. Cf. Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 200; Magadha-Van3ga-Matsya1h2 occurs in the Atharvaveda Paris4is2t2as (i. 7, 7). but that is very late. and which suggests amendment to Van3ga-Magadha1h2, ‘the Van3gas and the Magadhas,’ two neighbouring peoples. The name is certainly found in the Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra. 2) i. 1, 14. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 394, n.; Calan Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 56, 553.

वधर्
वधर्
 means a ‘weapon’ generally; it is used not merely of a divine, 1) i. 32, 9, etc. but also of a human 2) Rv. iv. 22, 9; viii. 22, 8; 24, 27. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 221. weapon in the Rigveda.

वधू
1. Vadhu1 is a frequent word for ‘woman’ in the Rigveda 1) v. 37, 3; 47, 6; vii. 69, 3; viii. 26, 13; x. 27, 12; 85, 30; 107, 9. and later. 2) Av. i. 14, 2; iv. 20, 3; x. 1, 1; xiv. 2, 9, 41, etc. It denotes, according to Delbru7ck, 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 414, 439. the woman as either married or as seeking a husband, or as a bride in the wedding ceremony. The word appears to be derived from a form of the root vah, ‘to carry,’ as is vahatu, ‘the bridal procession,’ thus meaning ‘she who is to be or has been conducted home.’ Zimmer, 4) Altindsiches Leben, 108. however, objects to this explanation, regarding vadhu1 as a derivative from a different root meaning ‘to marry.’

वधू
2. Vadhu1 is in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 19, 36. Cf. also v. 47, 6, as taken by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 319. taken by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3. to denote a ‘female animal,’ while Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 108, 109. urges that it means a ‘female slave.’ As far as the use of Vadhu1 goes, either meaning is abnormal, for if Vadhu1 never elsewhere means a female animal (from vah, to ‘draw’ a cart), neither does it denote a slave: as the passage refers to a gift of fifty Vadhu1s by Trasadasyu Paurukutsya to the singer, the latter must have been a polygamist of an advanced type to require fifty wives. The same doubt arises in the case of vadhu1mant, which is used in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda as an epithet of the chariot (Ratha), 4) i. 126, 3; vii. 18, 22. of horses (As4va), 5) viii. 68, 17. Cf. vi. 27, 8. and of buffaloes (Us2t2ra). 6) Av. xx. 127, 2. Zimmer sees in all cases a reference to slaves in the chariots or with the horses: this interpretation has the support of the Br2haddevata1. 7) iii. 147 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. Roth's version of the references to horses or buffaloes as ‘suitable for draught’ is not very happy; if vadhu1 is really a female animal vadhu1mant means rather ‘together with mares,’ or ‘together with female buffaloes,’ which makes reasonable sense. 8) Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 197; Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 35, 712 et seq.; Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v.

वध्रिमती
वध्रिमती,
 ‘having an impotent man as a husband,’ seems in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 13; 117, 24; vi. 62, 7; x. 39, 7; 65, 12. to be the name of a woman who owed the restoration of her husband's virility to the As4vins, and obtained a son, Hiran2yahasta. The word is, however, possibly only descriptive.

वध्र्यश्व
1. Vadhry-as4va, ‘having castrated horses,’ is the name in the Rigveda 1) vi. 61, 1; x. 69, 1 et seq. Sumitra, in the latter hymn, can hardly be a name of his. of a prince, the father of Divoda1sa, and an energetic supporter of the fire cult, as was his son after him. He is mentioned in a long list of names in the Atharvaveda. 2) iv. 29, 4. Cf. A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, xxiv. 6, 6. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie. 1, 97.

वध्र्यश्वआनूप
2. Vadhry-as4va A1nu1pa (‘descendant of Anu1pa’) is the name of the seer of a Sa1man, or chant, in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiii. 3, 17).

It also means ‘wooden cup’ used in the Soma ritual, 4) Rv. i. 55, 4; ii. 14, 9, etc. See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 163, 166, 193. and in one passage perhaps a part of the chariot. 5) viii. 34, 18.

वनर्गु
वनर्-गु,
 ‘forest-goer,’ is used in the Rigveda 1) x. 4, 6. and the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 36, 7. to designate robbers who haunt the forests. In the Sa1maveda 3) A1ran2ya Sam2hita1, iv. 9. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the term is more generally opposed to civilized men (kavayah2, ‘sages’; vanargavah2, ‘savages’).

वनस्पति
वनस्-पति,
 ‘lord of the forest,’ primarily denotes ‘tree,’ 1) Rv. i. 166, 5; iii. 34, 10; v. 7, 4; 41, 8, etc.; Av. xi. 6, 1 (distinguished from Vi1rudh and Oradhi); 9, 24, etc. and then ‘post’ or ‘pole.’ 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 8, 4; Av. ix. 3, 11, etc. In some passages it is applied either to a part of the chariot or to the chariot as a whole. 3) Rv. ii. 37, 3; iii. 53, 20; vi. 47, 26; Nirukta, ix. 11. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 251. It also means a ‘wooden drum’ 4) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 12. Cf. Av. xii. 3, 15. and a ‘wooden amulet,’ 5) Av. vi. 85, 1; x. 3, 8. 11. while in some passages 6) Rv. i. 91, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 23, etc. it denotes the plant par excellence, Soma.

वम्रक
वम्रक
 is mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 99, 12. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks that an ‘ant’ is meant. But Pischel, 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 238, 239. with more probability, thinks that it is a proper name, perhaps equivalent to Vamra, and denoting the child of a maiden who was saved from being devoured by ants. 4) Rv. iv. 19, 9; 30, 16.

वय्य
 occurs in several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 54, 6; 112, 6 (where Turvi1ti does not occur); ii. 13, 12; iv. 19, 6. in connexion with Turvi1ti, of whom the word is, according to Sa1yan2a, 2) On Rv. i. 54, 6. a patronymic in one passage. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., quoting ix. 68, 8, as a clear case. is inclined to think that the sense of ‘companion’ would suit all passages.

वर
वर
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 83, 2; v. 60, 4; ix. 101, 14; x. 85, 8. 9. and later 2) Av. ii. 36, 1. 5. 6; xi. 8, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 7, 1, etc. regularly denotes a ‘wooer.’

वरणावती
वरणावती
 is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 7, 1. It seems to be, as Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thought, the name of a stream, and is regarded by Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 201. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 20. as the Ganges. Bloomfield, 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 376. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 26, 27; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 154. while considering that a plant may, as Sa1yan2a thinks, be meant, yet regards a reference to a river as probable. Cf. Ka1s4i.

वरत्रा
 in the Rigveda 1) iv. 57, 4 (of the plough), etc. and later 2) Av. xi. 3, 10; xx. 135, 13. denotes a ‘thong’ or ‘strap.’ It was used to fasten the oxen to the yoke, 3) Rv. x. 60, 8; 102, 8; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 13. or perhaps to fasten the yoke to the pole. 4) This suits x. 60, 8, rather more naturally, and is so taken by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248, 249. Or, again, it denotes 5) Rv. x. 106, 5; Zimmer, op. cit., 156. the strap which was used in drawing up water from the well (Avata). 

वरशिख
वरशिख
 is the name of a leader whose tribe is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vi. 27, 4. 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 133, who thinks that Varas4ikha was the leader of the Turvas4a-Vr2ci1vants, but this is conjectural, and not very probable. Cf. Pa1rthava. In the Br2haddevata1, v. 124 et seq., the form of the name is Va1ras4ikha (‘descendant of Varas4ikha’), occurring in the plural only. as being defeated by Abhya1vartin Ca1yama1na

वराह
वराह,
 ‘boar,’ is found in the Rigveda 1) i. 61, 7; viii. 77, 10; ix. 97, 7; x. 28, 4 (cf. Kros2t2r2), etc. and later. 2) Av. viii. 7, 23; xii. 1, 48; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 2; xxv. 2, etc.; Maitra1yan2i Sam2hita1, iii. 14. 19, etc. The god Rudra is described as the ‘boar of heaven.’ 3) Rv. i. 114, 5. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 4, 2; vii. 1, 5, 1. etc. The use of dogs to hunt the boar is once alluded to. 4) Rv. x. 86, 4, an obscure passage. The variant form of the word, Vara1hu, is not used except metaphorically of divinities. 5) Rv. i. 88, 5; 121, 11; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 9, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81, 82; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 67, who points out that, even in the Rigveda, its use is predominantly metraphorical, x. 28, 4, and x. 86, 4, being the only clear instances of the real sense, and of these x. 86, 4, is doubtful. See also Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 66 et seq.

वरु
वरु
 is held by Sa1yan2a to be a proper name in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 23, 28; 24, 28; 26, 2. where it is accented as a vocative followed by sus2a1mn2e. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 39, 84, 85. considers that the name must be Varosus2a1man, despite its doubtful formation.

वरुणगृहीत
वरुण-गृहीत,
 ‘seized by Varun2a,’ is found in several passages 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 2, 1; vi. 4, 2, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 4, 5, 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 4, 1, etc. as a description of a man afflicted with dropsy, which is the disease sent by Varun2a as a punishment for sin. 2) Rv. vi. 74, 4; vii. 88. 7; Av. ii. 10, 1; iv. 16, 6. 7; xiv. 1, 57; 2, 49, etc. Cf.

वर्चिन्
वर्चिन्
 is the name of a foe of Indra in the Rigveda. 1) ii. 14, 6; iv. 30, 14. 15; vi. 47, 21; vii. 99, 5. Being called a Da1sa, 2) Rv. iv. 30, 15; vi. 47, 21. and coupled with S4ambara, he is probably to be regarded as a terrestrial foe, though he is also spoken of as an Asura. 3) Rv. vii. 99, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 103, n. 3; 3, 273; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 162 (F). He may possibly have been connected with the Vr2ci1vants.

वर्ण
1. Varn2a, ‘colour,’ is a common word in the Rigveda 1) i. 73, 7; 96, 5; 113, 2; iv. 5. 13; ix. 97, 15; 104, 4; 105, 1; x. 3, 3, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 22, 1. 2; 23, 2; xi. 8, 16; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 26, etc. A large number of colours are enumerated in Vedic literature, but it is not possible to deduce any clear information as to the accuracy with which the Vedic Indian distinguished colours, or as to the principle on which his distinctions were based. The Rigveda seems to show that red or yellow colours were the most noticed, but this may be accidental. 3) Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxxi et seq. ‘Black’ or ‘dark’ is denoted by kr2s2n2a, ‘white’ or ‘light-coloured’ by s4ukla or s4veta. ‘Black’ seems to be meant in one passage of the Rigveda 4) i. 140, 9. Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 8; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 250, 251. by s4yeni1 also. ‘Dark-grey’ or ‘dusky’ is expressed by s4ya1ma. 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 3, 7. The sense of ni1la 6) The ni1la of the Cha1ndogya Upanis4ad iii. 6, 1, is replaced by kr2s2n2a in the Kausi1taki Upanis2ad iv. to Cf. Rv. viii. 19, 31. In the post-Vedic language ni1la describes the colour of dark blue objects, such as indigo, sapphire, etc. That the word already had some such sense in the Rigveda is suggested by its use in allusions to the smoke of Agni. is doubtful, perhaps ‘dark-blue,’ ‘bluish-black.’ The series of words hari, harin2a, harit, harita, seems, on the whole, to denote ‘yellow,’ but ‘green’ is also a possible rendering, since the epithet is used of the frog. 7) Rv. vii. 103, 6, and cf. iii. 44, 3; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 365, n. ‘Brown’ is certainly the meaning of babhru, which is used of the Vibhi1taka nut (see Aks2a). ‘Reddish-brown’ seems to be the tinge implied by kapila 8) Rv. x. 27, 16; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 14. (‘monkey-coloured’), while pin3gala appears to denote a shade of brown in which yellow pre dominates, ‘tawny.’ 9) Av. xi. 5, 26; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 6, 2; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 14. ‘Yellow’ is expressed by pi1ta as well as pa1n2d2u. 10) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 3, 6. A garment of saffron (ma1ha1rajana) is mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 11) Loc. cit. Rudhira and lohita are red, while arun2a is ‘ruddy.’ Kalma1s2a means ‘spotted,’ 12) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxix. 58. and s4ilpa ‘dappled,’ 13) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 5; xxix. 58; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 22, 1; 6, 13, 1; 20, 1. while mingled shades like arun2a-pis4an3ga, ‘reddish brown,’ also occur. 14) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 6, 11, 6.

Cf. a verse in S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 25, 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 14. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 113, reads varn2as4es2as in Rv. v. 65, 5. is applied to denote classes of men, the Da1sa and the A1ryan Varn2a being contrasted, as other passages 2) See Dasyu, Da1sa; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 113, 114. There is no trace in Vedic literature of any real distinction of colour save this main one. In the Gopatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 23, the Brahman's colour is white (s4ukla); the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 6, calls the Vais4ya ‘white’ (s4ukla), the Ra1janya ‘swarthy’ (dhu1mra); and the later view makes the four castes black, yellow (pi1ta), red (rakta), and white respectively. See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 10, 11; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 153, etc., 176. Cf. also Av. iii. 4, 6, where Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 90, with hesitation suggests the reading varn2aih2, ‘castes.’ show, on account of colour. But this use is confined to distinguishing two colours: in this respect the Rigveda differs fundamentally from the later Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as, 3) Catva1ro varn2a1h2, ‘four castes,’ S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 9; vi. 4, 4, 13; s4audra varn2a, ‘S4u1dra caste,’ ibid., vi. 4, 4, 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 2, 25; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 4. Cf. also a1rya varn2a opposed to S4u1dra, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 17, and see Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 6, 7. Van2n2a appears in this sense sometimes in Pa1li. See Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 22, n. 4; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 53. where the four castes (varn2a1h2) are already fully recognized. (a) Caste in the Rigveda.--The use of the term Varn2a is not, of course, conclusive for the question whether caste existed in the Rigveda. In one sense it must be admitted to have existed: the Purus2a-su1kta, ‘hymn of man,’ in the tenth Man2d2ala 4) Rv. x. 90, 12 = Av. xix. 6, 6 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxi. 11 = Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iii. 12, 5. Cf. Muir, 12, 7-15, and references. clearly contemplates the division of mankind into four classes--the Bra1hman2a, Ra1janya, Vais4ya, and S4u1dra. But the hymn being admittedly late, 5) Max Mu7ller, Sanskrit Literature, 570 et seq.; Muir, loc. cit.; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 3 et seq.; Colebrooke, Essays, 1, 309; Arnold, Vedic Metre, p. 167. its evidence is not cogent for the bulk of the Rigveda. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 185-203. has with great force combatted the view that the Rigveda was produced in a society that knew the caste system. He points out that the Bra1hman2as 7) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 1. Cf. Av. xv., and see Vra1tya. show us the Vedic Indians on the Indus as unbrahminized, and not under the caste system; he argues that the Rigveda was the product of tribes living in the Indus region and the Panjab; later on a part of this people, who had wandered farther east, developed the peculiar civilization of the caste system. He adopts the arguments of Muir, 8) Sanskrit Texts, 12, 239 et seq., especially 258. derived from the study of the data of the Rigveda, viz.: that (a) the four castes appear only in the late Purus2asu1kta; (b) the term Varn2a, as shown above, covers the three highest castes of later times, and is only contrasted with Da1sa; (c) that Bra1hman2a is rare in the Rigveda, Ks2atriya occurs seldom, 9) Rv. viii. 104, 13; x. 109, 3, and cf. Ks2atriya. Ra1janya only in the Purus2asu1kta, where too, alone, Vais4ya and S4u1dra are found; (d) that Brahman denotes at first ‘poet,’ ‘sage,’ and then ‘officiating priest,’ or still later a special class of priest; (e) that in some only of the passages 10) Rv. i. 108, 7; iv. 50, 8 et seq.; viii. 7, 20; 45, 39; 53, 7; 81, 30; ix. 112, 1; x. 85, 29. where it occurs does Brahman denote a ‘priest by profession,’ while in others it denotes something peculiar to the individual, designating a person distinguished for genius or virtue, or specially chosen to receive divine inspiration. 11) Rv. x. 107, 6; 125, 5. Bra1hman2a, on the other hand, as Muir admits, 12) Op. cit., 2, 259. already denotes a hereditary professional priesthood. Zimmer connects the change from the casteless system of the Rigveda to the elaborate system of the Yajurveda with the advance of the Vedic Indians to the east, comparing the Germanic invasions that transformed the German tribes into monarchies closely allied with the church. The needs of a conquering people evoke the monarch; the lesser princes sink to the position of nobles; for repelling the attacks of aborigines or of other A1ryan tribes, and for quelling the revolts of the subdued population, the state requires a standing army in the shape of the armed retainers of the king, and beside the nobility of the lesser princes arises that of the king's chief retainers, as the Thegns supplemented the Gesiths of the Anglo-Saxon monarchies. 13) Maitland, Domesday Book, 164 et seq. At the same time the people ceased to take part in military matters, and under climatic influences left the conduct of war to the nobility and their retainers, devoting themselves to agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and trade. But the advantage won by the nobles over the people was shared by them with the priesthood, the origin of whose power lies in the Purohitaship, as Roth first saw. 14) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 117 et seq. Originally the prince could sacrifice for himself and the people, but the Rigveda 15) Rv. iii. 33, 8; vii. 18; 83. itself shows cases, like those of Vis4va1mitra and Vasis2t2ha illustrating forcibly the power of the Purohita, though at the same time the right of the noble to act as Purohita is seen in the case of Deva1pi A1rs2t2is2en2a. 16) Ya1ska, Nirukta, ii. 10, explaining Rv. x. 98. The Brahmins saw their opportunity, through the Purohitaship, of gaining practical power during the confusion and difficulties of the wars of invasion, and secured it, though only after many struggles, the traces of which are seen in the Epic tradition. 17) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 705 et seq.; Muir, op. cit., 2^2, 296479. The Atharvaveda 18) v. 17-19; Muir, 22, 280-289. also preserves relics of these conflicts in its narration of the ruin of the Sr2n5jayas because of oppressing Brahmins, and besides other hymns of the Atharvaveda (viiixii), the S4atarudriya litany of the Yajurveda 19) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 1-11 = Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 11-16 = Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9. 1-10. reflects the period of storm and stress when the aboriginal population was still seething with discontent, and Rudra was worshipped as the patron god of all sorts of evil doers. 20) Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 22 et seq.; Indian Literature, 110, 111. This version of the development of caste has received a good deal of acceptance in its main outlines, and it may almost be regarded as the recognized version. 21) See, e.g., von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 152 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 159 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 1 et seq.; Kaegi, Rigveda, n. 58. It has, however, always been opposed by some scholars, such as Haug, 22) Brahma und die Brahmanen, 1871. Kern, 23) Indische Theorien over de Standenverdeeling, 1871. Cf. for this, and the preceding work, Muir, op. cit., 22, 454 et seq. Ludwig, 24) Die Nachrichten des Rig und Atharvaveda u7ber Geographie, Geschichte und Verfassung des alten Indien, 36 et seq.; Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 237-243, etc. and more recently by Oldenberg 25) Religion des Veda, 373 et seq., and cf. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 51, 267 et seq. and by Geldner. 26) Vedische Studien, 2, 146, n. The matter may be to some extent simplified by recognizing at once that the caste system is one that has progressively developed, and that it is not legitimate to see in the Rigveda the full caste system even of the Yajurveda; but at the same time it is difficult to doubt that the system was already well on its way to general acceptance. The argument from the nonbrahminical character of the Vra1tyas of the Indus and Panjab loses its force when it is remembered that there is much evidence in favour of placing the composition of the bulk of the Rigveda, especially the books 27) iii. and vii. in which Suda1s appears with Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra, in the east, the later Madhyades4a, a view supported by Pischel, 28) Vedische Studien, 2, 218. Geldner, 29) Ibid., 3, 152. Hopkins, 30) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 18. and Macdonell. 31) Sanskrit Literature, 145. Nor is it possible to maintain that Brahman in the Rigveda merely means a ‘poet’ or ‘sage.’ It is admitted by Muir that in some passages it must mean a hereditary profession; in fact, there is not a single passage in which it occurs where the sense of ‘priest’ is not allowable, since the priest was of course the singer. Moreover, there are traces in the Rigveda of the threefold 32) Rv. viii. 35, 16-18. or fourfold 33) Rv. i. 113, 6. More doubtful are the references seen by Ludwig to the three castes in ii. 27, 8; vi. 51, 2; vii. 66, 10. division of the people into brahma, ks2atram, and vis4ah2, or into the three classes and the servile population. Nor even in respect to the later period, any more than to the Rigveda, is the view correct that regards the Vais4yas as not taking part in war. The Rigveda evidently 34) See Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 231 et seq., Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 94, 95, and see Vis4, Vais4ya. knows of no restriction of war to a nobility and its retainers, but the late Atharvaveda 35) iii. 19, 1; ix. 7, 9; xv. 9, 2. 3. equally classes the folk with the bala, ‘power,’ representing the Vis4 as associated with the Sabha1, Samiti, and Sena1, the assemblies of the people and the armed host. Zimmer 36) Op. cit., 194. explains these references as due to tradition only; but this is hardly a legitimate argument, resting, as it does, on the false assumption that only a Ks2atriya can fight. But it is (see Ks2atriya) very doubtful whether Ks2atriya means anything more than a member of the nobility, though later, in the Epic, it included the retainers of the nobility, who increased in numbers with the growth of military monarchies, and though later the ordinary people did not necessarily take part in wars, an abstention that is, however, much exaggerated if it is treated as an absolute one. The Ks2atriyas were no doubt a hereditary body; monarchy was already hereditary (see Ra1jan), and it is admitted that the S4u1dras were a separate body: thus all the elements of the caste system were already in existence. The Purohita, indeed, was a person of great importance, but it is clear, as Oldenberg 37) Religion des Veda, 382, 383. urges, that he was not the creator of the power of the priesthood, but owed his position, and the influence he could in consequence exert, to the fact that the sacrifice required for its proper performance the aid of a hereditary priest in whose possession was the traditional sacred knowledge. Nor can any argument for the non-existence of the caste system be derived from cases like that of Deva1pi. For, in the first place, the Upanis2ads show kings in the exercise of the priestly functions of learning and teaching, and the Upanis2ads are certainly contemporaneous with an elaborated caste system. In the second place the Rigvedic evidence is very weak, for Deva1pi, who certainly acts as Purohita, is not stated in the Rigveda to be a prince at all, though Ya1ska 38) ii. 10. calls him a Kauravya; the hymns attributed to kings and others cannot be vindicated for them by certain evidence, though here, again, the Bra1hman2as do not scruple to recognize Ra1janyars2is, or ‘royal sages’; and the famous Vis4va1mitra shows in the Rigveda no sign of the royal character which the Bra1hman2as insist on fastening on him in the shape of royal descent in the line of Jahnu. 39) See Vis4va1mitra and Jahnu. (b) Caste in the later Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as.--The relation between the later and the earlier periods of the Vedic history of caste must probably be regarded in the main as the hardening of a system already formed by the time of the Rigveda. 1. The Names of the Castes.--The most regular names are Bra1hman2a, Ra1janya, Vais4ya, and S4u1dra, 40) Rv. x. 90; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 1, 4. 5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 19, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 12; iii. 1, 1, 10; v. 5, 4, 9; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 6-11. or later Bra1hman2a, Ks2atriya, Vais4ya, and S4u1dra. 41) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 2, 27 (Ma1dhyam2dina = i. 4, 15 Ka1n2va); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 4, 4, 13; xiii. 6, 2, 10; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5.

The Relation of the Castes.--The ritual literature is full of minute differences respecting the castes. Thus, for example, the S4atapatha prescribes different sizes of funeral mounds for the four castes, 54) xiii. 8, 3, 11. Different modes of address are laid down for the four castes, 55) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 12. as ehi, ‘approach’; a1gaccha, ‘come’; a1drava, ‘run up’; a1dha1va, ‘hasten up,’ which differ in degrees of politeness. The representatives of the four castes are dedicated at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) to different deities. 56) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 6, 2, 10. For other similar differences in the Bra1hman2as, see Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 10, 1. 2; vii. 1, 1, 4. 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 4; xxxvii. 1; xxxix. 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 10; xiv. 24; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 23. 24; viii. 4, etc. The Su1tras have many similar rules. 57) A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 24, 11. 12, and see Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 20 et seq. But the three upper castes in some respects differ markedly from the fourth, the S4u1dras. The latter are in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 58) iii. 1, 1, 10. Cf. A1pastamba, cited in scholia on Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vii. 5, 7; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 8, 7; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 12 et seq. Generally S4u1dras are impure, and cannot be allowed at the place of sacrifice (deva-yajana), S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 1, 9. Cf. v. 3, 3, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 1, 6; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 10 (Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 8, does not contain this notice). declared not fit to be addressed by a Di1ks2ita, ‘consecrated person,’ and no S4u1dra is to milk the cow whose milk is to be used for the Agnihotra 59) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxi. 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 3. (‘fire-oblation’). On the other hand, in certain passages, the S4u1dra is given a place in the Soma sacrifice, 60) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 9. Cf. also ibid., i. 1, 4, 12. The scholiast on Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 1, 6, refers these notices to the Rathaka1ra alone, but this is obviously secondary. and in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 61) i. 1, 4, 8. there are given formulæ for the placing of the sacrificial fire not only for the three upper castes, but also for the Rathaka1ra, ‘chariot-maker.’ Again, in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 62) vii. 19, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 6; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 6; Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 81. the Bra1hman2a is opposed as ‘eater of the oblation’ to the members of the other three castes. The characteristics of the several castes are given under Bra1hman2a, Ks2atriya and Ra1jan, Vais4ya, S4u1dra: they may be briefly summed up as follows: The Vis4 forms the basis of the state on which the Brahman and Ks2atra rest; 63) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 2, 7, 16; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xvi. 4. the Brahman and Ks2atra are superior to the Vis4; 64) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ii. 8, 2; xi. 11, 9; xv. 6, 3; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 33, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxix. 10;  Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 10, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 4, 4, 13, etc. while all three classes are superior to the S4u1dras. The real power of the state rested with the king and his nobles, with their retainers, who may be deemed the Ks2atriya element. Engaged in the business of the protection of the country, its administration, the decision of legal cases, and in war, the nobles subsisted, no doubt, on the revenues in kind levied from the people, the king granting to them villages (see Gra1ma) for their maintenance, while some of them, no doubt, had lands of their own cultivated for them by slaves or by tenants. The states were seemingly small: 65) Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 32, for the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a and the later parts of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, with their traditions of As4vamedhas, ‘horse sacrifices,’ and their recollections of the glories of the Bharatas, represent a more advanced stage of social relations and of city life, but even they hardly know really great kingdoms. there are no clear signs of any really large kingdoms, despite the mention of Maha1ra1jas. The people, engaged in agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and trade (Van2ij), paid tribute to the king and nobles for the protection afforded them. That, as BadenPowell suggests, 66) Indian Village Community and Village Communities in India, where much stress is laid on the idea of a settlement of A1ryans on lands already occupied by Dravidian clans, much as Anglo-Saxon invaders on one theory occupied lands already held by Britons who became serfs, while the invaders were a landholding aristocracy, a theory supported by the fact that the normal holding of a hide is estimated at 120 acres. they were not themselves agriculturists is probably erroneous; some might be landowners on a large scale, and draw their revenues from S4u1dra tenants, or even A1ryan tenants, but that the people as a whole were in this position is extremely unlikely. 67) Cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 222. The point is much the same as that at issue between the different schools of opinion as to early English history. Did the A1ryans in India occupy the land as a people, driving out or exterminating or enslaving the Da1sas, and themselves carrying on the occupations of a people, or did they merely form a small aristocracy of superior military force, and were the Ks2atriyas the true A1ryans? The evidence of the Rigveda is really fatal to the latter alternative hypothesis. In war the people shared the conflicts of the nobles, for there was not yet any absolute separation of the functions of the several classes. The priests may be divided into two classes--the Purohitas of the kings, who guided their employers by their counsel, and were in a position to acquire great influence in the state, as it is evident they actually did, and the ordinary priests who led quiet lives, except when they were engaged on some great festival of a king or a wealthy noble. 68) For the superiority of the Bra1hman2a to the Ks2atriya or Ra1janya, see Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xi. 11, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 21; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 1, 12; 4, 4, 15; xiii. 1, 9, 1; 3, 7, 8; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 15, 8; viii. 9, 6; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 20, 12. The Bra1hman2a is, in his turn, dependent on the king (S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 3, 3; v. 4, 2, 7), and at the Ra1jasu1ya sits beside him, but is none the less superior (Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 2, 23). The Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 5, says the Ks2atra is over the Brahman, but this is not a usual view. Cf. xxvii. 4. A Bra1hman2a can get along without a Ks2atriya, but not vice versa (S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 4, 6), and a Ra1janya with a Bra1hman2a surpasses all other Ra1janyas (Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 10, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xix. 10; xxvii. 4, etc.). The relations and functions of the castes are well summed up in a passage of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 69) vii. 29. See Muir, op. cit., 1^2, 436 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 14. which treats of them as opposed to the Ks2atriya. The Bra1hman2a is a receiver of gifts (a1-da1yi1), a drinker of Soma (a1-pa1yi1), a seeker of food (a1vasa1yi1), 70) Weber, op. cit., 9, 326; 10, 14, prefers ‘moving’ or ‘dwelling’ everywhere. and liable to removal at will (yatha1ka1ma-praya1pyah2). 71) Muir, Haug, and Weber take the word as active in sense, ‘moving at will.’ But both the parallelism of the passage and the formation of the word require a passive causative sense. The reference is perhaps to the general political control of the king over the priest, whom he can ‘move on’ from place to place. The Vais4ya is tributary to another (anyasya balikr2t), to be lived on by another (anyasya1dyah2), and to be oppressed at will (yatha1ka1ma-jyeyah2). 72) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 29, 3. The S4u1dra is the servant of another (anyasya pres2yah2), to be expelled at will (ka1mottha1pyah2), and to be slain at pleasure (yatha1ka1ma-vadhyah2). 73) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 29, 4. The descriptions seem calculated to show the relation of each of the castes to the Ra1janya. Even the Bra1hman2a he can control, whilst the Vais4ya is his inferior and tributary, whom he can remove without cause from his land, 74) This seems to be the most probable reference of yatha1ka1majyeyah2. The expulsion of the Vais4ya is here not in allusion to quasi-ownership of land by the King or Ks2atriya; it is an act of royal authority, not an incident of tenure. See Keith, Journal of the African Society, 6, 202 et seq., and cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 222, 223. but who is still free, and whom he cannot maim or slay without due process. The S4u1dra has no rights of property or life against the noble, especially the king. The passage is a late one, and the high place of the Ks2atriya is to some extent accounted for by this fact. It is clear that in the course of time the Vais4ya fell more and more in position with the hardening of the divisions of caste. Weber 75) Ueber den Va1japeya, 10 et seq. shows reason for believing that the Va1japeya sacrifice, a festival of which a chariot race forms an integral part, 76) Ibid. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 247; Festgruss an Bo7htlingk, 40 et seq.; Rituallitteratur, 141. was, as the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 77) xvi. 17, 4. Cf. xv. 1, 1. says, once a sacrifice for a Vais4ya, as well as for a priest or king. But the king, too, had to suffer diminution of his influence at the hands of the priest: the Taittiri1ya texts 78) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 2, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 6, 1. Cf. La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 11, 1; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 9, 19; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41. xxiv. xxv. show that the Va1japeya was originally a lesser sacrifice which, in the case of a king, was followed by the Ra1jasu1ya, or consecration of him as an overlord of lesser kings, and in that of the Brahmin by the Br2haspatisava, a festival celebrated on his appointment as a royal Purohita. But the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 79) v. 1, 1, 1 et seq.; 2, 1, 19; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 1, 1-2. Weber, op. cit., 8, 9, interprets the situation differently from Eggeling. exalts the Va1japeya, in which a priest could be the sacrificer, over the Ra1jasu1ya, from which he was excluded, and identifies it with the Br2haspatisava, a clear piece of juggling in the interests of the priestly pretentions. But we must not overestimate the value of such passages, or the exaltation of the Purohita in the later books of the S4atapatha and Aitareya Bra1hman2as as evidence of a real growth in the priestly power: these books represent the views of the priests of what their own powers should be, and to some extent were in the Madhyades4a. Another side of the picture is presented in the Pa1li literature, 80) Fick, Dic sociale Gliederung, 107 et seq.; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 53 et seq.; 158. which, belonging to a later period than the Vedic, undoubtedly underestimates the position of the priests; while the Epic, 81) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 984 et seq. more nearly contemporaneous with the later Vedic period, displays, despite all priestly redaction, the temporal superiority of the nobility in clear light. Although clear distinctions were made between the different castes, there is little trace in Vedic literature of one of the leading characteristics of the later system, the impurity communicated by the touch or contact of the inferior castes, 82) See, e.g. Manu, iii. 239; v. 85; Fick, op. cit., 26 et seq. which is seen both directly in the purification rendered necessary in case of contact with a S4u1dra, and indirectly in the prohibition of eating in company with men of lower caste. 83) Va1sis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, xiv. 1 et seq.; Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xvii. 17; A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, i. 6, 18, 16 et seq.; ii. 4, 9, 7, with Bu7hler's note; Manu, iv. 210 et seq.; Vis2n2u, 41, 7 et seq.; Fick, op. cit., 30-33, who points out that the Ja1takas cohtain little evidence on the practice. Senart, Les Castes dans l'Inde, 48 et seq., 212 et seq., attributes great importance to the question of eating together, and compares the sacrificial meals of the gens at Rome, where strangers were excluded (Fustel de Coulanges, La Cite4 Antique, 117). But this is not conclusive; a caste is not a gens, and the gens excluded strangers only at a solemn festival, when the whole gens renewed its blood kinship. If we have no evidence exactly establishing this for the Gotra in early Vedic literature, we need not nesitate to believe that in the earliest Vedic period the Gotra had solemn festivals of union, and of communication with the dead, but that again does not explain or amount to the caste prohibition of taking food from an inferior. It is true that prohibition of eating in company with others does appear, 84) E.g., Aitareya A1ran2yaka, v. 3, 3. with Keith's note. but not in connexion with caste: its purpose is to preserve the peculiar sanctity of those who perform a certain rite or believe in a certain doctrine; for persons who eat of the same food together, according to primitive thought, acquire the same characteristics and enter into a sacramental communion. But Vedic literature does not yet show that to take food from an inferior caste was forbidden as destroying purity. 85) For a case of objection to eating food after another, see Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 10, 1. Possibly the idea there is that eating the food of a chief is dangerous, since the eater thus enters into possession of part of his substance, and consequently at once becomes an object of anger to the chief, as well as of danger to himself; for the chief may be so full of divine force that it would be unsafe for an ordinary man to be assimilated to him--a common idea in primitive societies. See also Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, v. 8, 13. Nor, of course, has the caste system developed the constitution with a head, a council, and common festivals which the modern caste has; for such an organization is not found even in the Epic or in the Pa1li literature. 86) Fick, op. cit., 24. Senart, op. cit., 219, 220, compares the family councils of Greece, Rome, and Germany (Leist, Altarisches Jus Civile, 273 et seq.; Kovalevsky, Famille et Proprie4te4 Primitives, 119; Fustel de Coulanges, op. cit., 118, 119). But here again the system may have applied to the Gotra without its really explaining the later appearance of the practice in the caste, and the absence of the mention of a council in the early and late literature alike is conclusive against its existence. The Vedic characteristics of caste are heredity, pursuit of a common occupation, and restriction on intermarriage. 3. Restrictions on Intermarriage.--Arrian, in his Indica, 87) xii. 8. 9. probably on the authority of Megasthenes, makes the prohibition of marriage between , no doubt ‘castes,’ a characteristic of Indian life. The evidence of Pa1li literature 88) Fick, op. cit., 34-40. is in favour of this view, though it shows that a king could marry whom he wished, and could make his son by that wife the heir appearent. But it equally shows that there were others who held that not the father's but the mother's rank determined the social standing of the son. Though Manu 89) x. 5; iii. 15. recognizes the possibility of marriage with the next lower caste as producing legitimate children, still he condemns the marriage of an A1ryan with a woman of lower caste. The Pa1raskara Gr2hya Su1tra 90) i. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 21, 74. allows the marriage of a Ks2atriya with a wife of his own caste or of the lower caste, of a Brahmin with a wife of his own caste or of the two lower classes, and of a Vais4ya with a Vais4ya wife only. But it quotes the opinion of others that all of them can marry a S4u1dra wife, while other authorities condemn the marriage with a S4u1dra wife in certain circumstances, which implies that in other cases it might be justified. 91) Gobhila Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 2, 42. The earlier literature bears out this impression: much stress is laid on descent from a R2s2i, and on purity of descent; 92) See Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 6, 1, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vii. 46; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 4, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 4, 19; xii. 4, 4, 6; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxv. 3, 17; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 1, 7; Kaus4ika Su1tra, 67, etc. So one of the characteristics of a Bra1hman2a given in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 7, 1, is bra1hman2ya, which Weber, op. cit., 10, 69, takes as referring to descent. Brahma-putra is a title of honour, S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 4, 1, 2. 9; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ii. 18, 12; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xii. 21, 1. 2; and to be born the son of a wise Bra1hman2a is the highest fortune, Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 29. but there is other evidence for the view that even a Bra1hman2a need not be of pure lineage. Kavas2a Ailu1s2a is taunted with being the son of a Da1si1, ‘slave woman,’ 93) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 19, 1; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xii. 3. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 2, 311; 9, 42, 44, 46. and Vatsa was accused of being a S4u1dra1's son, but established his purity by walking unhurt through the flames of a fire ordeal. 94) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 6. 6. He who is learned (s4us4ruva1n) is said to be a Bra1hman2a, descended from a R2s2i (a1rs2eya), in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1; 95) vi. 6, 1, 4. and Satyaka1ma, son of Jaba1la1, was accepted as a pupil by Ha1ridrumata Gautama, though he could not name his father. 96) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 4; Weber, op. cit., 1, 263. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 4, 1. The Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 97) xxx. 1. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 3, 462. says that knowledge is all-important, not descent. But all this merely goes to show that there was a measure of laxity in the hereditary character of caste, not that it was not based on heredity. The Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 98) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 19, 3. 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, As4vamedha, iv. 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 30. 31. The word Arya here must refer in all probability to any A1ryan, not merely to a Vais4ya, Weber, op. cit., 10, 6. recognize the illicit union of A1rya and S4u1dra1, and vice versa: it is not unlikely that if illicit unions took place, legal marriage was quite possible. The Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 99) xiv. 11, 17; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 56, n. But there is no mention here of Us4ij being a slave. indeed, recognizes such a case in that of Di1rghatamas, son of the slave girl Us4ij, if we may adopt the description of Us4ij given in the Br2haddevata1. 100) iv. 24. 25. In a hymn of the Atharvaveda 101) v. 17, 8. 9. See Muir, 12, 282, n. 76; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 249. The exact sense is not clear, but the passage is intended to show in the strongest light the high position of the Bra1hman2a. extreme claims are put forward for the Bra1hman2a, who alone is a true husband and the real husband, even if the woman has had others, a Ra1janya or a Vais4ya: a S4u1dra husband is not mentioned, probably on purpose. 102) The sense of v. 17, 18, is obscure; it can be interpreted to mean that the Bra1hman2a should be provided with a temporary wife on each occasion when he pays a visit (cf. Whitney, 250). But this is hardly likely. Muir takes it as referring to his own wife. The marriage of Bra1hman2as with Ra1janya women is illustrated by the cases of Sukanya1, daughter of king S4arya1ta, who married Cyavana, 103) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 244, 245; Weber, op. cit., 10, 73 et seq.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 352, 353. and of Rathavi1ti's daughter, who married S4ya1va1s4va. 104) Cf. Br2haddevata1, v. 50 et seq. 4. Occupation and Caste.--The Greek authorities 105) Arrian, Indica, xii. 8. 9; Strabo, xv. 4, 49. and the evidence of the Ja1takas 106) Fick, op. cit., 40 et seq. concur in showing it to have been the general rule that each caste was confined to its own occupations, but that the Bra1hman2as did engage in many professions beside that of simple priest, while all castes gave members to the S4raman2as, or homeless ascetics. The Ja1takas 107) Rhys Davids, op. cit., 54 et seq. recognize the Brahmins as engaged in all sorts of occupations, as merchants, traders, agriculturists, and so forth. Matters are somewhat simpler in Vedic literature, where the Bra1hman2as and Ks2atriyas appear as practically confined to their own professions of sacrifice and military or administrative functions. Ludwig 108) Op. cit., 3, 237 et seq. sees in Di1rghas4ravas in the Rigveda 109) i. 112, 11. a Brahmin reduced by indigence to acting as a merchant, as allowed even later by the Su1tra literature; but this is not certain, though it is perfectly possible. More interesting is the question how far the Ks2atriyas practised the duties of priests; the evidence here is conflicting. The best known case is, of course, that of Vis4va1mitra. In the Rigveda he appears merely as a priest who is attached to the court of Suda1s, king of the Tr2tsus; but in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 110) xxi. 12, 2. See Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54. he is called a king, a descendant of Jahnu, and the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 111) vii. 18, 9. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 21, where the reading is different, but worse. But see Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 16. refers to S4unah2s4epa's succeeding, through his adoption by Vis4va1mitra, to the divine lore (daiva veda) of the Ga1thins and the lordship of the Jahnus. That in fact this tradition is correct seems most improbable, but it serves at least to illustrate the existence of seers of royal origin. Such figures appear more than once in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 112) xii. 12, 6; xviii. 10, 5. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 235, n. 3. which knows the technical terms Ra1janyars2i and Devara1jan corresponding to the later Ra1jars2i, ‘royal sage.’ The Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a 113) P. 562 of the manuscript, cited by Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 154, n. says of one who knows a certain doctrine, ‘being a king he becomes a seer’ (ra1ja1 sann r2s2ir bhavati), and the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 114) i. 4, 2. Cf. Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17, 6, where Vis4va1mitra is addressed as Ra1japutra. applies the term Ra1janya to a Bra1hman2a. Again, it is argued that Deva1pi A1rs2t2is2en2a, who acted as Purohita, according to the Rigveda, 115) x. 98. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 196; Senart, Les Castes dans l'Inde, 165; Muir, 12, 269 et seq. for S4antanu, was a prince, as Ya1ska 116) Nirukta, ii. 10. says or implies he was. 117) It may be added that a family of A1rs2t2is2en2as appear as ritual authorities in a scholium on Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 9, 3; Weber, op. cit., 10. 95. But this assumption seems to be only an error of Ya1ska's. Since nothing in the Rigveda alludes to any relationship, it is impossible to accept Sieg's view 118) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 142. that the Rigveda recognizes the two as brothers, but presents the fact of a prince acting the part of Purohita as unusual and requiring explanation. The principle, however, thus accepted by Sieg as to princes in the Rigveda seems sound enough. Again, Muir 119) Op. cit., 12, 265 et seq. has argued that Hindu tradition, as shown in Sa1yan2a, 120) On Rv. i. 100; iv. 42. 43. 44; v. 27; vi. 15; x. 9. 75. 133. 134. 148. 179, etc. regards many hymns of the Rigveda as composed by royal personages, but he admits that in many cases the ascription is wrong; it may be added that in the case of Pr2thi1 Vainya, where the hymn 121) x. 148, 5. ascribed to him seems to be his, it is not shown in the hymn itself that he is other than a seer; the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 122) v. 3, 5, 4. calls him a king, but that is probably of no more value than the later tradition as to Vis4va1mitra. The case of Vis4vantara and the S4ya1parn2as mentioned in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 123) vii. 27 et seq. has been cited 124) Zimmer, op. cit., 196. as that of a king sacrificing without priestly aid, but the interpretation is quite uncertain, while the parallel of the Kas4yapas, Asitamr2gas, and Bhu1tavi1ras mentioned in the course of the narrative renders it highly probable that the king had other priests to carry out the sacrifice. Somewhat different are a series of other cases found in the Upanis2ads, where the Brahma doctrine is ascribed to royal persons. Thus Janaka is said in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 125) xi. 6, 2, 10; Muir, 12, 426-430. to have become a Brahman; Aja1tas4atru taught Ga1rgya Ba1la1ki; 126) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 1; Kaus2itaki Upanis2ad, iv. 1. Prava1han2a Jaivali instructed S4vetaketu A1run2eya, 127) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 1 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 2, 1 Ka1n2va); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 3, 1. as well as S4ilaka S4a1la1vatya 128) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 8, 1. and Caikita1yana Da1lbhya; and As4vapati Kaikeya taught Brahmins. 129) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 1, 2. It has been deduced 130) Deussen, Allgemcine Geschichte der Philosophie, 1, 2, 354; Philosophy of the Upanishads, 17 et seq.; Garbe, Beitra7ge zur indischen Kulturgeschichte, 1 et seq.; Philosophy of Ancient India, 73 et seq.; Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 602 et seq.; Winternitz. Geschichte der indischen Litteratur, 1, 256 et seq. from such passages that the Brahma doctrine was a product of the Ks2atriyas. This conclusion is, however, entirely doubtful, 131) Bloomfield, Religion of the Veda, 218 et seq.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 838, 868, 1142; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 50, 51, 257; Oldenberg. Buddha,^5 73, n. 1. for kings were naturally willing to be flattered by the ascription to them of philosophic activity, and elsewhere 132) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 1, 4, 10. the opinion of a Ra1janya is treated with contempt. It is probably a fair deduction that the royal caste did not much concern itself with the sacred lore of the priests, though it is not unlikely that individual exceptions occurred. But that warriors became priests, that an actual change of caste took place, is quite unproved by a single genuine example. That it was impossible we cannot say, but it seems not to have taken place. To be distinguished from a caste change, as Fick 133) Op. cit., 44, n. 1. points out, is the fact that a member of any caste could, in the later period at least, become a S4raman2a, as is recorded in effect of many kings in the Epic. 134) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 179 et seq., who treats this as a change of caste. Whether the practice is Vedic is not clear: Ya1ska 135) Nirukta, ii. 10. He went to the forest and practised asceticism, which is not necessarily a change of caste. records it of Deva1pi, but this is not evidence for times much anterior to the rise of Buddhism. On the other hand, the Brahmins, or at least the Purohitas, accompanied the princes in battle, and probably, like the mediæval clergy, were not unprepared to fight, 136) See Rv. iii. 53, 12. 13; i. 129, 4; 152, 7; 157, 2; vii. 83, 4; x. 38; 103, etc; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 220-226; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 135, n. 3. as Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra seem to have done, and as priests do even in the Epic from time to time. 137) Hopkins, op. cit., 13, 184. But a priest cannot be said to change caste by acting in this way. More generally the possibility of the occurrence of change of caste may be seen in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 138) x. 4, 1, 10. where S4ya1parn2a Sa1yaka1yana is represented as speaking of his offspring as if they could have become the nobles, priests, and commons of the S4alvas; and in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 139) vii. 29. where Vis4vantara is told that if the wrong offering were made his children would be of the three other castes. A drunken R2s2i of the Rigveda 140) iii. 43, 5. talks as if he could be converted into a king. On the other hand, certain kings, such as Para A1t2n2a1ra, are spoken of as performers of Sattras, ‘sacrificial sessions.’ 141) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 16, 3. Cf. for their share in the piling of the sacrificial altar, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 5, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxii. 3 (Indische Studien, 3, 473); Weber, op. cit., 10. 25. As evidence for caste exchange all this amounts to little; later a Brahmin might become a king, while the R2s2i in the Rigveda is represented as speaking in a state of intoxication; the great kings could be called sacrificers if, for the nonce, they were consecrated (di1ks2ita), and so temporarily became Brahmins. 142) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 1, 13; Weber, op. cit., 10, 17, and cf. the case of Janaka, S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 2, 1 et seq. The hypothetical passages, too, do not help much. It would be unwise to deny the possibility of caste exchange, but it is not clearly indicated by any record. Even cases like that of Satyaka1ma Ja1ba1la do not go far; for ex hypothesi that teacher did not know who his father was, and the latter could quite well have been a Brahmin. It may therefore be held that the priests and the nobles practised hereditary occupations, and that either class was a closed body into which a man must be born. These two Varn2as may thus be fairly regarded as castes. The Vais4yas offer more difficulty, for they practised a great variety of occupations (see Vais4ya). Fick 143) Op. cit., 19 et seq.; 162 et seq. concludes that there is no exact sense in which they can be called a caste, since, in the Buddhist literature, they were divided into various groups, which themselves practised endogamy such as the gahapatis, or smaller landowners, the setthis, or large merchants and members of the various guilds, while there are clear traces 144) Hopkins, The Mutual Relations of the Four Castes according to the Ma1navadharmas4a1stram, 78, 82 et seq. in the legal textbooks of a view that Bra1hman2a and Ks2atriya stand opposed to all the other members of the community. But we need hardly accept this view for Vedic times, when the Vais4ya, the ordinary freeman of the tribe, formed a class or caste in all probability, which was severed by its free status from the S4u1dras, and which was severed by its lack of priestly or noble blood from the two higher classes in the state. It is probably legitimate to hold that any Vais4ya could marry any member of the caste, and that the later divisions within the category of Vais4yas are growths of divisions parallel with the original process by which priest and noble had grown into separate entities. The process can be seen to day when new tribes fall under the caste system: each class tries to elevate itself in the social scale by refusing to intermarry with inferior classes on equal terms--hypergamy is often allowed--and so those Vais4yas who acquired wealth in trade (S4res2t2hin) or agriculture (the Pa1li Gahapatis) would become distinct, as sub-castes, from the ordinary Vais4yas. But it is not legitimate to regard Vais4ya as a theoretic caste; rather it is an old caste which is in process of dividing into innumerable sub-castes under influences of occupation, religion, or geographical situation. Fick 145) Op. cit., 202 et seq. denies also that the S4u1dras ever formed a single caste: he regards the term as covering the numerous inferior races and tribes defeated by the A1ryan invaders, but originally as denoting only one special tribe. It is reasonable to suppose that S4u1dra was the name given by the Vedic Indians to the nations opposing them, and that these ranked as slaves beside the three castes--nobles, priests, and people--just as in the Anglo-Saxon and early German constitution beside the priests, the nobiles or eorls, and the ingenui, ordinary freemen or ceorls, there was a distinct class of slaves proper; the use of a generic expression to cover them seems natural, whatever its origin (see S4u1dra). In the A1ryan view a marriage of S4u1dras could hardly be regulated by rules; any S4u1dra could wed another, if such a marriage could be called a marriage at all, for a slave cannot in early law be deemed to be capable of marriage proper. But what applied in the early Vedic period became no doubt less and less applicable later when many aboriginal tribes and princes must have come into the A1ryan community by peaceful means, or by conquest, without loss of personal liberty, and when the term S4u1dra would cover many sorts of people who were not really slaves, but were freemen of a humble character occupied in such functions as supplying the numerous needs of the village, like the Can2d2a1las, or tribes living under A1ryan control, or independent, such as the Nis2a1das. But it is also probable that the S4u1dras came to include men of A1ryan race, and that the Vedic period saw the degradation of A1ryans to a lower social status. This seems, at any rate, to have been the case with the Rathaka1ras. In the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 146) i. 1, 4, 8. the Rathaka1ra is placed as a special class along with the Bra1hman2as, Ra1janyas, and Vais4yas: this can hardly be interpreted except to mean that the Rathaka1ras were not included in the A1ryan classes, though it is just possible that only a subdivision of the Vais4yas is meant. There is other evidence 147) Cf. Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 1, 9, with the scholiast; iv. 7, 7; 9, 5; Weber, op. cit., 10, 12, 13. that the Rathaka1ras were regarded as S4u1dras. But in the Atharvaveda 148) Av. iv. 5, 6. That the words karma1ra and rathaka1ra are here appellatives, as Weber, op. cit., 17, 198. suggests, is quite impossible. the Rathaka1ras and the Karma1ras appear in a position of importance in connexion with the selection of the king; these two classes are also referred to in an honourable way in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1; 149) xxx. 6. 7. Cf. xiv. 27; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 2, 1 (Rathaka1ra); 3, 1 (Karma1ra). in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 150) xiii. 4, 2, 17. too, the Rathaka1ra is mentioned as a a person of high standing. It is impossible to accept the view suggested by Fick 151) Op. cit., 209, 210. that these classes were originally nonA1ryan; we must recognize that the Rathaka1ras, in early Vedic times esteemed for their skill, later became degraded because of the growth of the feeling that manual labour was not dignified. The development of this idea was a departure from the A1ryan conception; it is not unnatural, however undesirable, and has a faint parallel in the class distinctions of modern Europe. Similarly, the Karma1ra, the Taks2an, 152) The name is applied to Br2bu (Rv. vi. 45, 31) in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 11, 11. According to Brunnhofer, Iran und Turan, 127, the name is a people's name, but this is very unlikely. See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 107. the Carmamna, or ‘tanner,’ the weaver and others, quite dignified occupations in the Rigveda, are reckoned as S4u1dras in the Pa1li texts. 153) Fick, op. cit., 160, 210. The later theory, which appears fully developed in the Dharma Su1tras, 154) Gautama Dharma Su1tra, iv; Va1sis2t2ha Dharma Su1tra, xviii; Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, i. 16. 17. deduces the several castes other than the original four from the intermarriage of the several castes. This theory has no justification in the early Vedic literature. In some cases it is obviously wrong; for example, the Su1ta is said to be a caste of this kind, whereas it is perfectly clear that if the Su1tas did form a caste, it was one ultimately due to occupation. But there is no evidence at all that the Su1tas, Gra1man2i1s, and other members of occupations were real castes in the sense that they were endogamic in the early Vedic period. All that we can say is that there was a steady progress by which caste after caste was formed, occupation being an important determining feature, just as in modern times there are castes bearing names like Gopa1la (‘cowherd’) Kaivarta or Dhi1vara (‘fisherman’), and Van2ij (‘merchant’). 155) Cf. Jolly, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 50, 507 et seq.; Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, xxxviii, xxxix. Fick 156) Op. cit., 184 et seq. finds in the Ja1takas mention of a number of occupations whose members did not form part of any caste at all, such as the attendants on the court, the actors and dancers who went from village to village, and the wild tribes that lived in the mountains, fishermen, hunters, and so on. In Vedic times these people presumably fell under the conception of S4u1dra, and may have included the Parn2aka, Paulkasa, Bainda, who are mentioned with many others in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’). The slaves also, whom Fick 157) Ibid., 197 et seq. includes in the same category, were certainly included in the term S4u1dra. 5. Origin of the Castes.--The question of the origin of the castes presents some difficulty. The ultimate cause of the extreme rigidity of the caste system, as compared with the features of any other A1ryan society, must probably be sought in the sharp distinction drawn from the beginning between the A1ryan and the S4u1dra. The contrast which the Vedic Indians felt as existing between themselves and the conquered population, and which probably rested originally on the difference of colour between the upper and the lower classes, tended to accentuate the natural distinctions of birth, occupation, and locality which normally existed among the A1ryan Indians, but which among other A1ryan peoples never developed into a caste system like that of India. The doctrine of hypergamy which marks the practical working of the caste system, seems clearly to point to the feeling that the A1ryan could marry the S4u1dra1, but not the S4u1dra the A1rya1. This distinction probably lies at the back of all other divisions: its force may be illustrated by the peculiar state of feeling as to mixed marriages, for example, in the Southern States of America and in South Africa, or even in India itself, between the new invaders from Europe and the mingled population which now peoples the country. Marriages between persons of the white and the dark race are disapproved in principle, but varying degrees of condemnation attach to (1) the marriage of a man of the white race with a woman of the dark race; (2) an informal connexion between these two; (3) a marriage between a woman of the white race and a man of the dark race; and (4) an informal connexion between these two. Each category, on the whole, is subject to more severe reprobation than the preceding one. This race element, it would seem, is what has converted social divisions into castes. There appears, then, to be a large element of truth in the theory, best represented by Risley, 158) Best stated and summed up in The Peoples of India. See also the summary in The Indian Empire, 1, chap. 6. which explains caste in the main as a matter of blood, and which holds that the higher the caste is, the greater is the proportion of A1ryan blood. The chief rival theory is undoubtedly that of Senart, 159) Les Castes dans l'Inde. which places the greatest stress on the A1ryan constitution of the family. According to Senart the A1ryan people practised in affairs of marriage both a rule of exogamy, and one of endogamy. A man must marry a woman of equal birth, but not one of the same gens, according to Roman law as interpreted by Senart and Kovalevsky; 160) Famille et Proprie4te4 Primitives, 19, et seq. Cf. L. de la Valle4e Poussin, Le Ve4disme, 15 et seq., with Le Brahmanisme, 7. and an Athenian must marry an Athenian woman, but not one of the same . In India these rules are reproduced in the form that one must not marry within the Gotra, but not without the caste. The theory, though attractively developed, is not convincing; the Latin and Greek parallels are not even probably accurate; 161) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 472. and in India the rule forbidding marriage within the Gotra is one which grows; in strictness as the evidence grows later in date. 162) Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 74 et seq. On the other hand, it is not necessary to deny that the development of caste may have been helped by the family traditions of some gentes, or , or Gotras. The Patricians of Rome for a long time declined intermarriage with the plebeians; the Athenian Eupatridai seem to have kept their  pure from contamination by union with lower blood; and there may well have been noble families among the Vedic Indians who intermarried only among themselves. The Germans known to Tacitus 163) Germania, 7, 13, etc. were divided into nobiles and ingenui, and the Anglo-Saxons into eorls and ceorls, noble and non-noble freemen. 164) Medley, English Constitutional History,^2 21 et seq., and authorities there cited. In the formation of a kingdom minor chiefs, once petty kings, would become nobles. The origin of nobility need not be sought in the Vedic period proper, for it may already have existed. It may have been due to the fact that the king, whom we must regard as originally elected by the people, was as king often in close relation with, or regarded as an incarnation of, the deity; 165) E.g., Frazer, Early History of the Kingship and The Golden Bough (ed. 3), Part 1., The Magic Art and the Evolution of Kings. The traces of this conception in A1ryan peoples are clear--e.g., the rex sacrificulus in Rome, the sacred functions of the Archon Basileus in Athens; cf. Ridgway, Origin of Tragedy, p. 29. and that hereditary kingship would tend to increase the tradition of especially sacred blood: thus the royal family and its offshoots would be anxious to maintain the purity of their blood. In India, beside the sanctity of the king, there was the sanctity of the priest. Here we have in the family exclusiveness of king and nobles, and the similar exclusiveness of a priesthood which was not celibate, influences that make for caste, especially when accompanying the deep opposition between the general folk and the servile aborigines. Caste, once created, naturally developed in different directions. Nesfield 166) Brief View of the Caste System of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, Allahabad, 1885. was inclined to see in occupation the one ground of caste. It is hardly necessary seriously to criticize this view considered as an ultimate explanation of caste, but it is perfectly certain that gilds of workers tend to become castes. The carpenters (Taks2an), the chariot-makers (Rathaka1ra), the fishermen (Dhaivara) and others are clearly of the type of caste, and the number extends itself as time goes on. But this is not to say that caste is founded on occupation pure and simple in its first origin, or that mere difference of occupation would have produced the system of caste without the interposition of the fundamental difference between A1ryan and Da1sa or S4u1dra blood and colour. This difference rendered increasingly important what the history of the A1ryan peoples shows us to be declining, the distinction between the noble and the non-noble freemen, a distinction not of course ultimate, but one which seems to have been developed in the A1ryan people before the separation of its various branches. It is well known that the Iranian polity presents a division of classes comparable in some respects 167) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 243, 244. with the Indian polity. The priests (Atharvas) and warriors (Rathaesthas) are unmistakably parallel, and the two lower classes seem to correspond closely to the Pa1li Gahapatis, and perhaps to the S4u1dras. 168) Senart, op. cit., 141. But they are certainly not castes in the Indian sense of the word. There is no probability in the view of Senart 169) Ibid. 140. or of Risley 170) Indian Empire, 1, 336-348. that the names of the old classes were later superimposed artificially on a system of castes that were different from them in origin. We cannot say that the castes existed before the classes, and that the classes were borrowed by India from Iran, as Risley maintains, ignoring the early Bra1hman2a evidence for the four Varn2as, and treating the transfer as late. Nor can we say with Senart that the castes and classes are of independent origin. If there had been no Varn2a, caste might never have arisen; both colour and class occupation are needed for a plausible account of the rise of caste. 171) The Indian theories of the origin of caste are merely religious or philosophical, and have no value. See for them, Rv. x. 90 (which is repeated in other Sam2hita1s); Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 1, 4 et seq.; ibid., iv. 3, 10, 1-3 = Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 5 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 28-30; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 4, 3, 1 et seq. For the origin of the Brahmins, see Av. iv. 6, 1; xv. 9, 1; of the Ra1janya, Av. xv. 8, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 13, 1 et seq.; Muir, 12, 8 et seq.; Zimmer, op. cit., 217-220. The most important collection of texts on caste are those of Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, and of Weber, Indische Studien, 10, where practically all the data of the Bra1hman2as are extracted; there have to be added only the data of the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, which are merely confirmatory of those of the Taittiri1ya and Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1s, The Epic materials concerning caste are given by Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, who has also analyzed the caste relations of the Ma1navadharmas4a1stra in The Mutual Relation of the Four Castes according to the Ma1navadharmas4a1stram. Cf. also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 212 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 185 et seq.; Senart, Les Castes dans l'Inde; Barth, Revue de l'Histoire des Religions, 1894, 75 et seq.; Jolly, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 50, 507 et seq.; Oldenberg, ibid., 51, 267-290, a valuable criticism of Senart's views; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 152 et seq.; 425 et seq.; Schlagintweit, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 33, 549; Shridhar V. Katkar, History of Caste in India. The Ja1taka evidence is all collected by Fick, Die sociale Gliederung im nordo7stlichen Indien zu Buddha's Zeit (1897); its value is considerable, but its date is extremely doubtful, and it certainly cannot be regarded as really contemporary with Buddha (fifth century B.C.). The Dharma Su1tras also give full details, but the¤ir date likewise is uncertain.

That by the name Vasis2t2ha a definite individual is always meant is most improbable, as Oldenberg 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 204 et seq. Cf. vii. 23, 1 (singular) with verse 6 (plural). shows; Vasis2t2ha must normally mean simply ‘a Vasis2t2ha.’ But it is not necessary to deny that a real Vasis2t2ha existed, for one hymn 4) Rv. vii. 18. As to vii. 33, Oldenberg and Geldner differ. See Vedische Studien, 2, 130. But it is rather doubtful whether it can possibly be said to be as early as vii. 18, or to have any claim to be really an utterance of Vasis2t2ha. seems to show clear traces of his authorship, and of his assistance to Suda1s against the ten kings. The most important feature of Vasis2t2ha's life was apparently his hostility to Vis4va1mitra. The latter was certainly 5) See Rv. iii. 33. 53; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 328 et seq. at one time the Purohita (‘domestic priest’) of Suda1s, but he seems to have been deposed from that post, to have joined Suda1s' enemies, and to have taken part in the onslaught of the kings against him, for the hymn of Suda1s' triumph 4) Rv. vii. 18. As to vii. 33, Oldenberg and Geldner differ. See Vedische Studien, 2, 130. But it is rather doubtful whether it can possibly be said to be as early as vii. 18, or to have any claim to be really an utterance of Vasis2t2ha. has clear references to the ruin Vis4va1mitra brought on his allies. 6) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260 et seq. Oldenberg, 7) Op. cit., 204, n. 3. however, holds that the strife of Vis4va1mitra and Vasis2t2ha is not to be found in the Rigveda. On the other hand, Geldner 8) Op. cit., 2, 158 et seq. is hardly right in finding in the Rigveda 9) iii. 53, 15. 16. 21-24, the last four verses being the famous Vasis2t2hadves2in2yah2, which Durga, the commentator on the Nirukta, declines to explain, because he was a Ka1pis2t2hala Va1sis2t2ha (see Muir, op. cit., 12, 344; Br2haddevata1, iv. 117 et seq., with Macdonell's notes). What the verses really mean is not at all certain. See Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 254 et seq. a compressed account indicating the rivalry of S4akti, Vasis2t2ha's son, with Vis4va1mitra, the acquisition by Vis4va1mitra of special skill in speech, and the revenge of Vis4va1mitra, who secured the death of S4akti by Suda1s' servants, an account which is more fully related by S2ad2gurus4is2ya, 10) Cf. Sa1yan2a on Rv. vii. 32, and Macdonell's edition of the Sarva1nukraman2i1, 107; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 119. which appeared in the S4a1t2ya1yanaka, 11) See the note in the Anukraman2i1 on vii. 32, where both the Ta1n2d2aka and the S4a1t2ya1yanaka are quoted (Muir, op. cit., 12, 328). and to which reference seems to be made in the brief notices of the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 12) vii. 4, 7, 1. In iii. 1, 7, 3; v. 4, 11, 3, also Vasis2t2ha is a foe of Vis4va1mitra. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 13) iv. 7, 3; viii. 2, 3; xix. 3, 8; xxi. 11, 2. The story is alluded to in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iv. 8, and in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 150; iii. 26. 83. 149. 204. In ii. 390 it is definitely stated, as in the S4a1t2ya1yanaka (n. 10), that S4akti was cast into the fire by the Sauda1sas. regarding Vasis2t2ha's sons having been slain, and his overcoming the Sauda1sas. But it is important to note that no mention is made in these authorities of Suda1s himself being actually opposed to Vasis2t2ha, while in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 14) vii. 34, 9; viii. 21, 11. Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 11, 14. Vasis2t2ha appears as the Purohita and consecrator of Suda1s Paijavana. Ya1ska 15) Nirukta, ii. 24; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxvi. 12, 13. recognizes Vis4va1mitra as the Purohita of Suda1s; this accords with what seems to have been the fact that Vis4va1mitra originally held the post. Probably, however, with the disappearance of Suda1s, Vis4va1mitra recovered his position, whereupon Vasis2t2ha in revenge for the murder of his sons secured in some way unspecified the defeat of the Sauda1sas. 16) Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 121 et seq., considered that the Vasis2t2has were finally successful in the effort to remove the Vis4va1mitras from favour. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 120; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 34, doubted this, and Muir, op. cit., 12, 371-375, held the problem to be insoluble. Roth and Muir, however, both complicated the question by regarding the Bharatas as enemies of the Tr2tsus, which (see Tr2tsu) is not at all probable, though it is still the view of Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 41, 42. At any rate it is hardly necessary to suppose that the enmity of the Sauda1sas and Vasis2t2has was permanent. There is evidence 17) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xv. 4, 24; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 34. that the Bharatas had the Vasis2t2has as Purohitas, while other versions 18) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 2, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 17. regard them as Purohitas for people (praja1h2) generally. It seems that the Vasis2t2has were pioneers in adopting the rule that Purohitas should act as Brahman priest 19) Vasis2t2ha was Brahman at the sacrifice of S4unah2s4epa, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 16; S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xv. 21, 4. at the sacrifice: the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 20) xii. 6, 1, 41. Cf. iv. 6, 6, 5. states that the Vasis2t2has were once the only priests to act as Brahmans, but that later any priest could serve as such. 21) S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, i. 5; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 35. A rivalry with Jamadgni and Vis4va1mitra is reported in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 22) iii. 1, 7, 3. Cf. n. 11. Para1s4ara and S4ataya1tu are associated with Vasis2t2ha in the Rigveda, 23) vii. 18, 21. being apparently, as Geldner 24) Vedische Studien, 2, 132. thinks, the grandson and a son of Vasis2t2ha. According to Pischel, 25) Vedische Studien, 2, 55 et seq. in another hymn, 26) vii. 55. Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 337, took the hymn to refer to a lover's visit to a maiden. Cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 370; Br2haddevata1, vi. 11, with Macdonell's notes. Vasis2t2ha appears as attempting to steal the goods of his father Varun2a; Geldner 27) Vedische Studien, 2, 138. So also Nirukta, v. 13; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 231, n. 97; Br2haddevata1, v. 150. 151. also shows that the Rigveda 28) vii. 33, 11. contains a clear reference to Vasis2t2ha's being a son of Varun2a and the nymph Urvas4i1. Perhaps this explains the fact that the Vasis2t2has are called the Tr2tsus in one passage of the Rigveda; 29) vii. 83, 8. for being of miraculous parentage, Vasis2t2ha would need adoption into a Gotra, that of the princes whom he served, and to whom Agastya seems to have introduced him. There are numerous other references to Vasis2t2ha as a R2s2i in Vedic literature, 30) Rv. i. 112, 9; vii. 88, 4; 96, 3; x. 95, 17; 181, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 19; xx. 9; xxxii. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 478); Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 12; ii. 7, 9; iv. 2, 9; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 10, 5; Av. iv. 29, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 18, 3; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxvi. 14; xxix. 2. 3; xxx. 3; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 13; 15, 2; 18, 6; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 2, 2; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 2, 4, etc. in the Su1tras, 31) See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 89-92; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 35. and in the Epic, where he and Vis4va1mitra fight out their rivalry. 32) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 375-414.

वस्न
वस्न
 in the Rigveda 1) iv. 24, 9. where the phrase bhu1yasa1 vasnam acarat kani1yah2 must mean ‘with a greater price he obtained a lesser value.’ For the exact sense, cf. Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 419, 420. and later 2) Av. xii. 2, 36 (‘price’) = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 49 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 4, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 2, where the sense seems to be ‘let us barter food and drink like wares.’ Cf. also vasnika1, ‘worth a price,’ in Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 3, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 247; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 382. denotes the ‘price’ paid for anything or its ‘value,’ or the thing itself as an object of purchase, ‘ware.’

वहतु
वहतु
 is the regular name in the Rigveda 1) i. 184, 3; iv. 58, 9; x. 17, 1 (= Av. iii. 31, 5); 32, 3; 85, 13 et seq. and later 2) Av. x. 1, 1; xiv. 2, 9, 12, 66, 73; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 7, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 1, 2. for the ceremonial conducting of the bride from the house of her parents to that of her husband.

वाकोवाक्य
वाको-वाक्य,
 ‘dialogue,’ is the name given in the Bra1hman2as 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 6, 9, 20; xi. 5, 6, 8; 7, 5; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. to certain portions of the Vedic texts. In one place 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 6, 9, 20. the Brahmodya is said to be a dialogue; very probably in all the passages the Brahmodya is meant by this term. Geldner's view 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 291. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 267; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 98, n. 3. It is certain that ‘logic’ is not meant, though Max Mu7ller so renders it in his translation of the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. is different: he sees in the Va1kova1kya an essential part of the Itiha1sa-Pura1n2a, the dialogue or dramatic element as opposed to the narrative portion.

वाच्
वाच्,
 ‘speech,’ plays a great part in Vedic speculation, but only a few points are of other than mythological significance. Speech is in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) iv. 1, 3, 16. There are quite different accounts in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiv. 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 11, 5. Oldenberg finds traces of the origin of the legend in Rv. viii. 100; but see v. Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 339 et seq.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1911, 993 et seq. divided into four kinds -that of men, of animals, of birds (vaya1m2si), and of small creeping things (ks2udram2 sari1sr2pam). The discrimination or making articulate of speech is ascribed to Indra by the Sam2hita1s. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 7, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 8. The ‘speech’ of the following musical instruments -Tu1n2ava, Vi1n2a1, Dundubhi 3) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 5, 1013; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 4, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 6, 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 4. --is mentioned, and in one Sam2hita1 4) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. also that of the axle of a chariot. The speech of the Kuru-Pan5ca1las was especially renowned, 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 3, 15. The difficult phrase has caused some doubt as to the sense, for uttara1hi va1g vadati Kurupan5ca1latra1 seems to mean ‘speech in the north among the KuruPan5ca1las,’ this version being slightly supported by the Ka1n2va recension of the passage quoted by Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xlii. n. 1. That recension, however, is not merely obscure, but it seems to couple the Kurus with the northern Maha1vr2s2as (so we must emend Maha1vis2es2u), and it cannot be relied on. Eggeling's attempt to remove the difficulty by taking uttara1hi as ‘higher’ in tone is not satisfactory. The most probable solution is that of Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 191, who takes Kurupan5ca1latra1 to be ‘as among the Kuru-Pan5ca1las,’ which gives a good sense, especially when it is remembered that the northerners were probably the Uttara-Kurus in Kas4mi1r, which seems to have been a home of Sanskrit (cf. Franke, Pa1li und Sanskrit, 89). as well as that of the northern country, according to the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, 6) vii. 6. so that men went there to study the language. On the other hand, barbarisms in speech were known, and were to be avoided. 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 1, 23. 24, where the Asuras are described as saying he 'lavah2, perhaps for he 'rayah2 But the Ka1n2va version is different See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East 26, 31, n. 3. One division of speech referred to 8) See Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiv. 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 11, 5 (where the words yas4 ca veda vas4 ca na replace the ordinary distinction of daivi1 and ma1nus2i1: perhaps vedo should be read); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 2, 1, 34; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 18, 13; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 3, 1; a Bra1hman2a in Nirukta, xiii. 9, etc. is that of the divine (daivi1) and the human (ma1nus2i1), of which some specimens are given, such as om, the divine counterpart of tatha1, and so forth. The Brahmin is said to know both; 9) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, loc. cit.; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, loc. cit., etc. it seems best to regard the distinction not as between Sanskrit and Apabhram2s4a, as Sa1yan2a 10) See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 200, n. suggests, but as between the Sanskrit of the ritual and the hymns and that of ordinary life. Reference is also made to A1ryan 11) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 5; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 9. and to Brahmin 12) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, i. 5, 2. speech, by which Sanskrit, as opposed to non-A1ryan tongues, seems to be meant. The Vra1tyas are described as speaking the language of the initiated (di1ks2ita-va1c), though not themselves initiated (a-di1ks2ita), but as calling that which is easy to utter (a-durukta), difficult to utter. 13) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 1, 9. Cf. Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 34, 35; Weber, Indian Literature, 175-180; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 179, 180; 196. This may mean that the non-Brahminical Indians were advancing more rapidly than the Brahminical tribes to Pra1krit speech, especially if it is legitimate to connect the Vra1tyas with the barbarians in speech alluded to in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 1, 23. 24, where the Asuras are described as saying he 'lavah2, perhaps for he 'rayah2 But the Ka1n2va version is different See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East 26, 31, n. 3.

 ‘descendant of Vacaknu,’ is the patronymic of a woman with the further patronymic of Ga1rgi1, who appears as a student of Brahman in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) iii. 6, 1; 8, 1. Cf. A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 4, 4; S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iv. 10; Atharvaveda Parisis2t2a, xliii. 4, 23.

वाज
वाज
 from the meaning of ‘strength,’ ‘speed,’ in its application to horses derives the sense of ‘race’ 1) Rv. ii. 23, 13; iii. 11, 9; 37, 6; 42, 6; v. 35, 1; 86, 2, etc. and ‘prize,’ 2) Rv. i. 64, 13; ii. 26, 3; 31, 7; iii. 2, 3; viii. 103, 5, etc. or merely ‘prosperity.’ 3) Rv. i. 27, 5; 92, 7; vi. 45, 21. 23, etc.; Av. xiii. 1, 22; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xviii. 7, 1. 12. That it ever means ‘horse’ is most improbable, that sense being given by Va1jin. 4) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 10 et seq., where he explains otherwise all the passages cited for the sense by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 8.

वाजपेय
वाजपेय
 is the name of a ceremony which, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) v. 1, 5, 2. 3. and later authorities, 2) See Weber, U7ber den Ra1jasu1ya; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 147 et seq. is only performed by a Brahmin or a Ks2atriya. The same Bra1hman2a 3) v. 1, 1, 13; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 1, 1, 2. insists that this sacrifice is superior to the Ra1jasu1ya, but the consensus of other authorities 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 2, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 6, 1; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 9, 19; La1t2ya1yana Srauta Su1tra, viii. 11, 1, etc. assigns to it merely the place of a preliminary to the Br2haspatisava in the case of a priest, and to the Ra1jasu1ya in the case of a king, while the S4atapatha 5) v. 2, 1, 2. Cf. Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, xiv. 1, 2. is compelled to identify the Br2haspatisava with the Va1japeya. The essential ceremony is a chariot race in which the sacrificer is victorious. There is evidence in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 6) xv. 1. See Weber, op. cit., 41 et seq. showing that once the festival was one which any A1ryan could perform. Hillebrandt, 7) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 247. indeed, goes so far as to compare it with the Olympic games; but there is hardly much real ground for this: the rite seems to have been developed round a primitive habit of chariot racing, transformed into a ceremony which by sympathetic magic secures the success of the sacrificer. In fact 8) Sacred Books of the East, 41, xxiv, xxv. Eggeling seems correct in holding that the Va1japeya was a preliminary rite performed by a Brahmin prior to his formal installation as a Purohita, or by a king prior to his consecration. The Kuru Va1japeya was specially well known. 9) Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xv. 3, 14 et seq.; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, xviii. 3, 7.

In one passage 2) x. 56, 2. it is perhaps, as Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133. thinks, a proper name, that of a son of Br2haduktha, but this view seems forced.

Sieg 7) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 76 et seq. has endeavoured to trace these tales in the Rigveda, 8) Rv iv. 27 and iv. 24 respectively. On the former hymn, see Oldenberg, R2igveda-Noten, 1, 291 et seq.; on the latter, ibid., 419 et seq. but without any success.

वासःपल्पूली
वासः-पल्पूली,
 ‘washer of clothes,’ is the name of one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 12; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 7, 1.

वासस्
वासस्
 is the most usual word in the Rigveda 1) i. 34, 1; 115, 4; 162, 16; viii. 3, 24; x. 26, 6; 102, 2, etc. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 9, 7; 11, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 32; xi. 40; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, etc. A garment of Kus4a grass is mentioned in S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 1, 8, as worn by the wife of the sacrificer at the consecration, but it is doubtful whether such dresses were normally worn. Cf. also kausumbha-paridha1na, ‘a silken garment,’ S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xi. 4. for ‘clothing.’ Clothes were often woven of sheep's wool (cf. U1rn2a1); the god Pu1s2an is called a ‘weaver of garments’ (va1seva1ya) 3) Rv. x. 26, 6. because of his connexion with the fashioning of forms. The garments worn were often embroidered (cf. Pes4as), and the Maruts are described as wearing mantles adorned with gold. 4) Rv. v. 55, 6 (hiran2yaya1n atha1n). When the ‘giver of garments’ (va1so-da1) 5) Rv. x. 107, 2. Cf. vastra-da1, v. 24, 8. is mentioned along with the giver of horses and gold, ornamental garments are probably meant. There are several references in the Rigveda 6) Rv. i. 85, 1; 92, 4; ix. 96, 1, x. 1, 6. to the Indians' love of ornament, which is attested by Megas thenes for his day. 7) See Strabo, p. 709; Arrian, Indica, v. 9. The Rigveda also presents epithets like su-vasana 8) Rv. ix. 97, 50. and su-rabhi, 9) With atka, vi. 29, 3; x. 123, 7. this word may possibly indicate that early Vedic dress was fitted like the Minoan style of dress, and unlike the later Achæan style as seen in Homer (cf. Lang, The World of Homer, 60 et seq.). implying that garments were becoming or well-fitting. The Vedic Indian seems often to have worn three garments -an undergarment (cf. Ni1vi), 10) Av. viii. 2, 16; xiv. 2, 50. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 1, 3; Va1jasanevi Sam2hita1, iv. 10, etc. a garment, 11) Va1sas in the narrower sense, Av. viii. 2, 16. and an overgarment (cf. Adhi1va1sa), 12) Rv. i. 140, 9; 162, 16; x. 5, 4. which was presumably a mantle, and for which the names Atka and Dra1pi also seem to be used. This accords with the description of the sacrificial garments given in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 13) v. 3, 5, 20 et seq. See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 85 et seq. which comprise a Ta1rpya, perhaps a ‘silken undergarment’; secondly, a garment of undyed wool, and then a mantle, while the ends of the turban, after being tied behind the neck, are brought forward and tucked away in front. The last point would hardly accord with the usual practice in ordinary life, but seems to be a special sacrificial ritual act. A similar sort of garments in the case of women appears to be alluded to in the Atharvaveda 14) viii. 2, 16; xiv. 2, 50. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 15) v. 2, 1, 8. There is nothing to show exactly what differences there were between male and female costume, nor what was exactly the nature of the clothes in either case. It is important to note that the Vedic Indian evidently assumed that all civilized persons other than inspired Munis would wear clothing of some sort. 16) Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 1, 1; and iii. 1, 2, 13-17, where the fact that man alone wears clothes is accounted for by a silly legend. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 261, 262. See also Vasana, Vastra, Otu, Tantu. For the use of skin garments, see Mala.

वासिष्ठ
वासिष्ठ,
 ‘descendant of Vasis2t2ha,’ is the patronymic of Sa1tyahavya, a teacher mentioned several times in the later Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 6, 2, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 17 (Indische Studien, 3, 474); Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 9; iv. 8, 7.

 in the dual is found in three passages of the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 8, 1; vi. 110, 2; 121, 3. See also iii. 7, 4. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. sees in the term the name of two stars, while in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) iv. 4, 10, 2. he thinks they mean the Naks2atra called Mu1la. There can, however, be no doubt that the asterism is intended in all the passages. 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 356; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 361, points out that Vicr2tau are  and  Scorpionis, while Mu1la includes the tail as a whole.

वितस्ता
वितस्ता,
 the most westerly of the five rivers of the Panjab, is only mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 75, 5; Nirukta, ix. 26; cf. Ka1s4ika1 Vr2tti on Pa1n2ini, i. 4, 31. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 12; Imperial Gazetteer of India, 14, 160. in the Nadi1stuti (‘Praise of Rivers’). 2) The rareness of the name in the Rigveda points to the Panjab not having been the seat of the activity of the greater part of the Vedic Indians. It is the Hydaspes of Alexander's historians, more correctly reproduced by Ptolemy as Bidaspes. The name appears in the Mohammedan historians corrupted to Bihat or Wihat, and survives in the modern Kashmi1ri1 form of Veth.

वित्त
वित्त
 in the Rigveda 1) v. 42, 9; x. 34, 13. and later 2) Av. xii. 3, 52; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 9, 2; vi. 2, 4, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 11. 14, etc. denotes ‘wealth,’ ‘possessions.’ The earth is referred to in the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad 3) ii. 8. Cf. the name vasumati1 found in the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xiii. 1. as full of riches (vittasya pu1rn2a1). The doctrine that a man's greatness depends on his wealth is found as early as the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 4) i. 4, 7, 7. The striving after wealth (vittais2an2a1) is mentioned in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 5) iii. 4, 1; iv. 4, 26. as one of the things abandoned by the sage. 

विदग्धशाकल्य
विदग्ध शाकल्य

विदथ
विदथ
 is a word of obscure sense, confined mainly to the Rigveda. According to Roth, 1) Rv. i. 31, 6; 117, 25; iii. 1, 18; 27, 7; iv. 38, 4; vi. 8, 1; x. 85, 26; 92, 2; Av. iv. 25, 1; v. 20, 12; xviii. 3, 70, etc. the sense is primarily ‘order,’ then the concrete body which gives orders, then ‘assembly’ for secular 2) ii. 1, 4; 27, 12, 17; iii. 38, 5, 6; v. 63, 2; vii. 66, 10; viii. 39, 1; x. 12, 7; Av. xvii. 1, 15. So Whitney renders the word in Av. i. 13, 4, as ‘council,’ Translation of the Atharvaveda, 15. or religious ends, 3) Rv. i. 60, 1; ii. 4, 8; 39, 1; iii. 1, 1; 56, 8, etc. or for war. 4) Rv. i. 166, 2; 167, 6; v. 59, 2, etc. Oldenberg 5) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 26 et seq. But in Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft, 54, 609-611, he falls back on the derivation from vidh, ‘worship.’ Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 23, n. 10. once thought that the main idea is ‘ordinance’ (from vi-dha1, ‘dispose,’ ‘ordain’), and thence ‘sacrifice.’ Ludwig 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 259 et seq. thinks that the root idea is an ‘assembly,’ especially of the Maghavans and the Brahmins. Geldner 7) Vedische Studien, 1, 147; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 52, 757; Rigveda, Glossar, 161. considers that the word primarily means ‘knowledge,’ ‘wisdom,’ ‘priestly lore,’ then ‘sacrifice’ and ‘spiritual authority.’ Bloomfield, 8) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 12 et seq. on the other hand, insists that Vidatha refers to the ‘house’ 9) See Rigveda, x. 85, 26. 27 (of the wife in the marriage ritual); i. 117, 25; ii. 1, 6; Av. xviii. 3, 70. in the first place (from vid, ‘acquire’), and then to the ‘sacrifice,’ as connected with the house; this interpretation, at any rate, appears to suit all the passages. The term vidathya, once 10) iv. 27, 2. In i. 91, 20; 167, 3; Av. xx. 128, 1, vidathya, ‘having an establishment,’ seems adequate. applied to the king (samra1t2), might seem to be against this view, but it may refer to his being ‘rich in homesteads’; and the connexion of the woman with the Vidatha, as opposed to the Sabha1, tells in favour 11) Cf. Av. vii. 38, 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 7, 4. of Bloomfield's explanation. That the word ever denotes an asylum, like the house of the Brahmin, 12) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 13, with Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 3, 35. as Ludwig 13) Op. cit., 3, 261. suggests, is doubtful. 14) Rv. i. 31, 6; v. 62, 6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 30, 27, 28, certainly does not show this clearly. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 177, who suggests that Vidatha sometimes means (e.g., in vidathes2u pras4astah2, Rv. ii. 27, 12) a smaller assembly than the Samiti. But we have no ground to be certain that such smaller assemblies ever existed at an early date either in India or elsewhere among A1ryan peoples.

विदन्वन्त्भार्गव
विदन्वन्त् भार्गव
 (‘descendant of Bhr2gu’) is mentioned as the seer of a Sa1man or chant in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 11, 10. and in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 2) iii. 159 et seq. (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 64).

विदर्भ
विदर्भ
 occurs in the earlier Vedic literature as the name of a place only in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, 1) ii. 440 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 103, n. 3). where its Ma1calas (perhaps a species of dog) are said to kill tigers.

विदर्भीकौण्डिनेय
विदर्भी-कौण्डिनेय
 is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Vatsanapa1t in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Ma1dhyam2dina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Ka1n2va)

विदिश्
वि-दिश्
 denotes 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vi. 19; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iv. 4. an ‘intermediate quarter.’ See Dis4.

विदीगय
विदीगय
 is the name of an animal in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) v. 6, 22, 1. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 2) iii. 9, 9, 3; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, xx. 22, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94. The commentary on the former takes it as a kind of cock (kukkut2a-vis4es2a), that on the latter as a white heron (s4veta-baka). 

विदेघ
विदेघ
 is the name of a man, Ma1thava, in the S4atapatha Bra1hmana. 1) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. It is legitimate to assume 2) Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli, n. 4; 104, n.; Weber Indische Studien, 1, 170; Indische Streifen, 1, 13; Indian Literature, 134. that it is a name given to him as king of the Videghas who are the later Videhas.

विदेह
विदेह
 is the name of a people who are not mentioned before the Bra1hman2a period. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. the legend of Videgha Ma1thava preserves clearly a tradition that in Videha culture came from the Brahmins of the West, and that Kosala was brahminized before Videha. The Videhas, however, derived some fame later from the culture of their king Janaka, who figures in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 2) iii. 8, 2. Cf. iv. 2, 6; 9, 30; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 1, 2; 6, 2, 1; 3, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 9, 9. as one of the leading patrons of the Brahman doctrine. In the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 3) iv. 1. the Videhas are joined with the Ka1s4is; in the list of peoples in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 4) viii. 14. the Videhas are passed over, probably because, with Kosala and Ka1s4i, they are included in the term Pra1cyas, ‘easterners.’ Again, in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 5) xvi. 29. 5. it is recorded that the Ka1s4i, Kosala, and Videha kingdoms had each the one Purohita, Jala Ja1tu1karn2ya; and in another passage of the same text 6) xvi. 9, 11. 13. the connexion between the Videha king, Para A1t2n2a1ra, and the Kosala king, Hiran2yana1bha, is explained, while the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 7) xiii. 5, 4, 4. speaks of Para A1t2n2a1ra as the Kosala king, descendant of Hiran2yana1bha. Another king of Videha was Nami1 Sa1pya, mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 8) xxv. 10, 17. In the Sam2hita1s of the Yajurveda 9) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 4, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiv. 5. ‘cows of Videha’ seem to be alluded to, though the commentator on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 merely takes the adjective vaidehi1 as ‘having a splendid body’ (vis4is2t2a-deha-sambandhini1), and the point of a place name in the expression is not very obvious. The Videhas also occur in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 10) ii. 5; xxi. 13. in Bra1hman2a-like passages. The boundary of Kosala and Videha was the Sada1ni1ra1, probably the modern Gandak 11) Cf. Imperial Gaxetteer of India, 12, 125. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170; Indian Literature, 10, 33, 53, 127, 129, etc.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli; Oldenberg, Buddha, 398, 399; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 26, 37; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 19 et seq. (the Kondochates of the Greek geographers), which, rising in Nepal, flows into the Ganges opposite Patna. Videha itself corresponds roughly to the modern Tirhut.

विद्या
विद्या
 in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 116, 1; xi. 7, 10; 8, 3. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 2, 8; v. 1, 7, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 23, 8. 9, etc. denotes ‘knowledge,’ especially that of the three Vedas, which are called the trayi1 vidya1, ‘the threefold knowledge,’ as early as the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 3) iii. 10, 11, 5. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 5, 6, etc. In a more special sense Vidya1 occurs in lists of objects of study in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 4) xi. 5, 6, 8; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 4, 10; iv. 5, 11. What exactly the expression here means is uncertain: Sa1yan2a 5) On S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 6, 8. suggests the philosophic systems; Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 290, n. 4. the first Bra1hman2as; and Eggeling, 7) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 98, n. 2. more probably, special sciences like the Sarpavidya1 or the Vis2avidya1.

विद्रध
विद्रध
 denotes a disease, ‘abscesses,’ in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 127, 1; ix. 8, 20. According to Zimmer, 2) Altindisches Leben, 386. it was a symptom accompanying Yaks2ma. Later it is called Vidradhi. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 93. Cf. Roth, Nirukta, Erla7uterungen, 42, 43. compares the obscure Vidradha of the Rigveda, 4) iv. 32, 23. where, however, the sense of the word is very uncertain. 5) Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 295. Cf. Wise, System of Hindu Medicine, 210; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 531, 602; Atharvaveda, 60; Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 397; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376.

विधवा
विधवा
 denotes ‘widow’ as the ‘desolate one,’ from the root vidh, ‘be bereft.’ The masculine vidhava is conjectured by Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; so also Grassmann. in a difficult passage of the Rigveda, 2) x. 40, 8. where the received text presents the apparent false concord vidhantam2 vidhava1m, in which he sees a metrical lengthening for vidhavam, ‘the sacrificing widower.’ Ludwig in his version takes vidhantam as equivalent to a feminine, while Delbru7ck 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 443. prefers ‘the worshipper and the widow.’ Possibly ‘the widower and the widow’ may be meant; but we know nothing of the mythological allusion in question, the feat being one of those attributed to the As4vins, and the natural reference to Ghos2a1 as ‘husbandless’ being rendered unlikely because their feat in regard to her has already been mentioned a few verses before in the same hymn. 4) x. 40. 5. The word Vidhava1 is not of common occurrence. 5) Rv. iv. 18, 12; x. 40, 2; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iii. 7; Nirukta, iii. 15.

विधु
विधु
 seems clearly to mean (as it does in the post-Vedic language) the ‘moon’ in a passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 55, 5; Nirukta, xiv. 18. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 465. That the ‘many’ are the Naks2atras is neither certain nor even probable. The stars are an adequate explanation. where it is alluded to as ‘wandering solitary in the midst of many’ (vidhum2 dadra1n2am2 samane bahu1na1m).

विनशन
वि-नशन,
 ‘disappearance,’ is the name of the place where the Sarasvati1 is lost in the sands of the desert. It is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xxv. 10, 6; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxiv. 5, 30; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 15, 1; Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, i. 1, 2, 12. Cf. Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 2, 147. and the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 2) iv. 26. The locality is the Patiala district of the Panjab. 3) Cf. Imperial Gazetteer of India, 22, 97. Cf. Plaks2a Pra1sravan2a.

विप्

 in several passages of the Rigveda 1) ix. 3, 2; 65, 12; 99, 1. refers, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. to the rods which form the bottom of the Soma filter, and on which the straining cloth is stretched. But this explanation is very doubtful. 3) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 203; Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, 1, v; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellchaft, 54, 171; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 97-110.

1. Vipas4cit Dr2d2ha-jayanta Lauhitya (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 42, 1) as the pupil of Daks2a Jayanta Lauhitya.

विपश्चित्शकुनिमित्रपाराशर्य
2. Vipas4cit S4akuni-mitra Pa1ra1s4arya (‘descendant of Para1s4ara’) is the name of a teacher, pupil of As2a1d2ha Uttara Pa1ra1s4arya, in a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hmana (iii. 41, 1).

विपाश्
वि-पाश्
 (‘fetterless’) is the name of a river mentioned twice in the Rigveda. 1) iii. 33, 1. 3; iv. 30, 11. Ya1ska, Nirukta, xi. 48, sees in the latter passage an adjective vi-pa1s4in, but this is very improbable. See Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 294. It is the modern Bea1s in the Panjab, the Hyphasis, Hypanis or Bipasis of the Greeks. Its small importance for the Vedic Indians is indicated by the fact that it is never mentioned in the earlier Vedic literature except in two hymns of the Rigveda. The Nirukta 2) ix. 26. The Vipa1s4 is also mentioned in connexion with the S4utudri1 in ii. 24; ix. 36. preserves the notice that its earlier name was Urun5jira1, while the Gopatha Bra1hman2a 3) i. 2, 7. places in the middle of it the Vasis2t2ha-s4ila1h2. Pa1n2ini1 4) iv. 2, 74. mentions the name, which otherwise in post-Vedic literature appears as Vipa1s4a1. This river has changed its course considerably since ancient times. 5) See Imperiat Gazctteer of India, 7, 138 (Bea1s). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 11.

विपृथु

 in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xiv. 72, 3) is apparently equivalent to the Vipatha, ‘rough cart,’ of other texts. It is probably a mere blunder.

विप्र
 seems to mean ‘inspired singer’ (from vip, ‘quiver’) in the Rigveda 1) i. 129, 2. 11; 162, 7; iv. 26, 1, etc. Seven are spoken of in iii. 7, 7; 31. 5; iv. 2, 15, etc. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 9, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 2, 7, etc. More especially in the later texts 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 3, 12, etc. it denotes a ‘learned Brahmin.’ In the epic style it comes to mean no more than ‘Brahmin.’

विप्रजनसौराकि
विप्र-जन सौराकि
 is the form of the name of Vipu1jana given by the St. Petersburg Dictionaries for the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 1) xxvii. 5; Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 477, gives this form, which is due to a misreading of the ligature for u1.

विबाली

Hopkins 3) Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 60, n. 1. is inclined to read Vaibhinduka as a patronymic of Medha1tithi. Cf. Vibhinduki1ya.

विमद
1. Vi-mada is credited by the Anukraman2i1 (Index) with the authorship of a number of hymns of the Rigveda. 1) Rv. x. 20-26. This attribution is supported by the occurrence in this group of the name of the seer, 2) Rv. x. 20, 10; 23, 7. and once of his family, the Vimadas, 3) Rv. x. 23, 6. besides the repeated refrain 4) Rv. x. 21, 1-8; 24, 1-3. vi vo made, ‘in your carouses.’ Vimada is occasionally alluded to later. 5) Av. iv. 29, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 1. 

विमद
2. Vimada is mentioned in several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 51, 3; 112, 19; 116, 1; 117, 20; x. 39, 7; 65, 12, From viii. 9, 15, Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 105, has inferred that Vimada and Vatsa were identical. as a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, who gave him a wife, Kamadyu1. His identity with the preceding is improbable.

विमुक्ता
वि-मुक्ता
 (lit., ‘secreted’), ‘pearl,’ is found in the late S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a (v. 6).

विमोक्तृ
वि-मोक्तृ
 in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 14; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 10, 1 (cf. vimoktri1,) used metaphorically, ibid., iii. 7. 14, 1). (‘human sacrifice’) denotes one who unharnesses horses from the chariot, as opposed to Yoktr2, ‘one who yokes.’ The corresponding verbal noun Vimocana, ‘unyoking,’ is often found. 2) Rv. iii. 53, 5, 20; iv. 46, 7, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 1, 5, etc.

विराज्
वि-राज्
 as a title of royalty is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 188, 5; ix. 96, 18; x. 166, 1, etc.; Av. xii. 3, 11; xiv. 2, 15, etc. but only in a metaphorical sense. As an actual title, it is asserted in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 2) viii. 14, 3. to be used by the Uttara Kurus and the Uttara Madras.

विरूप
वि-रूप
 is the name of an An3girasa who is twice mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) i. 45, 3; viii. 75, 6. and to whom certain hymns are attributed by the Anukraman2i1 (Index). ^2 viii. 43 et seq.; 64.

विलिगी
विलिगी
 denotes a kind of snake in the Atharvaveda (v. 13, 7).

विलिष्टभेषज
विलिष्ट-भेषज
 in the Atharvaveda (Paippala1da, xx. 5, 2) denotes a remedy for a dislocation or a sprain. 

विलोहित
वि-लोहित
 is the name of a disease mentioned in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 8, 1; xii. 4, 4 Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 657. thinks that ‘flow of blood from the nose’ is meant; Henry 3) Les livres viii. et ix. de l' Atharvaveda, 105, 142. renders it ‘decomposition of the blood’; and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda 549. has ‘anæmia.’

विवध
वि-वध
 or Vi1-vadha seems to denote a yoke borne on the shoulders to enable one to carry a weight. But it is found in the Bra1hman2as used only metaphorically in such phrases as vi-vivadha, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 2, 5, 2; 7, 3; vivi1vadha, Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 19; ubhayato -vi1vadha, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvii. 10. ‘with the weight unequally distributed,’ and savi1vadhata1, 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 1, 4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 10; sa-vi1vadha-tva, v. 1, 11: xxii. 5, 7, etc. ‘equality of burden.’

विवयन
वि-वयन
 denotes in the Bra1hman2as ‘plaited work,’ such as that used in a couch (Asandi1). ^1 Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 5, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a1, xii. 8, 3, 6. In the Su1tras viva1na has the same sense; La1t2ya1yana Srauta Su1tra, iii, 12, 1, etc.

विवाह
वि-वाह,
 ‘marriage,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 1, 24; xiv. 2, 65. The Rigvedic term is Vahatu. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 2, 8, 7; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vii. 10, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv, 27, 5, and often in the Su1tras. See Pati.

विश्
विश्
 is an expression of somewhat doubtful significance. In many passages of the Rigveda 1) iv. 4, 3; 37, 1; v. 3. 5; vi. 21, 4; 48, 8; vii. 56, 22; 61, 3, 70, 3; 104, 18; x. 91, 2, etc. the sense of ‘settlement’ or ‘dwelling’ is adequate and probable, since the root vis4 means to ‘enter’ or ‘settle.’ In other passages, where the Vis4ah2 stand in relation to a prince, the term must mean ‘subject’; 2) Rv. iv. 50, 8; vi. 8, 4; x. 124, 8; 173, 6; Av. iii. 4, 1; iv. 8, 4; 22, 1. 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 8, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 46; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 2. 17; iv. 2, 1, 3; v. 3, 3, 12; 4, 2, 3; x. 6, 2, 1; xiii. 6, 2, 8; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv, 12, etc. Many of the passages cited under note 11 may also belong here, while in Av. iii. 4, 1, etc., reference to the cantons as electing a king has been seen; but see Ra1jan and cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 179; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 303; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 113. so, for example, when the people of Tr2n2askanda 3) Rv. i. 172, 3. or of the Tr2tsus are mentioned. 4) Rv. vii. 33, 6; Geldner, op. cit., 136. Again, in some passages 5) E.g., Rv. vi. 1, 8; 26, 1; viii. 71, 11; manus2o vis4a1h2, vi. 14, 2; viii. 23, 13; ma1nus2i1h2, x. 80, 6, etc. the general sense of ‘people’ is adequate; as when the Rigveda speaks of the ‘A1ryan people,’ 6) Rv. x. 11, 4. or the ‘divine people,’ 7) Rv. iii. 34, 2; Av. vi. 98, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 86. or the ‘Da1sa people,’ and so on. 8) Rv. iv. 28, 4; vi. 25, 2; adevi1h2, viii. 96, 15; asikni1h2, vii. 5, 3, etc. Sometimes, 9) Rv. ii. 26, 3, where it is opposed to jana, janman, and putra1h2; x. 84, 4, where in battle vis4am2-vis4am apparently refers to divisions of the host cf. also iv. 24, 4. vis4o yudhma1h2); x. 91, 2, where it is opposed to gr2ha and jana; Av. xiv. 2, 27, where gr2hebhyah2 is followed by asyai sarvasyai vis4e, which must mean a division less than a whole people. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 159, reckons here Rv. i. 172, 3; vii. 33, 6; ix. 7, 5; x. 124, 8; 173, 1; but these cases and many others are rather instances of ‘subjects’ than of a division of the tribe such as ‘canton.’ however, the Vis4 appear in a more special sense as a subdivision of the Jana or whole people. This is, however, not common, for in most passages one or other of the senses given above is quite possible. Moreover, it is very difficult to decide whether the Vis4 as a subdivision of the Jana is to be considered as being a local subdivision (canton) or a blood kinship equivalent to a clan in the large sense of the word, while the relation of the Vis4 to the Gra1ma or to the Gotra is quite uncertain. In one passage of the Atharvaveda 10) xv. 8, 2, 3, Cf. xiv. 2, 27, and Rv. x. 91, 2, in n. 9. the Vis4ah2 are mentioned along with the sabandhavah2 or relatives, but no definite conclusion can be drawn from that fact. Nor does the analogy of the Roman curia or the Greek  throw much light, as these institutions are themselves of obscure character, and the parallelism need not be cogent. It is, at any rate, possible that the Vis4 may in some cases have been no more than a Gotra or clan, or different clans may sometirnes have made up a Vis4, while Gra1ma is more definitely, perhaps, a local designation. But the Vedic evidence is quite inconclusive. 11) The Vis4 may have been oringinally a clan settled in one place: there is no passage where ‘Gotra’ would not probably make sense; Rv. ii. 26, 3, cannot be pressed unduly to distinguish ianman and Vis4. Compare the phrase used of the Maruts s4ardham2 s4ardham, vra1tam2 vra1tam, gan2am2 gan2am, in Rv. v. 53. 11, where no precise sense can fairly be attributed to the words, though Zimmer sees in them a threefold division of the host corresponding to Jana, Vis4, and Gra1ma. The rendering ‘Gau’ has therefore little foundation. Cf. Vis4pati. In the later period the sense of Vis4 is definitely restricted in some cases 12) Perhaps to this sense belong the numerous passages in the Bra1hman2as and later Sam2hita1s referring to strife between the Vis4 and the Ks2atra, the clansmen and the chiefs, or the peasantry and the nobles--e.g., Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 11, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii, 1, 9; iii. 3, 10; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita, xix. 9 and often. See also Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 10, 9; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 3, 5; viii. 7, 2, 3; xiii. 2, 2, 17. 19; 9, 6; xiv. 1, 3, 27, etc.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 14. Cf. Zimmer, A1tindisches Leben, 15 et seq.; Schrader. Prehistoric Autiquities, 800 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 158; von Schroeder, Indiens Literalur und Cultur, 32, 33; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. For the Roman curia, which was apparently a collection of gentes, perhaps local, cf. Mommsen, History of Rome, 1, 72, et seq.; Ro7mische Forschungen, 1. 140-150; Ro7misches Staatsrecht, 3, 9; Taylor, History of Rome. 11, 12; Smith, Dictionary of Antiquities, 1, 576; Cuq, Les institutions juridiques des Romains, 30-36, For the Greek Phratria which was probably similar in character, consisting of a union of  see Dictionary of Antiquities, 2, 876 et seq.; Greenidge, Greek Constitutional History, 128 et seq.; Bury, History of Greece, 69, 70; Gilbert, Greek Constitutional Antiquities, 1, 104 et seq., 210. For the English hundreds, and the supposed analogy of the pagi of Tacitus, see the references in Medley, English Constitutional History,^2 318 et seq. to denote the third of the classes of the Vedic polity, the people or clansmen as opposed to the nobles (Ks2atra, Ks2atriya) and the priests (Brahman, Bra1hman2a). For the position of this class, see Vais4va.

विशर
वि-शर
 is found as the name of a disease, perhaps ‘tearing pains,’ in the Atharvaveda. 1) ii. 4, 2. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben. 391. thinks that the pains in the limbs attendant on fever (Takman) are alluded to. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. sees in the word the name of a demon. The view of Zimmer is supported by the use of vis4ari1ka, ‘rending,’ beside Bala1sa in another passage. 4) xix. 34, 10. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymas of the Athervaveda, 284. 

विशाखे
वि-शाखे
 See Naks2atra

विश्पति
विश्-पति
 is a word of somewhat uncertain signification, reflecting in this respect the nature of Vis4. Zimmer holds that in its strict sense it denotes the head of a canton, but he admits that there is no passage requiring this sense, the only one quoted by him 2) Rv. i. 37. 8. being certainly indecisive. In the great majority of passages the word simply means the ‘lord of the dwelling,’ whether used of a man or of the god Agni as the householder par excellence, or possibly as the fire of the Sabha1 or assembly house of the people. This sense suits even the passage of the Rigveda 4) vii. 55, 5 = Av. iv. 5, 6. in which the Vis4pati, as well as the father and the mother of a maiden, 5) So Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 337 et seq.; Zimmer, op. cit., 308. Cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 370. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 55 et seq., accepts the view of the Br2haddevata1, vi. 11 et seq. (where see Macdonell's note), that the hymn refers to Vasis2t2ha's approaching a house as a thief! The interpretation does not affect the sense of Vis4pati, which here is clearly not the title of a cantonal chief. Vis4 is sometimes equivalent to Saja1ta; cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 3, 2. 3. are to be lulled to sleep in order to allow her lover to approach her, for the household may well be deemed to have been a joint family, in which the Vis4pati could easily be different from the father of the girl--e.g., a grandfather or uncle. In other passages 6) Av. iii. 4, 1; iv. 22, 3. Perhaps Rv. iii. 13, 5, is so to be taken; cf. vii. 39, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 22. the Vis4pati is the king as ‘lord of the subject-people’ (vis4a1m), though here Zimmer 7) Op. cit., 164, 165. thinks reference is made to the election of a king. 8) But see Ra1jan. Or again, 7) Op. cit., 164. 165. the Vis4pati is the chief of the Vis4, probably in the sense of ‘subjects.’ 1) Altindisches Leben, 171. 9) E.g., Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 1, 3, where Vis4 must clearly be the people or subject class, and the Vis4pati their chief representative; we cannot from such a passage infer a formal office of Vis4pati even as head of the Vis4.

विश्पला
विश्पला
 is, according to the tradition in the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 10: 116 15; 11. 11: 118. 8; x. 39, 8. the name of a woman to whom the As4vins gave an iron (a1yasi1) limb to replace one lost by her in a contest. Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1. 171-173. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 52; Muir, Saniskrit Texts, 5, 245; Bloomfield, Religion of the Veda, 113; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 110, 111. considers that a racing horse miraculously cured of a broken limb by the As4vins is meant, but this is no more than an improbable conjecture.

विश्वक
विश्वक,
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 23; 117. 7; viii. 86, 1; x. 65, 12. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 52. called Kr2s2n2iya (possibly ‘son of Kr2s2n2a’) is a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, who restored to him his lost son, Vis2n2a1pu. See 2. Kr2s2n2a.

विश्वकर्मन्भौवन
विश्व-कर्मन् भौवन
 (‘descendant of Bhuvana’) is the name of a quite mythical king. He is said in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a to have been consecrated by Kas4yapa, to whom he offered the earth (i.e., presumably a piece of land) as a sacrificial fee; in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 7, 1, 15. he performed the Sarvamedha (‘universal sacrifice’), and made a similar offer; in both cases the earth refused to be given. The story seems to contain a reference to the early dislike of gifts of land, 3) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 47. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 421, n, 1; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 456, 457. but it cannot be stated with certainty that this is the meaning. ^1 viii. 21, 8.

विश्वन्तरसौषद्मन
विश्वन्-तर सौ-षद्मन
 (‘descendant of Sus2adman’) is the name in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 27, 3, 4; 34, 7, 8. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 431-440; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 344, n. of a prince who set aside the S4ya1parn2as, his priests, and performed a sacrifice without their help, presumably with the aid of others. Ra1ma Ma1rgaveya, one of the S4ya1parn2as, however, succeeded in inducing the king to reinstate the S4ya1parn2as, and to give him a thousand cows.

विश्वमनस्
विश्व-मनस्
 is the name of a R2s2i mentioned in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 23, 2; 24, 7. and as a frined of Indra in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 2) xv. 5, 20. According to the Anukraman2i1 (Index), he was a descendant of Vyas4va, and the author of certain hymns. 3) Rv. viii. 23-26. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 106.

विश्वमानुष
विश्व-मानुष
 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 45, 22. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 187. may be a proper name, but more probably merely means ‘all mankind.’

विश्ववार
विश्व-वार
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) v. 44, 11. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. apparently as the name of a sacrificer.

विश्वासामन्
विश्वा-सामन्
 is the name of a R2s2i, an Atreya, in the Rigveda. 1) v. 22, 1. Cf. Oldenberg. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215.

विश्वसृज्
विश्व-सृज्
 is the name of certain mythical beings to whom, however, a Sattra, or sacrificial session, is ascribed in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xxv. 18, 1 et seq.).

विश्वामित्र
विश्वा-मित्र
 (‘friend of all’) is the name of a R2s2i who is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) As son of Kus4ika in Rv. iii. 33, 5; as Vis4va1mitra in iii. 53, 7, 12. and to whom the third Man2d2ala is attributed by tradition. In one hymn 2) iii. 33. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 121, thinks the hymn too poetical to be a real composition of the reputed author. which appears to be his own composition, he praises the rivers Vipa1s4 (Beas) and S4utudri1 (Sutlej). There he calls himself the son of Kus4ika, and seems unquestionably to be the helper of the Bharatas, whom he mentions. The tribe, engaged in a raid, apparently came to the rivers from the east. 4) So Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 152. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 127, 128, takes a different view: with Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 90, he assumes that the Bharatas were different from the Tr2tsus, and that they came under Vis4va1mitra from the West, but were defeated (see Rv. vii. 33, 6). But see Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 34, n. 1; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 136. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 41, 42, still defends Roth's view. Anxious to cross them, they ^3 Rv. iii. 33, 5. found them in high flood, but Vis4va1mitra by prayer induced the waters to subside. The same feat appears to be referred to in another passage of the same book of the Rigveda. 5) iii. 53, 9-11. This hymn is probably later. Curiously enough, Sa1yan2a 6) Sa1yan2a on Rv. iii. 33. quite misunderstands the situation: according to him, Vis4va1mitra having obtained wealth by the exercise of his office, went off with it to the rivers, pursued by others. Ya1ska's 7) Nirukta, ii. 24. version of the tale merely seems to mean that the king paid Vis4va1mitra to act as his Purohita, or domestic priest. For the relations of Vis4va1mitra to Vasis2t2ha connected with their service of Suda1s, see Vasis2t2ha. The Vis4va1mitras are mentioned in several other passages of the Rigveda, 8) iii. 1, 21; 18, 4; 53, 13; x. 89, 17; Av. xviii. 3, 6; 4, 54; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 15, 1. and are also designated as a family by the term Kus4ikas. 9) Rv. iii. 26, 1. 3; 29, 15; 30, 20; 42, 9; 53, 9. 10. In the later literature Vis4va1mitra becomes, like Vasis2t2ha, a mythical sage, usually 10) Cf. Rv. iii. 53, 15. 16; S2ad2gurus4is2ya in Macdonell's edition of the Sarva1nukraman2i1, p. 107; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 117; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 343; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 158 et seq. mentioned in connection with Jamadagni; he was Hotr2 priest at the sacrifice of S4unah2s4epa, whom he adopted, and to whom he gave the name of Devara1ta. 11) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 16 et seq.; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 17 et seq. He was a prote4ge4 of Indra, with whom he had an interview according to the Rigveda A1ran2yakas. 12) Aitareya A1ran2yaka. ii. 2, 3; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, i. 5. He is also often mentioned as a R2s2i. 13) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 2, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 18, 1; 20, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 1, 2; iii. 1, 7, 3; v. 2, 3, 4, etc.; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 19; xx. 9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 7, 19; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xv. 1; xxvi. 14; xxviii. 1. 2; xxix. 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 3, 12; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 2, 4; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 13; 15, 1, etc. Jamadagni is often associated with him, Av. iv. 29, 5, etc. In the Epic 14) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 388 et seq. Vis4va1mitra is represented as a king, who becomes a Brahmin. There is no trace of his kingship in the Rigveda, but the Nirukta 15) ii. 24. calls his father, Kus4ika, a king; the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 16) vii. 18, 9. But the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 27, has a completely different version, which Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 16, n. 3, prefers, and which omits all allusion to the ‘lordship’ of the Jahnus. This shows how little stress can-be laid on this latetradition. refers to S4unah2s4epa as succeeding to the lordship of the Jahnus, as well as the ‘divine lore’ (daiva veda) of the Ga1thins; and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 17) xxi. 12, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 121; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 209, 210; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 337 et seq.; Weber, op. cit., 16 et seq.; Indian Literature, 31, 37, 38, 53, etc. mentions Vis4va1mitra as a king. But there is no real-trace of this kingship of Vis4va1mitra: it may probably be dismissed as a mere legend, with no more foundation at most than that Vis4va1mitra was of a family which once had been royal. But even this is doubtful.

विष
विष
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 117, 16; 191, 11; vi. 61, 3; x. 87. 18, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 6, 2; v. 19, 10; vi. 90, 2, etc. regularly denotes ‘poison’ as an antidote, for which the Atharvaveda supplies spells. 3) Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61.

विषविद्या
विष-विद्या,
 the ‘science of poison,’ is enumerated with other sciences in the A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra (x. 75). Cf. Vidya1.

विषाणा
विषाणा
 in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 7, 1. 2; vi. 121, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 11, 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 3, 2, 17. Primarily a deciduous horn is meant. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 94. and later^2 denotes an animal's ‘horn.’

विषाणका
विषाणका
 is the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 44, 3. Cf. Vis2a1n2ika1 in Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 146, perhaps the Asclepias geminata; Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 12, 426; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68. But cf. Whitney. Translation of the Atharvaveda, 313. Bloomfield, 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 482. however, thinks that the word may merely mean ‘horn.’ It is used as a remedy against the disease Va1ti1ka1ra. 3) Av. ix. 8, 20; Va1ti1-kr2ta, vi. 44, 3; 109, 3. That disease is of doubtful character: Zimmer 4) Op. cit., 389. 390. thinks that it is one ‘caused by wounds,’ comparing the adjective a-va1ta, ‘uninjured,’ in the Rigveda, 5) vi. 16, 20; ix. 96, 8. but Bloomfield 6) Op. cit., 481 et seq., 516. shows that ‘wind’ in the body is meant as causing the disease.

विषाणिन्
विषाणिन्
 occurs once in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 7. as the name of a tribe in the list of the enemies of the Tr2tsus, not as Roth 2) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. But Zimmer, op. cit., 430, 431, altered his view, and Hopkins' criticism, overlooking this retractation, in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260, 261, is so far unjustified. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. thought, of their allies. The word seems to mean ‘having horns,’ but in what sense is unknown; perhaps their helmets were horn-shaped or ornamented with horns. They may, like their allies, the Alinas, Bhala1nas, S4ivas, and Pakthas, be reckoned as belonging to the tribes of the north-west.

विषूवन्त्
1. Vis2u1vant denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 7, 15. and later 2) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 2; 7, 1; v. 9, 10; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 41, 4; iv. 18, 1; 22, 1. 2; vi. 18, 8; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxv. 1; xxvi. 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 3, 2; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 1, 2, 2; 3, 14. 23; 4, 2; 2, 1, 8, etc. the middle day in the Sattra or sacrificial session of a year's duration. Tilak 3) Orion, 21, 22. argues that the Vis2u1vant literally means the day when night and daylight are equal--i.e., the equinoctial day--and that this is the true sense of the word. But the theory is without probability. ^4 Cf. Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ixxxiii. et seq.

विषूवन्त्
2. Vis2u1vant occurs in the description of the house in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 3, 8. The meaning seems to be tha ‘ridge of the roof.’ 2) Cf. Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 151 (who thinks it is a metaphor from the parting of the hair); Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 598; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 526. 

विषूचिका
विषूचिका
 is the name of a disease mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 1) xix. 10 = Maitra1yah2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 7 = Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 18 = Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 1, 5 = S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 7, 3, 2. as a result of over-indulgence in Soma drinking. It seems clearly to be ‘dyser ery,’ or, as Wise calls it, ‘sporadic cholera.’ The term apparently means ‘causing evacuations in both directions.’ 2) Hindu System of Medicine, 330. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 275, 392.

विष्कन्ध
वि-ष्कन्ध
 occurs severai times in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 16, 3; ii. 4, 1 et seq.; iii. 9, 2. 6; iv. 9, 5; xix. 34, 5. It is also found in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 3, 11, 1. as the name of a disease. As rem dies against it a lead amulet, 2) Av. i. 16, 3. Cf. ii. 4; iii. 9, 6. or hemp, 3) Av. ii. 4, 5. or a salve, 4) Av. iv. 9, 5. or the Ja gid2a plant are recommended for use. 5) Av. ii. 4, 1. 5; xix. 34. 5; 35, 1. Weber 6) Indische Studien, 4, 410; 13, 141; 17, 215. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 390, 391; Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 75. suggests that the disease meant is ‘rheumatism,’ because it draws the shoulders apart (vi-skandha), but Bloomfield 7) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 282, 283. thinks that it is rather the name of a demon, like the Rigvedic Vyam2s4a 8) Rv. i. 32, 5, etc. and Vigri1va, 9) Rv. viii. 4, 24. both of which are similarly formed and are names of demons. Possibly Kars4apha and Vis4apha mentioned in one hymn 10) Av. iii. 9, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, op. cit., 340. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., thinks demons are meant: this seems the more probable view. are plants used to cure the disease.

विष्टारिन्
वि-ष्टारिन्
 in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 34, 1 et seq. According to Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 206, the designation ‘outspread’ is due to the fact that the rice mess was kneaded into furrows and juices (rasa) were poured into them. See Kaus4ika Su1tra, lxvi. 6. denotes a special sort of Odana or porridge.

विष्ठाव्राजिन्
विष्ठा-व्राजिन्
 is a word of doubtful significance in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) v. 1, 12. According to Sa1yan2a, it means ‘remaining in one and the same place’; if this is right, the rendering of the St. Petersburg Dictionary and of Bo7htlingk's Dictionary, ‘one whose herd is stationary,’ seems legitimate. But, as Eggeling 2) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 123, n. 1. points out, the Ka1n2va recension of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a in another passage 3) Ibid., 50, n. 1. seems to treat the word as denoting a disease: thus Vis2t2ha1vra1jin may mean ‘one afflicted by dysentery.’

विष्णापु
विष्णापु
 is the son of Vis4vaka in the Rigveda. 1) i. 116, 23; 117, 7; viii. 86, 3; x. 65, 12. When lost he was restored to his father by the As4vins.

विष्फुलिङ्ग
विष्फुलिङ्ग
 denotes a ‘spark’ of fire in the Upanis2ads. 1) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii, 1, 23; vi. 1, 12; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 3; iv. 20, etc. Cf. vis2pulin3gaka, ‘scattering sparks of fire,’ in Rv. i. 191, 12 (Sa1yan2a, ‘a tongue of fire,’ or ‘sparrow’).

विष्वक्सेन
विष्वक्-सेन
 is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Na1rada, mentioned in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) at the end of the Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a.

विसल्य
विसल्य
 1) ix. 8, 20. and Visalyaka 2) vi. 127, 1 et seq.; ix. 8, 2. 5; xix. 44, 2. are names of a disease in the Atharvaveda. Since Shan3kar Pan2d2it's reciters 3) See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 601; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 378, 384. pronounced the word as Visalpaka in all the passages, that should probably be adopted as the right reading. 4) The commentator Sa1yan2a on vi. 127 reads visalpakah2, and on xix. 44, 2, visarpakah2. Some sort of pain is meant, perhaps ‘neuralgia,’ in connexion with fever.

विस्रस्
वि-स्रस्
 denotes the ‘decay’ of old age, ‘decrepitude,’ ‘senility.’ 1) Av. xix. 34, 3, where Bohtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., suggests for visrasas the emendation visruhas (cf. Rv. vi. 7, 6); Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 20, 5; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 3, 7; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 20, 7; Ka1thaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4. 

विहल्ह
विहल्ह
 is found in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 16, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. apparently as the name of a plant. The forms Viham2la and Vihahla occur as variants.

वीणा
वीणा
 in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 4, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 6, 8. and the Bra1hman2as 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 4, 6; xiii. 1, 5, 1; s4ata-tantri1, ‘hundredstringed’ (like the Va1n2a), at the Maha1vrata rite, S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvii. 3, 1, etc.; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 42 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 235). denotes a ‘lute.’ A Vi1n2a1-va1da, ‘lute-player,’ is included in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 20; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 15, 1. and is also mentioned elsewhere. 4) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 4, 8; iv. 5, 9. The Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 5) iii. 2, 5; cf. Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 9. which states that the instrument was once covered with a hairy skin, enumerates its parts as S4iras, ‘head’ (i.e., neck); Udara, ‘cavity’; Ambhan2a, ‘sounding board’; Tantra, ‘string’; and Va1dana, ‘plectrum.’ In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 6) xiii. 4, 2, 8. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 356, n. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 328; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 755. the Uttaramandra1 is either a tune or a kind of lute. Cf. Va1n2a.

वीणागाथिन्
वीणा-गाथिन्
 denotes ‘lute-player’ in the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 14, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 1, 5, 1; 4, 2, 8. 11. 14; 3, 5. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a Vi1n2a1gan2agin denotes the ‘leader of a band.’ 2) xiii. 4, 3, 3; 4, 2; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 1, 29.

वीणावाद
वीणा-वाद
 See Vi1n2a1.

वीतहव्य
वीत-हव्य
 is the name of a prince who is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vi. 15, 2. 3. along with Bharadva1ja, and as a contemporary of Suda1s, 2) vii. 19, 3. though in both passages it is possible to understand the word as a mere adjective. In the Atharvaveda 3) vi. 137, 1. Vi1tahavya appears as connected with Jamadagni and Asita, but it is clear that the legend there has no value. It is possible, though not certain, that he was a king of the Sr2n2jayas. 4) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. In the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 6, 5, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxii. 3; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 16, 3. Ibid., ix. 1, 9, he is represented as being niruddha, apparently in ‘banishment’; but the scholiast explains him as not a king, but a R2s2i, which is quite possible. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212; Buddha, 405. a Vi1tahavya S4ra1yasa appears as a king: he may be identical with the Vi1tahavya of the Rigveda, or belong to the same line. Cf. Vaitahavya.

वीर
वीर
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 18, 4; 114, 8; iv. 29, 2; v. 20, 4; 61, 5, etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 26, 4; iii. 5, 8, etc. denotes ‘man’ as the strong and heroic. Collectively in the singular 3) Rv. ii. 32, 4; iii. 4, 9; 36, 10; vii. 34, 20, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 8, 1, etc. the word denotes ‘male offspring,’ an object of great desire (cf. Putra) to the Vedic Indian. The Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 4) xix. 1, 4. Viz., the king's brother, his son, Purohita, Mahis2i1, Su1ta, Gra1man2i1, Ks2attr2, and Sam2grahi1tr2. See Ratnin. gives a list of eight Vi1ras of the king, constituting his supporters and entourage.

वीरण
वीरण
 is the form in the late S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a (v. 2) of the name of the plant Vi1rin2a.

वीरहत्या
वीर-हत्या,
 ‘murder of a man,’ is one of the crimes referred to in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 1) x. 40. The Vi1ra-han, ‘man-slayer,’ is often mentioned in the older texts. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 2, 1; ii. 2, 5, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxi. 7; Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xii. 6, 8; xvi. 1, 12, etc. Cf. Vaira. 

वीरिण
वीरिण
 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xiii. 8, 1, 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. denotes a kind of grass (Andropogon muricatus). See Vairin2a.

वीरुध्
वीरुध्
 means ‘plant’ in the Rigveda, 1) i. 67, 9; 141, 4; ii. 1, 14; 35, 8, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 32, 3; 34, 1; ii. 7, 1; v. 4, 1; xix. 35, 4, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 57. As contrasted with Os2adhi, it denotes the inferior order of plants, but it often has practically the same sense as Os2adhi.

वृक
1. Vr2ka, ‘wolf,’ is mentioned frequently in the Rigveda, 1) i. 42, 2; 105, 7; 116, 14; ii. 29, 6; vi. 51, 14; vii. 38, 7, etc. and also later. 2) Av. vii. 95, 2; xii. 1, 49; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 10; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iv. 34; xix. 10. 92, etc. It was an enemy of sheep 3) Rv. viii. 34, 3; ura1-mathi, ‘worrying sheep,’ x. 66, 8. and of calves, 4) Av. xii. 4. 7. being dangerous even to men. 5) Rv. i. 105, 11, 18; ii. 29, 6. In Nirukta, v. 21, Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 16, sees the sense of ‘dog,’ which seems needless. Cf. Nirukta, Erla1uterungen, 67. Its colour is stated to be reddish (arun2a). 6) Rv. i. 105, 18. The ‘she-wolf,’ Vr2ki1, is also mentioned several times in the Rigveda. 7) i. 116, 16; 117, 17; 183, 4; vi. 51, 6; x. 127, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 14.

वृक
2. Vr2ka in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 117, 21; viii. 22, 6; Nirukta, v. 26. denotes ‘plough.’

वृकद्वरस्
वृक-द्वरस्
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) ii. 30, 4. which Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153; Griffith; Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 297, n. interprets as referring to a battle against Vr2kadvaras, king of the S4an2d2ikas. But this is quite uncertain. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gescllschaft, 48, 110. and Oldenberg 4) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 211. incline to read vr2kadhvaras. Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 442. suggests Iranian connections, but without any clear reason. 

वृक्ष
वृक्ष
 is the ordinary term for tree' in the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 20. 22; ii. 14, 2; 39, 1; iv. 20, 5; v. 78, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 14, 1; ii. 12, 3; vi. 45, 1; xii. 1, 27, 51, etc. In the Atharvaveda 3) Av. xviii. 2, 25. Cf. Br2haddevata1, v. 83, with Macdonell's note (d). it denotes the coffin made from a tree, no doubt by hollowing it out. The S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a 4) Indische Studien, 1, 40, and cf. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 214. refers to the portent of a tree secreting blood.

वृक्षसर्पी
वृक्ष-सर्पी,
 ‘tree-creeper,’ is the name of a species of worm or female serpent in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

वृक्ष्य
वृक्ष्य
 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (i. 1, 1, 10) denotes the ‘fruit of a tree.’

वृचया
वृचया
 is referred to once in the Rigveda 1) i. 51, 3. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 3, 203, who distinguishes two Kaks2i1vants, but without sufficient reason, since i. 116, 17, must clearly refer to Vr2caya1. as the spouse given by the As4vins to Kaks2i1vant.

वृचीवन्त्
वृचीवन्त्
 is the name of a tribe referred to once in the Rigveda, 1) vi. 27, 5 et seq. where it is clearly stated that the Sr2n5jaya king, Daivava1ta, conquered the Turvas4a king and the Vr2ci1vants. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 124. thinks that the Vr2ci1vants and the Turvas4a people should be identified, but this is both unnecessary and improbable; it is adequate to assume that they were allied against 3) Oldenberg, Buddha, 404; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153: Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. the Sr2n5jayas. The Vr2ci1vants appear again only in the strange legend in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 4) xxi. 12, 2. according to which the Jahnus and the Vr2ci1vants contended for sovereignty, Vis4va1mitra, the Jahnu king, winning it by his knowledge of a certain rite. See also Hariyu1pi1ya1. 

वृजन
वृजन,
 according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. denotes in several passages of the Rigveda 2) i. 51, 15, 73, 2; 91, 21; 105, 19; 128, 7; 165, 15; 166, 14, etc. the ‘settlement’ or ‘village,’ the German ‘Mark’ and its inhabitants. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 142, 159, 161. accepting this view, sees in Vr2jana the ‘secure abode’ (ks2iti dhruva1) where the clan lives, 4) Rv. i. 51, 15; 73, 2 (cf. i. 73, 4). the clan itself as a village community (like Gra1ma), and the clan in war. 5) Rv. vii. 32, 27; x. 42, 10. Geldner, 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 139 et seq. on the other hand, takes the literal sense of Vr2jana t2o be ‘net,’ developing all the other senses from that idea, but the traditional view seems more natural.

वृत्रघ्न
वृत्र-घ्न
 occurs in a passage of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) viii. 23, 5. where in a Ga1tha1 reciting the prowess of Bharata it is said that he bound horses on the Yamuna1 (Jumna) and Gan3ga1 (Ganges) Vr2traghne, which Sa1yan2a renders ‘at Vr2traghna,’ as the name of a place. Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Aufrecht, Aitarecya Bra1hman2a, 425. however, seems right in interpreting the form as a dative, ‘for the slayer of Vr2tra’--i.e., Indra.

वृत्रशङ्कु
वृत्र-शङ्कु,
 literally ‘Vr2tra-peg,’ found in one passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) xiii. 8, 4, 1. is said by the scholiast on the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra 2) xxi. 3, 31. to denote a stone pillar. This improbable interpretation is based on another passage in the same Bra1hman2a. 3) iv. 2, 5, 15. Cf. Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 437, n. 1.

वृद्धद्युम्नआभिप्रतारिण
वृद्ध-द्युम्न आभिप्रतारिण
 (‘descendant of Abhiprata1rin’) is the name of a prince (ra1janya) in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (iii. 48, 9), where his priest, S4ucivr2ks2a Gaupala1yana, is praised. In the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xv, 16, 10-13), on the contrary, he is said to have erred in the sacrifice, when a Brahmin prophesied that the result would be the expulsion of the Kurus from Kuruks2etra, an event which actually came to pass. 

वृद्धवाशिनी
वृद्ध-वाशिनी
 in the Nirukta (v. 21) denotes the ‘female jackal.’ ^1. Vr2s4a. See Vr2s2a.

वृशजान
2. Vr2s4a Ja1na (‘descendant of Jana’) is the name of a famous Purohita, who was unfortunate enough, while with his royal master, Tryarun2a, to see a boy killed by the chariot which the king drove too fast. He thereupon recalled the boy to life. The story is told briefly in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xiii. 3, 12. the S4a1t2ya1yanaka, 2) See Sa1yan2a on Rv. v. 2, and the Jaimini1ya version in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 20. the Ta1n2d2aka, 3) See Sa1yan2a, loc. cit. was also narrated in the Bha1llavi Bra1hman2a, 4) Referred to in the Br2haddevata1, v. 23, apparently as cited in the Nida1na. The passage is not in the extant text of the Nida1na Su1tra. See Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda 65, n. 5. and is preserved in the Br2haddevata1, 5) v. 14 et seq., where see Macdonell's notes. Sieg 6) Op, cit., 64-76. has endeavoured to trace the story in part in the Rigveda, 7) v. 2. but there is a consensus of opinion 8) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 4, 324; Hillebrandt, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 33, 248 et seq.; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 366 et seq.; R2gveda-Noten, 1, 312. On the other hand, Geldner, Festgruss an Roth, 192, supports the tradition. Cf. Weber. Indische Studien, 10, 32. against the correctness of such a view.

वृश्चिक
वृश्चिक
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 16. and the Atharvaveda 2) x. 4, 9, 15; xii. 1, 46; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 27. denote ‘scorpion.’ Its poison was feared 3) Rv., loc. cit.; Av. x. 4, 9. 15. like that of serpents. It is described as lying torpid in the earth during winter. 4) Av. xii. 1, 46. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

वृष
वृष
 is the name of a plant of some kind in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 1) xxx. 1. Later the Gendarussa vulgaris is so styled. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 2) iv. 8, 1. has Vr2s4a, which Bo7htlingk 3) Dictionary, General Inden to Supplements, 376. takes to mean a small animal, a quite possible sense. Cf. Yeva1s2a. 

वृषखादि
वृष-खादि
 is used as an epithet of the Maruts in the Rigveda. 1) i. 64, 10. The sense is doubtful: Bollensen 2) Orient und Occident, 2, 461, n. thought the expression referred to the wearing of rings in the ears; Max Mu7ller 3) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 107, 120, Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 263. renders it ‘strong rings,’ comparing the later Cakra or discus.

वृषगण
वृष-गण
 is the name of a family of singers mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) ix. 97, 8. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 132.

वृषणश्व
वृषण्-अश्व
 is the name of a man referred to in the Rigveda, 1) i. 51, 13. where Indra is called Mena1, perhaps his ‘wife’ or ‘daughter.’ The same legend is alluded to in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, 2) ii. 79 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 37). the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) iii. 3, 4, 18. the S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 4) i. 1, 16. and the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, 5) i. 12, 3. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 81, n. 2. but it is clear that all of these texts had no real tradition of what was referred to.

वृषदंश
वृष-दंश,
 ‘strong-toothed,’ is the name of the cat in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 21, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 31. where it figures as a victim at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’). It also appears in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a; 2) viii. 2, 2. the fact that the sneeze of the cat is here referred to renders it likely that the animal was already tamed. Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 313-315. sees a house cat in the animal alluded to in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 4) i. 18. by a set of curious epithets, including vr2s2adati1, ‘strong-toothed,’ but Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 19, 20; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 153, n.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 261. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. decisively rejects the idea that the hymn refers to the domestic cat. 

वृषन्
वृषन्
 in two passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 36, 10; vi. 16, 14. 15. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 152, 153; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 104. seems to denote a man, with the patronymic Pa1thya in one of them.

वृषभ
वृषभ
 regularly denotes a ‘bull’ in the Rigveda, 1) i. 94, 10; 160, 3; vi. 46, 4; of Parjanya, vii. 101, 1, 6, etc. Roth renders vrsabha1nna, ii. 16, 5, ‘eating strong food’; but the literal sense, ‘whose food is bulls,’ will answer. Cf. Ma1m2sa. but usually in a metaphorical sense.

वृषल
वृषल
 in the dicing hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 34, 11. Cf. Nirukta, iii. 16. denotes an ‘outcast’; the same sense appears in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 2) vi. 4, 12 Ma1dhyam2dina. where the touch of either a Vr2s2ala or a Vr2s2ali1 is to be avoided.

वृषशुष्मवातावत
वृष-शुष्म वातावत
 (‘descendant of Va1ta1vant’) Ja1tu1karn2ya is the name of a priest in the Bra1hman2as of the Rigveda. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 29, 1; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, ii. 9 (with a varia lectio Va1dha1vata: Indische Studien, 1, 215, n. 1). Vr2s2as4us2ma in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) Indische Studien, 4, 373. is probably intended for the same name.

वृषारव
वृषा-रव,
 ‘roaring like a bull,’ is the name of some animal in the Rigveda. 1) x. 146, 2 = Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 5, 6. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xii. 5, 2, 7. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 426: Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90. the word occurs in the dual, meaning perhaps ‘mallet’ or ‘drumstick.’

वृष्टि
वृष्टि
 is the regular word for ‘rain’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 12; ii. 5, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. iii. 31, 11; vi. 22, 3, etc. 

वृष्टिहव्य
वृष्टि-हव्य
 is in the Rigveda 1) x. 115, 9. Cf. Max Mu1ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 152, 153; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108, 109. the name of a R2s2i, whose sons were the Upastutas.

वेणु
वेणु
 in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 27, 3. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 5, 2; vii. 4, 19, 2; Ka1thaka Sam2hita1, xiii. 12; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 19; ii. 6, 2, 17, etc. denotes a ‘reed’ of bamboo, It is described in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) v. 1, 1, 4. as ‘hollow’ (su-s2ira). In the Rigveda 4) viii. 55, 3. it occurs only in a Va1lakhilya hymn in a Da1nastuti (‘praise of gifts’), where Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. thinks that ‘flutes of reed’ are meant, a sense which Ven2u has in the later texts. The Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 6) iv. 12. couples Ven2u with Sasya, stating that they ripen in Vasanta, ‘spring.’ Apparently bamboo reeds are meant. 7) Cf. Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 6, 17, with the scholiast; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 343. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71.

वेतस
वेतस
 is the name of the water plant Calamus Rotang, or a similar reed, in the Rigveda 1) iv. 58, 5. and later. 2) Av. x. 7, 41; xviii. 3, 5; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 3, 12, 2; 4, 4, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 4, 3, etc. It is called ‘golden’ (hiran2yaya) and ‘water-born’ (apsuja). 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 3, 12, 2, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71. ^3 Rv. loc. cit.; Av. x. 7, 41.

वेतसु
वेतसु
 is a name occurring in the singular in two passages of the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 8; 26, 4. and once in the plural. 2) x. 49, 4. It seems that he was defeated by Indra, but there is no reason to assume that he was a demon. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 128. Cf. Kaegi, Die Rigveda, n. 337. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. thinks that the Vetasus were probably the tribe of which Das4adyu was a member, and that they defeated the Tugras. The passages are too obscure to render any version probable. 

वेतस्वन्त्
वेतस्वन्त्,
 ‘abounding in reeds,’ is the name of a place in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) xxi. 14, 20. not, as Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 32. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 69. once took it, a part of the name of Ekaya1van Ga1m2dama.

वेद
वेद
 in the Atharvaveda 1) Av. vii. 54, 2; x. 8, 17; xv. 3, 7. and later 2) Traya, ‘threefold,’ S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 5, 10; xiii. 4, 3, 3; Nirukta, i. 2. 18. 20, etc. denotes ‘sacred lore.’ In the plural 3) Av. iv. 35, 6; xix. 2, 12; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 11, 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 32, 1; vi. 15, 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 11, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 3, 7; xii. 3, 4, 11, etc. In the Bra1hman2as the word, no doubt, has normally the sense of the extant collections, which appear under their accepted titles, R2gveda, Yajurveda, Sa1maveda, in the A1ran2yakas. it more definitely refers to the Vedas of the R2c, Yajus, and Sa1man. Cf. Vidya1.

वेदाङ्ग
वेदाङ्ग,
 as the name of a text subsidiary to the study of the Rigveda, is first found in the Nirukta 1) i. 20. and the Rigveda Pra1tis4a1khya. 2) xii. 40. Cf. Roth, Nirukta, xv. et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 42.

वेन
1. Vena occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) x. 93, 14. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. as a generous patron. Pr2thava1na, found in the same passage, may or may not be another name of his, and Pa1rthya in the following stanza of the hymn is perhaps his patronymic.

वेन
2. Vena in the Rigveda 1) x. 123. is thought by Tilak 2) Oriea, 163 et seq Cf. Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xciv. to be the planet Venus. But this is certainly impossible. 

वेश
1. Ves4a is a term of somewhat doubtful sense, apparently denoting ‘vassal,’ ‘tenant,’ in a few passages, 1) Rv. iv. 3, 13; v. 85, 7; possibly x. 49, 5; but cf. 2. Ves4a; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 5 (ves4atva.); xxxi. 12; xxxii. 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, Ka1n2va, ii. 5, 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 8; ii. 3, 7; iv. 1, 13. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 204, who takes ves4as in Av. ii. 32, 5, where pari-ves4as also occurs in the same sense, and compares vais4ya in Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 7, 1, as meaning ‘servitude’ and, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1, ves4a, and ves4atva. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 75, who seems inclined to read ves2as in Av. ii. 32, 5; but Weber's explanation of the origin of the sense of ‘servant’ is adequate. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 135, n. 4, sees in Ves4a either a neighbour or a member of the same village community. Cf. Saja1ta. ‘dependent neighbour.’

वेश
2. Ves4a may be a proper name in two passages of the Rigveda; 1) ii. 13, 8; x. 49, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152, 164. if so, it is quite uncertain whether a demon is meant or not.

वेशन्ता
वेशन्ता,
 1) Av. xi. 6, 10; xx. 128, 8, 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 12, 1. Ves4anti1, 2) Av. i. 3, 7. Ves4a1nta1, 3) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 11. all denote a ‘pond’ or ‘tank.’ Cf. Vais4anta.

वेशस्
वेशस्
 See 1. Ves4a.

वेशान्ता
वेशान्ता
 See Ves4anta1.

वेशी
वेशी
 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 17. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 264, n. seems to denote a ‘needle.’

वेश्मन्
वेश्मन्,
 ‘house,’ occurs in the Rigveda 1) x. 107, 10; 146, 3. and later. 2) Av. v. 17, 13; ix. 6, 30; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 24, 6, etc. In S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 2, 14, the single house (eka-ves4man) of the king is contrasted with the numerous dwellings of the people. It denotes the house as the place where a man is ‘settled’ (vis4). 

वेश्य
वेश्य
 in two passages of the Rigveda (iv. 26, 3; vi. 61, 14) seems to denote the relation of ‘dependence’ rather than ‘neighbourhood.’ Cf. 1. Ves4a.

वेष्क
वेष्क
 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (iii. 8, 1, 15) denotes the ‘noose’ for strangling the sacrificial animal. See Bles2ka.

वेहत्
वेहत्
 seems to mean a ‘cow that miscarries.’ It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 4, 37 et seq. In iii. 23, 1, a woman is called vehat. and later. 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 27; xxiv. 1, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 5, 3, etc. In S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 4, 4, 6, Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 195, adopts the sense ‘a cow desiring the bull.’ But cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 127.

वैकर्ण
वैकर्ण
 occurs but once in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 11. in the description of the Da1s4ara1jn5a, where Suda1s is stated to have overthrown the twenty-one tribes (jana1n) of the kings or folk of the two Vaikarn2as. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 103. conjectures that they were a joint people, the Kuru-Krivis: this is quite possible, and even probable. Vikarn2a as the name of a people is found in the Maha1bha1rata, 3) vi. 2105. and a lexicographer 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261 et seq., who sees in Vaikarn2au the two Vaikarn2a kings. places the Vikarn2as in Kas4mi1r, a reminiscence probably of a real settlement of the Kurus in that country. Cf. Uttara Kuru.

वैखानस
वैखानस
 is the name of a mythical group of R2s2is who are said in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) xiv. 4, 7. to have been slain at Munimaran2a by Rahasyu Devamalimluc, and who are mentioned in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka also. 2) i. 23, 3 (Indische Studien, 1, 78). An individual Vaikha1nasa is Puruhanman. 3) xiv. 9, 29. 

वैजान
वैजान,
 ‘descendant of Vija1na,’ is Sa1yan2a's version of the patronymic of Vr2s4a in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xiii. 3, 12. The real reading is vai Ja1nah2, as pointed out by Weber. 2) Indische Studien, 10, 32.

वैट्टभटीपुत्र
वैट्टभटी-पुत्र
 is the name in the Ka1n2va recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 5, 2) of a teacher, a pupil of Ka1ras4akeyi1putra, Cf. Vaidabhr2ti1putra.

वैडव
वैडव,
 ‘descendant of Vi1d2u,’ is the patronymic of a Vaisis2t2ha in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xi. 8, 14), where he is said to have been the seer of a Sa1man or Chant.

वैदूर्य
वैदूर्य,
 ‘beryl,’ is first found in the late Adbhuta Bra1hman2a. 1) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 40; Omina und Portenta, 325 et seq.

वैतरण
वैतरण
 occurs once in the Rigveda. 1) x. 61, 17. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. thinks the word is a patronymic, but it seems rather 3) Ludwig, Translation of the Rig. veda, 3, 165; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 457, n. to be an adjective in the sense of ‘belonging to Vitaran2a’ used of Agni, like Agni of Bharata or of Vadhryas4va.

वैतहव्य
वैतहव्य,
 ‘descendant of Vi1tahavya,’ is the name of a family who are said in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 18, 10. 11; 19, 1. to have come to ruin because they devoured a Brahmin's cow. They are said to be Sr2n5jayas, but as the exact form of the legend here referred to does not occur elsewhere, its authenticity is open to some doubt. 2) Moomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 434. According to Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 132. Vaitahavya is a mere epithet of the Sr2n5jayas, but this is not probable 4) Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 405; Weber Indische Studien, 18, 233. in view of the existence of a Vi1tahavya. 

वैद
वैद,
 ‘descendant of Vida,’ is the patronymic of Hiran2yadant in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 6, 4; A1s4vala1yana S4ranta Su1tra, xii. 10, 9. and the Aitareya A1ran2yaka. 2) ii. 1, 5. The word is also written Baida.

वैदथिन
वैदथिन,
 ‘descendant of Vidathin,’ is the patronymic of R2jis4van in the Rigveda (iv. 16, 11; v. 29, 13).

वैददश्वि
वैदद्-अश्वि,
 ‘descendant of Vidadas4va,’ is the patronymic of Taranta in the Rigveda. 1) v. 61, 10. In the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 7, 12. Cf. S4a1t2ya1yanaka in Sa1yan2a on Rv. ix. 58, 3. and the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a 3) i. 151; iii. 139, where Vaitadas4vi is the form. Cf. A1rs2eya Bra1hman2a, p. 54 (ed. Burnell). Cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 360; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesell schaft, 42, 232, n.; R2gveda-Noten, 1, 354; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 62 et seq.. the Vaidadas4vis are Taranta and Purumi1lha. The latter is not a Vaidadas4vi in the Rigveda, a clear sign of the worthlessness of the legends relative to these two men in the Bra1hman2as.

वैदभृतीपुत्र
वैदभृती-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Vedabhr2t,’ is the name of a teacher in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Ma1dhyam2dina recension of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad (vi. 4, 32). Cf. Vait2t2abhat2i1putra.

In the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a 6) iii. 40, 1; iv. 16. 1. the patronymic is applied to Ra1ma Kra1tuja1teya. 

वैयास्क
वैयास्क
 is read in one passage of the Rigveda Pra1tis4a1khya, 1) xvii. 25. as the name of an authority on the metres of the Rigveda. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. is clearly right in thinking that Ya1ska is meant. 3) The name not being a patronymic from Viya1ska, but standing for vai Ya1skah2, Cf. Vaija1na.

वैर
वैर
 1) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 1, 12. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 2, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 2; Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1, viii. 5; Maitra1yan2i1, Sam2hita1, i. 7, 5, all of which have vi1ram for vairam, perhaps wrongly. and Vaira-deya 2) Rv. v. 61, 8 (on the exact sense of which, cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 361; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 92; Oldenberg, RgvedaNoten, 1, 354); Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 xxiii. 8; xxviii. 2. 3. 6. seem to have in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as the definite and technical sense of ‘wergeld,’ the money to be paid for killing a man as a compensation to his relatives. This view is borne out by the Su1tras of A1pastamba 3) i. 9, 24, 1-4. and Baudha1yana. 4) i. 10, 19, 1, 2. Both prescribe the scale of 1,000 cows for a Ks2atriya, 5) The crime of slaying a Brahmin is too heinous for a wergeld. See A1pastamba, i. 9, 24, 7 et seq.; Baudha1yana, i. 10, 18, 18. 100 for a Vais4ya, 10 for a S4u1dra, and a bull over and above in each case. A1pastamba leaves the destination of the payment vague, but Baudha1yana assigns it to the king. It is reasonable to suppose that the cows were intended for the relations, and the bull was a present to the king for his intervention to induce the injured relatives to abandon the demand for the life of the offender. The A1pastamba Su1tra 6) i. 9, 24, 5. allows the same scale of wergeld for women, but the Gautama Su1tra 7) i. 10, 19, 3. puts them on a level with men of the S4u1dra caste only, except in one special case. The payment is made for the purpose of vaira-ya1tana or vaira-nirya1tana, ‘requital of enmity,’ ‘expiation.’ The Rigveda 8) ii. 32, 4. preserves, also, the important notice that a man's wergeld was a hundred (cows), for it contains the epithet s4ata-da1ya, ‘one whose wergeld is a hundred.’ No doubt the values varied, but in the case of S4unah2s4epa the amount is a hundred (cows) in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 9) vii. 15, 7. In the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 10) See n. 1. The word is not found in the Taittiri1ya. s4ata-da1ya again appears. The fixing of the price shows that already public opinion, and perhaps the royal authority, was in Rigvedic times diminishing the sphere of private revenge; on the other hand, the existence of the system shows how weak was the criminal authority of the king (cf. Dharma). Cf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 41, 672676; Bu7hler and von Schroeder, Festgruss an Roth, 44-52; Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, 78, 79; 14, 201 Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 402 Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 131, 132; Delbru7ck in Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 297.

वैरहत्य
वैर-हत्य,
 ‘manslaughter,’ is mentioned in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (xxx. 13) and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (i. 5, 9, 5). Cf. Vi1rahan.

वैराज्य

 See Ra1jya.

वैरूप
वैरूप,
 ‘descendant of Viru1pa,’ is the patronymic of As2t2a1dam2s2t2ra in the Pan5cavims4a Bra1hman2a (viii. 9, 21).

वैशन्त
वैशन्त
 is the name in the Rigveda 1) vii. 33, 2. of a prince whose offering Indra is said to have deserted for that of Suda1s through the aid of the Vasis2t2has. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. thinks that the name is Ves4anta, and that he was a priest of the Pr2thu-Pars4us; Griffith 3) Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 24, n. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 130. says that probably a river is meant, but neither of these views is plausible.

वैशंपायन
वैशंपायन,
 ‘descendant of Vis4am2pa,’ is the name of a teacher, famous later, but in the earlier Vedic literature known only to the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka (i. 7, 5) and the Gr2hya Su1tras.

वैशालेय
वै-शालेय,
 ‘descendant of Vis4a1la,’ is the patronymic of the mythic Taks2aka in the Atharvaveda (viii. 10, 29).

वैशीपुत्र
वैशी-पुत्र,
 ‘the son of a Vais4ya wife,’ is mentioned in the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 7, 3; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2. 

वैश्य
वैश्य
 denotes a man, not so much of the people, as of the subject class, distinct from the ruling noble (Ks2atriya) and the Bra1hman2a, the higher strata of the A1ryan community on the one side, and from the aboriginal S4u1dra on the other. The name is first found in the Purus2a-su1kta (‘hymn of man’) in the Rigveda, 1) x. 90, 12. and then frequently from the Atharvaveda 2) v. 17. 9. onwards, 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5. etc. See Varn2a. sometimes in the form of Vis4ya. 4) Av. vi. 13, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 48, etc. The Vais4ya plays singularly little part in Vedic literature, which has much to say of Ks2atriya and Brahmin. His characteristics are admirably summed up in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 5) vii. 29. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 439. in the adjectives anyasya bali-kr2t, ‘tributary to another’; anyasya1dya, ‘to be lived upon by another’; and yatha1ka1majyeyah2, ‘to be oppressed at will.’ He was unquestionably taxed by the king (Ra1jan), who no doubt assigned to his retinue the right of support by the people, so that the Ks2atriyas grew more and more to depend on the services rendered to them by the Vais4yas. But the Vais4ya was not a slave: he could not be killed by the king or anyone else without the slayer incurring risk and the payment of a wergeld (Vaira), which even in the Brahmin books extends to 100 cows for a Vais4ya. Moreover, though the Vais4ya could be expelled by the king at pleasure, he cannot be said to have been without property in his land. Hopkins 6) India, Old and New, 222 et seq. thinks it is absurd to suppose that he could really be a landowner when he was subject to removal at will, but this is to ignore the fact that normally the king could not remove the landowner, and that kings were ultimately dependent on the people, as the tales of exiled kings show. On the other hand, Hopkins 7) Op. cit., 210 et seq. is clearly right in holding that the Vais4ya was really an agriculturist, and that Vedic society was not merely a landholding aristocracy, superimposed upon an agricultural aboriginal stock, as Baden Powell 8) Indian Village Community, 190 et seq. urged. Without ignoring the possibility that the Dravidians were agriculturists, there is no reason to deny that the A1ryans were so likewise, and the goad of the plougher was the mark of a Vais4ya in life 9) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 1. and in death. 10) Kaus4ika Su1tra, lxxx. It would be absurd to suppose that the A1ryan Vais4yas did not engage in industry and commerce (cf. Pan2i, Van2ij), but pastoral pursuits and agriculture must have been their normal occupations. In war the Vais4yas must have formed the bulk of the force under the Ks2atriya leaders (see Ks2atriya). But like the Homeric commoners, the Vais4yas may well have done little of the serious fighting, being probably ill-provided with either body armour or offensive weapons. That the Vais4yas were engaged in the intellectual life of the day is unlikely; nor is there any tradition, corresponding to that regarding the Ks2atriyas, of their having taken part in the evolution of the doctrine of Brahman, the great philosophic achievement of the age. The aim of the Vais4ya's ambition was, according to the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 11) ii. 5, 4, 4. to become a Gra1man2i1, or village headman, a post probably conferred by the king on wealthy Vais4yas, of whom no doubt there were many. It is impossible to say if in Vedic times a Vais4ya could attain to nobility or become a Brahmin. No instance can safely be quoted in support of such a view, 12) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 55 et seq., argues to the contrarya from Buddhist evidence; but this has no cogency for the Vedic period, and much, if not all, of it is hardly in point as concerns this issue. though such changes of status may have taken place (see Ks2atriya and Varn2a). It is denied by Fick 13) Die sociale Gliederung, 163, et seq. that the Vais4yas were ever a caste, and the denial is certainly based on good grounds if it is held that a caste means a body within which marriage is essential, and which follows a hereditary occupation (cf. Varn2a). But it would be wrong 14) Cf. Indian Empire, 1, 347. to suppose that the term Vais4ya was merely applied by theorists to the people who were not nobles or priests. It must have been an early appellation of a definite class which was separate from the other classes, and properly to be compared with them. Moreover, though there were differences among Vais4yas, there were equally differences among Ks2atriyas and Bra1hmanas, and it is impossible to deny the Vais4yas' claim to be reckoned a class or caste it the other two are such, though at the present day things are different. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 213 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 1 et seq.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 7 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 242, 243; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 76 et seq. (for the Epic Vais4ya).

वैश्वामित्र
वैश्वा-मित्र,
 ‘descendant of Vis4va1mitra,’ is the term by which that famous priest's line is referred to in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (vii. 17 et seq.).

वैष्ठपुरेय
वैष्ठ-पुरेय,
 ‘descendant of Vis2t2hapura,’ is the name of a teacher in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad in the Ma1dhyam2dina recension (ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 25). He was a pupil of S4a1n2d2ilya and Rauhin2a1yana.

व्यछ
व्यछ
 in go-vyacha, the name of one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 18; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 16, 1. Cf. Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 4. is of uncertain signification. According to Sa1yan2a, 2) On Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. the compound denotes a ‘driver out of cows.’ Perhaps it means a ‘tormentor of cows,’ as the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it. Weber 3) Indische Streifen, 1, 82, n. 11. This interpretation is supported by the use of the word in the Ka1t2haka, where it replaces the Govikartana of other texts, See Ratnin (p. 200). renders it as ‘knacker of cows,’ Eggeling as ‘one who approaches cows.’ ^4 Sacred Books of the East, 44, 416.

व्यद्वर
व्य्-अद्वर,
 1) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 4, 1, 27. Cf. Av. vi. 50, 2. Vy-advari1, 2) Av. iii. 28, 2, where a worm is certainly not meant. are the names of a ‘gnawing’ (ad, ‘eat’) animal in the Atharvaveda and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. Cf. also Vyadhvara, which the St. Petersburg Dictionary would read throughout. 

व्यध्वर
व्यध्वर,
 ‘perforating,’ designates a worm in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 31, 4. where there seems to be no good reason to alter the reading to Vyadvara, though Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 74. thinks that it may rather be connected with vi-adhvan 3) This would mean ‘diverging from the road,’ ‘devious.’ than with the root vyadh, ‘pierce.’ 4) The Padapa1t2ha analyzes the word as vi-adhvara. The term occurs with Mas4aka, ‘fly,’ in the Hiran2yakes4i Gr2hya Su1tra, 5) ii. 16, 3. and perhaps also in another passage of the Atharvaveda, 6) vi. 50, 3. where, however, both Whitney 7) Op. cit., 318, Cf. 135. Cf. also Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 316, 361, 487; Lanman in Whitney, op. cit., 318. and Shan3kar Pan2d2it read Vyadvara.

व्यल्कशा
व्यल्कशा
 is the name of a plant in the Rigveda. 1) x. 16, 13. Cf. Zimmer Altindisches Leben, 70.

व्यश्व
व्य्-अश्व
 is the name of a R2s2i, a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, 1) Rv. i. 112, 15. mentioned in several hymns of the eighth Man2d2ala, 2) viii. 23, 16. 23; 24, 22; 26, 9. which may have been the composition of a descendant of his, Vis4vamanas. In two other passages 3) Rv. viii. 9, 10; ix. 65, 7. he is referred to only as a R2s2i of the past, and Oldenberg 4) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla1ndischen Gesellschaft 42, 217. points out that none of his own work appears in the Sam2hita1. The Rigveda also mentions 5) Rv. viii. 24, 28. the Vyas4vas, with whom Ludwig 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 106. is inclined to connect Vas4a As4vya. An A1n3girasa Vyas4va occurs as a seer of Sa1mans or Chants in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 7) xiv. 10. 9.

व्यष्टि
व्य्-अष्टि
 is the name of a mythical teacher in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) iv. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 Ma1dhyam2dina. 

व्याख्यान
व्या-ख्यान
 in one passage of the Satapatha Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 6, 2, 7. clearly denotes a ‘narrative’ merely--viz., that of the dispute of Kadru1 and Suparn2i1. In other passages 2) vi. 1, 27. 33; vii. 2, 4, 28. the word means simply ‘commentary.’ In the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 3) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6 (Ma1dhyam2dina = 2 Ka1n2va); 5, 11. used in the plural, it signifies a species of writing, apparently ‘commentaries,’ though its exact relation to Anuvya1khya1na must remain obscure. Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 21, 34. thinks that the Vya1khya1nas were forms of narrative like Anva1khya1na and Anuvya1khya1na.

व्याघ्र
व्याघ्र,
 ‘tiger,’ is never found in the Rigveda, but frequently occurs in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 3, 1; 36, 6; vi. 38, 1; 103, 3; 140, 1; xii. 1, 49; 2, 43; xix. 46, 5; 49, 4. as well as the lion This fact is legitimately regarded as an indication that the Atharvaveda belongs to a period when the Vedic Indian had approached and entered the territory of Bengal. Later, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 5, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 9; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 9; xix. 10; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 5, 3 S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 7, 1, 8; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 9, 3; 10, 2, etc. also, mention of the tiger is quite common. The Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) v. 4, 10, 5. preserves a reference to the danger of waking a sleeping tiger. The destructive character of the animal is often alluded to, 4) Cf. Av. iv. 36, 6; viii. 5, 11, and see S4as4ayu. the man-eater (purus2a1d) 5) Av. xii. 1, 49. being also mentioned. Like the lion, the tiger passes as a symbol of strength. 6) Av. iv. 8, 4, 7. Cf. Ya1ska, Nirukta, iii. 18. This idea is illustrated by the fact that the king at the Ra1jasu1ya (‘royal consecration’) steps 7) Av. iv. 8, 4. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 92. He does not wear the skin, as Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 79, says. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities 249, 250. on a tiger's skin to win himself the strength of the animal. Cf. also S4a1rdu1la, Petva.

 is a false reading in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (v. 16, 1) for Vaiya1ghrapadya. 

व्याधि
व्याधि,
 ‘disease,’ occurs several times in Vedic literature. 1) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 10, 3; Sad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 4; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 4, 8. The specific diseases are dealt with under the separate names, but the Vedic texts also mention innumerable bodily defects. The list of victims 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 10. 17. 21; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 6, 1; 14, 1; 17, 1. at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) includes a ‘dwarf’ (va1mana, kubja), a ‘bald’ person (khalati), 3) Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 3, 6, 5. a ‘blind’ man (andha), 4) Cf. Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 2, 9; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 1, 9; 13, 2; viii. 4, 2; 9, 1; 10, 1; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 3. a ‘deaf’ man (badhira), 5) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 2, 10; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 1, 10; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, loc. cit. a ‘dumb’ man (mu1ka), 6) Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, loc. cit. a ‘fat’ man (pi1van), a ‘leper’ (sidhmala, kila1sa), 7) Kila1sa also in Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11. etc. a ‘yellow-eyed’ man (hary-aks2a), a ‘tawny-eyed’ man (pin3ga1ks2a), a ‘cripple’ (pi1t2ha-sarpin), a ‘lame’ man (sra1ma), a ‘sleepless’ man (ja1garan2a), a ‘sleepy’ man (svapana), one 8) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 22; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 19, 1, where are added the man who winks too much (ati-mirmira), has too prominent teeth (ati-dantura) or too small teeth (ati-kirit2a). and who stares excessively (ati-memis2a), Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 84, n. 4. ‘too tall’ (ati-di1rgha), one ‘too short’ (ati-hrasva), one ‘too stout’ (ati-stha1la or aty-am2sala), one ‘too thin’ (ati-kr2s4a), one ‘too white’ (ati-s4ukla), one ‘too dark’ (ati-kr2s2n2a), one ‘too bald’ (ati-kulva), and one ‘too hairy’ (ati-lomas4a). In the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 9) iv. 1, 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 9. Cf. Av. vii. 65, 3. the man with bad nails and the man with brown teeth are mentioned along with sinners like the Didhis2u1pati. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 10) xiii. 3, 6, 5. See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 323, n. mentions a ‘white-spotted (s4ukla), bald-headed man, with projecting teeth (viklidha) and reddish-brown eyes.’ Interesting is Zimmer's 11) Altindisches Leben, 428. suggestion that kirmira found in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 12) xxx. 21. means ‘spotty’ as an intermixture of races, but it is only a conjecture, apparently based on a supposed connexion of the word with kr2, ‘mix.’ In the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 13) xxx. 15, especially avija1ta1 and vijarjara1, beside avatoka1 and parya1yin2i1; ati1tvari1 and atis2kadvari1 are also possibly so to be understood. Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 80. and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 14) iii. 4, 11, 1, where apaskadvari1 and parya1rin2i1 are read. various epithets are applied to women, some of which seem to denote disease, and in the Atharvaveda 15) i. 18, 4. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 314, understands the hymn as referring to the domestic cat, but this lacks plausibility. The sense of the other epithets there occurring is quite obscure. the feminine adjectives, ‘antelope-footed’ (r2s4ya-padi1) and ‘bulltoothed’ (vr2s2a-dati1), probably refer to bodily defects.

व्यान

 in the Sam2hita1s 1) Av. vi. 137, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 1, 4; 2, 5, 1, etc. and the Bra1hman2as 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 2, 3, 1. 2; i. 2, 5, 14; vii. 1, 1, 37, where the scholiast equates it to 4 Aratnis or cubits (while the scholiast on A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, ix. 1, 9, regards it as equal to 5 Aratnis). According to the S4ulva Su1tra of Baudha1yana, the Aratni equals 24 an3gula (= (3/4) inch). See Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatie Society, 1912, 231, 233, 234. denotes the ‘span’ of the outstretched arms as a measure of length. It may be estimated at six feet or equivalent to a fathom. 3) See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 309, n. 5.

व्यासपाराशर्य

 (‘descendant of Para1s4ara’) is the name of a mythical sage who in the Vedic period is found only as a pupil of Vis2vaksena in the Vam2s4a (list of teacheres) at the end of the Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a and in the late Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 1) i. 9, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 156; 4, 377; Indian Literature, 184, n. 199.

व्र
व्र,
 according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Bechtel, Nachrichten der ko7niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Go7ttingen, 1894, 393. means ‘troop’ in the Rigveda 2) i. 124, 8; 126, 5; iv. 1, 16; viii. 2, 6; x. 123, 2. He omits i. 121, 2, where Bo7litlingk, Dictionary, s.v., treats the word as a feminine (vra1). and the Atharvaveda. 3) ii. 1, 1, a confused passage, on which see Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 37, 38. Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 162. sees in the word (in the feminine form of vra1) a designation in one passage of the village host which formed part of the Vis4, and was composed of relations (su-bandhu). On the other hand, Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 121, 313 et seq. thinks that in all the passages Vra1 means ‘female,’ used either of animals 6) Rv. i. 121, 2; viii. 2, 6 (female elephants). or of women who go to the feast (Samana), 7) Rv. i. 124, 8. or courtezans (vis4ya1, ‘of the people’), 8) Rv. i. 126. 5. or, metaphorically, 9) Rv. iv. 1, 16; x. 123, 2; Av., loc. cit. the hymns compared with courtezans; these senses are perhaps adequate.

व्रज
व्रज
 denotes in the first instance, in the Rigveda, 1) Rv. ii. 38, 8; x. 26, 3, and perhaps 97, 10; 101, 8. Cf. Medha1tithi on Manu, iv. 45, and Maha1bha1rata, i. 41, 15, where go-vraja is equal to gava1m2 praca1ra1h2, ‘the pastures of the kine,’ in i. 40, 17. the place to which the cattle resort (from vraj, ‘go’), the ‘feeding ground’ to which the milk-giving animals go out 2) Rv. ii. 38, 8. in the morning from the village (Gra1ma), while the others stay in it all day and night. 3) Cf. Sa1yan2a on Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 18, 14. Secondarily it denotes the ‘herd’ 4) Rv. v. 35, 4; vii. 27, 1; 32, 10; viii. 46, 9; 51, 5. itself. This is Geldner's view, 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 282 et seq.; Rigreda, Glossar, 174. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 77. which seems clearly better than that of Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But cf. Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v. who regards Vraja as primarily the ‘enclosure’ (from vr2j), and only thence the ‘herd’; for the Vraja does not normally mean an ‘enclosure’ at all: the Vedic cattle were not stall-fed as a general rule. In some passages, however, ‘pen,’ 7) Av. iii. 11, 5; iv. 38, 7; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, ii. 16. Metaohorically, in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 4, 22, Ma1dhyam2dina, it is a pen with a bolt (sa1rgala) and with a palisade (sa-paris4raya). The sense of ‘pen’ is also possible in Rv. x. 97, 10; 101, 8, and is not radically opposed to it, for Vraja denotes the place where the cattle are fed, and can therefore be applied to the stall where they are during the night. Cf. Gos2t2ha. in others ‘stall,’ 8) Rv. x. 4, 2, where the ‘warm Vraja’ to which the cows resort is alluded to, and iv. 51, 2, where the Dawns open wide the doors of the Vraja of darkness; Taittiri1ya. Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 12, 2, where the Vraja is said to be made of As4vattha wood. The sense of ‘stall’ is probable in Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 25. is certainly meant. The word is often used in the myth of the robbing of the kine. 9) See Geldner, op. cit., 2, 283 et seq. It occasionally denotes a ‘cistern.’ 10) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, x. 4 = Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 11, 1 = Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 7.

Cf. ghr2tavrata, Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xviii. 2, 5. 6, and vrata-dugha1, the ‘cow that gives the Vrata milk,’ S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 2, 14; xiv. 3, 1, 34. etc. has the peculiar sense of the ‘milk’ used by one who is living on that beverage alone as a vow or penance.

 in the Rigveda 1) viii. 40, 6; Nirukta, i. 14; vi. 28. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 1, 3, etc. denotes a ‘creeping plant.’

व्राजपति
व्राज-पति
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 179, 2 = Av. vii. 72, 2. where it is said that comrades attend Indra, as the Kulapas the Vra1japati, when he goes about. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 171. thinks that this refers to the heads of families being subordinate in war to the village headman (Gra1man2i1), but Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 436. seems to be right in seeing merely the chieftain surrounded by the leading men, the family heads, not necessarily merely a village headman. Vra1ja alone occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 4) i. 16, 1. Cf. Whitney, op. cit., 17. adverbially in the sense of ‘in troops.’

व्राजबाहु
व्राज-बाहु
 is used in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a (ii. 9) of the ‘encompassing arms’ of death, Vra1ja here apparently meaning a ‘pen,’ like Vraja. Cf. Vis2t2ha1-vra1jin.

व्रात
व्रात
 is found in several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 163, 8; iii. 26, 2; v. 53, 11; ix. 14, 2 (perhaps an allusion to the five tribes); x. 34, 8. 12 (of dice). In x. 57, 5, the host of the living (ji1va vra1ta) is referred to. and later 2) Av. ii. 9, 2 (‘host of the living’); Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 10, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 25; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 9. 24; xvii. 1, 5. 12, etc. in the sense of ‘troop.’ In one passage of the Rigveda 3) v. 53, 11. Cf. iii. 26, 2, where s4ardha is not mentioned. the troops of the Maruts are referred to by three different terms--s4ardha, vra1ta, and gan2a. From this fact Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 162. has deduced that a Vedic host fought according to clan (Vis4), village (Gra1ma), and family, but this conclusion is hardly warranted, there being nothing to show that there is any intention to present a distinct series of divisions. It is not probable that the word ever has the technical sense of ‘guild,’ as Roth 5) In the St. Petersburg Dictionary, where this is taken to be the sense; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 9, 25; xvii. 1, 5, 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 25; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 10, 2. thinks. Cf. Vra1tapati.

व्रातपती
व्रात-पती,
 ‘lord of troops,’ is an epithet included in the names of Rudra in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s, 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 4, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 25. along with the epithet Gan2a-pati, ‘lord of groups.’ The exact sense is quite uncertain, but the term may allude to the chief of a band of robbers, as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 179. thinks.

व्रात्य
व्रात्य
 is included in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 8; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 5, 1. where, however, no further explanation of the name is given. Fuller information is furnished by the Atharvaveda, 2) xv. 1, 1 et seq. the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 3) xvii. 1-4. and the Su1tras. 4) Ka1tya1yana Srauta Su1tra, xii. 1; xxii. 4; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 6; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 5, 4-14. See Hillebrandt, Ritualliteratur, 139, 140. which describe at length a certain rite intended for the use of Vra1tyas. According to the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, there are four different kinds of ‘outcasts’--viz., the hi1na, who are merely described as ‘depressed’; those who have become outcasts for some sin (nindita); those who become outcasts at an early age, apparently by living among outcasts; and those old men who, being impotent (s4ama-ni1camed2hra), have gone to live with outcasts. The last three categories are by no means of the same importance as the first. The motive of the fourth is hard to understand: according to Ra1ja1ra1m Ra1m krishn2a Bha1gavat, 5) Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 19, 360. they were men who had enfeebled their constitutions by undue intercourse with women in the lands of the outcasts, and returned home in a debilitated state. But this is not stated in the text. It seems probable that the really important Vra1tyas were those referred to as hi1na, and that the other classes were only subsidiary. According to Ra1ja1ra1m, 6) Ibid., 359. there were two categories of the first class: (a) The depressed (hi1na), who were nonA1ryan; and (b) degraded A1ryans (gara-gir). This, however, is a mere guess, and devoid of probability. There seems to have been but one class of Vra1tyas. That they were non-A1ryan is not probable, for it is expressly said 7) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 1 that, though unconsecrated, they spoke the tongue of the consecrated: they were thus apparently A1ryans. This view is confirmed by the statement that ‘they call what is easy of utterance, difficult to utter’: probable they and already a somewhat Prakritic form of speech (cf. Va1c). The Su1tras mention their Arhants (‘saints’) and Yaudhas (‘warrioes’), corresponding to the Brahminical Bra1hman2a and Ks2atriya. Other particulars accord with the view that they were A1ryans outside the sphere of Brahmin culture. Thus they are said 8) Ibid., xvii. 1, 2. not to practise agriculture or commerce (an allusion to a nomadic life), not to observe the rules of Brahmacarya--i.e., the principle regulating the Brahminic order of life. They were also allowed to become members of the Brahminical community by performance of the ritual prescribed, which would hardly be so natural in the case of non-A1ryans. Some details are given of the life and dress of the Vra1tyas. Their principles were opposed to those of the Brahmins: they beat those unworthy of correction. 9) Ibid., xvii. 1, 14. Their leder (Gr2hapati) or householder wore a turbrn (Us2n2i1s2a), carried a whip (Pratoda), a kind of bow (Jya1hrod2a), was clothed in a black (kr2s2n2as4a) garment and two skins (Ajina), black and white (kr2s2n2a-valaks2a), and owned a rough vagon (Vipatha) covered with planks (phalaka1sti1rn2a). The others, 10) Ibid., xvii. 1, 15. The exact sense of the passages is obscure; and was, as La1t2ya1yana shows, already obscure in his time and earlier; the translations given are all vague. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 32 et seq.; Indian Literature, 67, 68; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 31, 32; Ra1ja1ra1m, loc. cit. subordinate to the leader, had garments with fringes of red (valu1ka1nta1ni da1matu1s2a1n2i), two fringes on each, skins folded double (dvis2am2hita1ny ajina1ni), and sandals (Upa1nah). The leader wore also an ornament (Nis2ka) of silver, which Ra1ja1ra1m 11) Op. cit., 361. converts into a silver coinage. The Vra1tyas, on becoming consecrated, were expected to hand over their goods to the priest. Many other details are given in the Su1tras (e.g., that the shoes or sandals were of variegated black hue and pointed), but these are not authenticated by the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. The locality in which the Vra1tyas lived cannot be stated with certainty, but their nomad life 12) Which is indicated by their name, ‘belonging to a roving band’ (vra1ta), ‘vagrant.’ suggests the western tribes beyond the Sarasvati1. But they may equally well have been in the east: this possibility is so far supported by the fact that the Su1tras make the Brahmin receiving the gift of the Vra1tya's outfit an inhabitant of Magadha. The Atharvaveda 13) See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 770 et seq., with Lanman's additions. does not help, for it treats the Vra1tya in so mystical a way that he is represented as being in all the quacters. Indeed, Roth 14) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. believed that it was here not a case of the Vra1tya of the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a at all, but of a glorification of the Vra1tya as the type of the pious vagrant or wandering religious mendicant (Parivra1jaka). This view is clearly wrong, as the occurrence of the words us2n2i1sa, vipatha, and pratoaa shows. It is probable that the 15th Book of the Atharvaveda, which deals with the Vra1tya, and is of a mystical character, exalts the converted Vra1tya as a type of the perfect Brahmica1rin, and, in so far, of the divinity. 15) Boomfield, Atharvaveda, 94.

Weber, Indische Studien, i. 33, 52, 445, n.; Indian Literature, 67, 78, 110112, 14, 146; Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 1, 130 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, xxvi et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 216. 

व्रीहि
व्रीहि,
 ‘rice,’ is never mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) To take dha1nya bi1ja in Rv. v. 53, 13, as ‘rice seeds’ is unnecessary and very improbable, nor is there better reason to see in dha1nya rasa in Av. ii. 26, 5. a ‘rice drink.’ but is frequently alluded to in the Atharvaveda 2) vi. 140, 2; viii. 7, 20; ix. 6, 14, etc. and later. 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 2, 10, 3, where it is said to ripen in autumn; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 6; xi. 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 10, 2; iv. 3, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 12; AitareyaBra1hman2a, ii. 8, 7; 11, 12; viii. 16, 3.4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 5, 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 22 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 3, 13 Ka1n2va); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 14, 3. Rice seems to be indigenous in the south-east of India: 4) ii. 3, 1, 3. Cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 1, 7, 3, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 4. 5, 6, etc. this fact accounts well for the absence of any mention of it in the Rigveda. Black and white rice is contrasted in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 5) i. 8, 10, 1. where also 6) Av. xi. 4, 13; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 43; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 10, 6, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 239. the distinctions of dark, swift-growing (a1s4u), and large rice (maha1-vri1hi) are found. Probably the swift-growing variety is that later known as s2as2t2ika, ‘ripening in sixty days.’ Vri1hi and Yava, ‘barley,’ are normally conjoined in the texts.^7 Cf. Pla1s4uka.

शंयु
शंयु
 is the name of a mythical son of Br2haspati. He is quoted as a teacher in the texts of the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 10, 1; v. 2, 6, 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 8, 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 9, 1, 24; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, i. 5, 2.

S4akat2i1, 2) Rv. x. 146, 3; Sad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iv. 7. are rare words in the older literature for a ‘cart.’ The creaking of a cart is referred to in the Rigveda 2) Rv. x. 146, 3; Sad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iv. 7. as like the sound heard by night in the forest. 

शकधूम
शक-धूम
 is found in one hymn of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 128, 1, 3. 4, and in the Naks2atra Kalpa. where it is celebrated as the king of the asterisms. The word seems to mean the ‘smoke of (burning) cow-dung,’ or else the ‘smoke (rising) from (fresh) cow-dung’: it may well be, as Weber 2) Omina and Portenta, 363; Indische Studien, 5, 257; 10, 65; Naxatra, 2, 272, n.; 293. thinks, that this was deemed to be significant of the weather. Bloomfield, 3) American Journal of Philology, 7, 484 et seq.; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, cxxxiii; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 532, 533. however, considers that the word is to be rendered as ‘weather prophet,’ that is, one who foretells the weather by means of the smoke of a fire. Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda. 377, 378. objects to this view with reason. It is not at all improbable that, as Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 353; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritnal, 175, n. 3. believed, an asterism of some sort is meant, probably the ‘milky way.’

 (‘purified by cow-dung’) is the name, apparently, of a prince, in one hymn of the Rigveda (x. 132, 5).

शकंभर
शकं-भर,
 ‘bearer of dung,’ is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 22. 4. where the sense is doubtful. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 510. and Grill 3) Hundert Lieder^2, 154. see in it a tribal name, Bloomfield 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 445, 446. the personification of excessive evacuation (diarrhœa), while Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 259. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 253. considers that it may refer to the Maha1vr2s2as, despised as having to collect dung for fuel in the absence of wood in their country.

शका
शका
 is the name of one of the victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 12, 1; 18, 1; Maitra1yan2i Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 13; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 32. It is uncer tain whether a kind of bird 2) Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. or fly, 3) Sa1yan2a on Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 12, 1; 18, 1. or long-eared beast 4) Sa1yan2a on Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 12, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. is intended.

शकुन
शकुन,
 ‘bird,’ is mentioned frequently in the Rigveda 1) iv. 26, 6; ix. 85, 11; 86, 13; 107, 20; 112, 2; x. 68, 7; 106, 3; 123, 6; 165. 2. and later. 2) Av. xii. 1, 51; 3, 13; xx. 127, 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 6, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvii. 53, etc. It usually denotes a large bird, 3) Cf. Av. xi. 2, 24, as compared with Vayas; Nirukta, iii. 18. or a bird which gives omens. 4) Cf. Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, vii. 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Upanis2ad, vi. 34, etc. Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 430. compares  which also is a bird of omen.

शकुनि
शकुनि,
 ‘bird,’ is used practically like S4akuna, but with a much clearer reference to divination. It was smaller than the S4yena or Suparn2a, 1) Rv. ii. 42, 2. gave signs, 2) Rv. ii. 42, 1; 43, 3. and foretold ill-luck. 3) Av. x. 3, 6. When it is mentioned 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 19, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 40; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 21. in the list of sacrificial victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), a special species must be meant: later the falcon is so called, but the ‘raven’ may be intended; the commentator on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 thinks that it is the ‘crow.’ It is mentioned several times elsewhere. 5) Av. ii. 25, 2; vii. 64, 1; xi. 9, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxv. 7; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 15, 12; iv. 7, 3; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 1, 31; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 8, 2, etc. Cf.

शकुन्तला
शकुन्तला
 is the name of an Apsaras who bore Bharata, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) xiii. 5, 4, 13. at Na1d2apit. Weber 2) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 6. doubtfully reads the latter word as Na1d2apiti1, an epithet of S4akuntala1.

 1) Used only in nominative and accusative: Rv. i. 161, 10; Av. xii. 4, 9; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 19, 3, etc. S4akan, 2) In the oblique cases S4akan is the base, Av. xii. 4, 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 7, 23, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236. denotes ‘dung’ in the Rigveda and later. It is clear that the value of manure was early appreciated (see Kari1s2a). For the use of the smoke of dung or of a dung fire for prognosticating the weather, see S4akadhu1ma.

शक्ति
1. S4akti is said in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 390 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 47). to have been the son of Vasis2t2ha, and to have been cast into the fire by the Vis4va1mitras. According to S2ad2gurus4is2ya, 2) Sarva1nukraman2i1, ed. Macdonell, p. 107, and on Rv. vii. 32. who appears to follow the S4a1t2ya1yanaka, 3) Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 159, n. 3. the story of S4akti is as follows: Vis4va1mitra, being defeated in a contest by S4akti, had recourse to Jamadagni, who taught him the Sasarpari1; later he revenged himself on S4akti by having him burnt in the forest. The Br2haddevata1 4) iv. 112 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. relates the first part of the tale only. Geldner 5) Op. cit., 2, 159 et seq.; more doubtfully, Rigveda, Kommentar, 89. sees in the Rigveda 6) iii. 53, 22. a description of the death struggle of S4akti, but this interpretation is more than doubtful. 7) Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 254.

शक्तीआङ्गिरस

शक्वरी
शक्वरी,
 fem. plur., denotes the S4akvari1 verses, known also as the Maha1na1mni1 verses, to which the S4a1kvara Sa1man (chant) is sung. This sense seems to occur in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 33, 4; x. 71, 14; Nirukta, i. 8. and is certain later. 2) Av. xiii. 1, 5; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 8, 5; 6, 2, 3; iii. 4, 4, 1; v. 4, 12, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvi. 4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, x. 6, 5; xii. 13, 12; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 5, 11; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 1, 1; 9, 2, 17, etc. Cf.

शङ्ख
1. S4an3kha in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 10, 1. See Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 161. with the epithet Kr2s4ana, denotes a pearl-shell used as an amulet. In the later literature 2) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 4, 9; iv. 5, 10. it denotes a ‘shell’ or ‘conch’ used for blowing as a wind instrument.

To interpret the expression as ‘lord of a hundred gods,’ as does the commentary on the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, is obviously impossible. It seems clear that there is a reference to an analogous human functionary--viz., the lord of a hundred villages, known in the later law 3) See Foy, Die ko7nigliche Gewalt, 74. --who was probably at once a judicial deputy of the sovereign and a revenue collector, an ancient magistrate and collector.

He was clearly a Bharata. He is also alluded to in the Atharvaveda. 3) i. 35. 1 = Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 52, in connexion with the Da1ks2a1yan2as.

शत्रिआग्निवेशि

He supersedes his elder brother Deva1pi as king of the Kurus. When his improper deed brings on a prolonged drought in his realm, he is compelled to ask his brother to assume the kingship; Deva1pi, however, refuses, but instead performs a sacrifice which produces rain. Sieg 3) Loc. cit. endeavours to trace this story in the Rigveda, 4) x. 98. but all that is there stated is that Deva1pi A1rs2t2is2en2a obtained (no doubt as priest) rain for S4am2tanu (no doubt a king). There is no hint of relationship at all.

शपथ
शपथ
 in the Rigveda 1) x. 87, 15; Nirukta, vii. 3. and later 2) Av. iii. 9, 5; iv. 9, 5; 18, 7; 19, 7. etc. denotes a ‘curse,’ not an ‘oath,’ as a judicial process. But that an oath of such a kind was possible as it was later, 2) Av. iii. 9, 5; iv. 9, 5; 18, 7; 19, 7. etc. is shown by at least one passage of the Rigveda, 3) vii. 104, 15. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 326, 327. where the speaker, possibly Vasis2t2ha, imprecates death on himself if he is a wizard, and death on his foes if he is not.

शफ
1. S4apha, ‘hoof,’ comes to be used to denote the fraction ‘one-eighth,’ because of the divided hoofs of the cow, just as Pa1da, the ‘foot’ of a quadruped, also means a ‘quarter.’ This sense in found as early as the Rigveda, 1) viii. 47, 17. and is not rare later. 2) Av. vi. 46, 3; xix. 57, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 10, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 3, 3, etc. Cf.

Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 458, n. 4; 476. is the name (used in the dual) of a wooden implement, acting like a pair of tongs, for lifting an iron pot from the fire. It is probably so called because it resembled a hoof in being divided. 

शफक
शफक
 is the name of some plant in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 34, 5. It is also mentioned in the A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, 2) ix. 14, 14. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 138; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda 207. where it seems to denote an edible water plant or fruit, perhaps a water nut. It may be so called from its leaves being shaped like hoofs (S4apha).

शफाल
शफाल
 is the name of R2tuparn2a's kingdom in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Sa1tra. 1) xx. 12. Cf. Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 21, 36.

शमी
शमी
 is the name of a tree in the Atharvaveda 1) Av. vi. 11, 1; 30, 2, 3. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 9, 6; 4, 7, 4 (for the lower aran2i1); Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvi. 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 3, 11 et seq.; 6, 4, 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 5, 2, 12; ix. 2, 3, 37, etc. It is described in the Atharvaveda 3) Av. vi. 30, 2. 3. as destructive to the hair, 4) In the Dhanvantari1ya Nighan2t2u, p. 188 (ed. Poona), the S4ami1 and its fruit are said to destroy the hair. as producing intoxication, and as broad-leaved. These characteristics are totally wanting in the two trees, Prosopis spicigera or Mimosa suma, with which the S4ami1 is usually identified. 5) See Roth in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 302. From the soft wood of the S4ami1 was formed the lower of the two sticks (aran2i1) used for kindling the sacred fire, 6) Av. vi. 11, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 1, 15; Cf. 13; iii. 4, 1, 22; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 1, 9, 6; 4, 7, 4. the upper one (the drill) being of As4vattha.

शम्बर
शम्बर
 is the name of an enemy of Indra in the Rigveda. 1) i. 51, 6; 54, 4; 59, 6; 101, 2; 103, 8; 112, 14; 130, 7; ii. 12, 11; 14, 6; 19, 6; iv. 26, 3; 30, 14; vi. 18, 8; 26, 5; 31, 4; 43, 1; 47, 2. 21; vii. 18, 20; 99, 5. He is mentioned along with S4us2n2a, Pipru, and Varcin, being in one passage called a Da1sa, son of Kulitara. 2) Rv. vi. 26, 5. In another passage 3) Rv. vii. 18, 20. he is said to have deemed himself a godling (devaka). His forts, ninety, 4) Rv. i. 130, 7. ninety-nine, 5) Rv. ii. 19, 6. or a hundred 6) Rv. ii. 14, 6. in number, are alluded to, the word itself in the neuter plural once 7) Rv. ii. 24, 2. meaning the ‘forts of S4ambara.’ His great foe was Divoda1sa Atithigva, who won victories over him by Indra's aid. 8) Rv. i. 51, 6; 130, 7; ii. 19, 6; iv. 26, 3, etc. It is impossible to say with certainty whether S4ambara was a real person or not. Hillebrandt 9) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 103, 108; 3, 273. is strongly in favour of the theory that he was a real chief as enemy of Divoda1sa: he relies on the statistics 10) Seven times in Man2d2ala i; four in ii; two in iv; six in vi; two in vii. These references show prima10 facis greater reality in Man2d2ala vi than elsewhere. The references in ii. are certainly all of the mythical kind, and those in vii are of much the same sort. of the mention of the name to show that, where as he was conceived as a real foe in the hymns of the time of Divoda1sa, later texts, like those of the seventh Man2d2ala, make him into a demon, as a result of the change of scene from Arachosia to India. As a matter of fact, apart from this theory, S4ambara was quite possibly an aboriginal enemy in India, living in the mountains. 11) Rv. i. 130, 7; iv. 30, 14; vi. 26, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 177; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 161; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 210; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 178. 

शम्बिन्
शम्बिन्,
 a word occurring only once, appears to mean ‘ferryman’ in the Atharvaveda (ix. 2, 6). The literal sense is probably ‘pole-man’ (from s4amba, a word of doubtful signification found in the Rigveda, x. 42, 7).

शंमदाङ्गिरस

 (‘descendant of An3giras’) is the name of the seer of a Sa1man or Chant in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xv. 5, 11). Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic. 2, 160.

Cf. xi. 1, 6; xv. 7, 6; Grierson, Bihar Pcasant Life, 194, and illustration, p. 33; Cuningham, The Stu1pa of Bharhut, Plate xxviii.; Caland and Henry, L'Agnis2t2oma, 49. The S4amya1 was also used as a measure of length. 6) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 6, 2. According to the commentary on Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, v. 3, 20, the length was 32 An3gulas, or fingerbreadths This would be equivalent to 2 feet: cf. Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1912, 232.

Some sort of bird is meant according to Roth, 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95. but the commentator on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 equates the word with Kr2kala1sa, ‘chameleon.’

2. S4ara Arcatka (‘descendant of R2catka’) is the name of a R2s2i in the Rigveda. 1) i. 116, 22; cf. perhaps. i. 112, 16; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 103, Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 150. It is very doubtful, however, whether A1rcatka is really a patronymic.

शरशौरदेव्य
3. S4ara S4aura-devya (‘descendant of S4u1radeva’) is the name of a generous prince in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 70, 13-15. who gave one calf to three singers. That this Da1nastuti (‘praise of gifts’) is ironical seems certain. 2) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 5-7; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163; 5. 175.

शरभ
1. S4arabha is the name of some wild animal in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 5, 9. Cf. S4alabha. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 10, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 51; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 8, 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 3, 9, etc. In the classical literature it is a fabulous, eight-legged beast, dwelling in the snowy mountains, a foe of lions and elephants: the commentator Mahi1dhara sees this sense, but without reason, in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1. The animal is spoken of as akin to the goat; 3) Av., loc. cit.; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 52, n. 1, accepts the traditional rendering. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 89. it was probably a kind of deer.

शरीर
शरीर,
 ‘body,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in Vedic literature. 1) Rv. i. 32, 10; x. 16, 1, etc.; Av. v. 9, 7; xviii. 3, 9, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 55; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 7, 2, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 13; 14, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 1, 4, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 1, 8. The interest of the Vedic Indians seems early to have been attracted to the consideration of questions connected with the anatomy of the body. Thus a hymn of the Atharvaveda 2) x. 2. enumerates many parts of the body with some approach to accuracy and orderly arrangement. 3) Cf. Hoernle, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 10-12; Osteology, 109-111, 242. It mentions the heels (pa1rs2n2i1), the flesh (ma1m2sa), the ankle-bones (gulphau), the fingers (an3guli1h2), the apertures (kha), the two metatarsi (uchlakau), the tarsus (pratis2t2ha1), the two knee-caps (as2t2hi1vantau), the two legs (jan3ghe), the two knee-joints (ja1nunoh2 sandhi1). Then comes above the two kness (ja1nu1) the foursided (catus2t2aya), pliant (s4ithira) trunk (kabandha). The two hips (s4ron2i1) and the two thighs (a1ru1) are the props of the frame (kusindha). Next come the breast-bone (uras), the cervical cartilages (gri1va1h2), the two breast pieces (stanau), the two shoulder-blades (kaphod2au), the neck-bones (skandhau), and the backbones (pr2s2t2i1h2), the collar-bones (am2sau), the arms (ba1hu1), the seven apertures in the head (sapta kha1ni s4i1rs2an2i), the ears (karn2au), the nostrils (na1sike), the eyes (caks2an2i1), the mouth (mukha), the jaws (hanu1), the tongue (jihva1), the brain (mastis2ka), the forehead (lala1t2a), the facial bone (kaka1t2ika1), the cranium (kapa1la), and the structure of the jaws (citya1 hanvoh2). This system presents marked similarities with the later system of Caraka and Sus4ruta, 4) Osteology, 112. which render certain the names ascribed to the several terms by Hoernle. Kaphod2au, which is variously read in the manuscripts, 5) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 568. is rendered ‘collar-bone’ by Whitney, but ‘elbow’ in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Skandha in the plural regularly 6) Av. x. 7. 3 (where the Skandhas are compared with the Kr2ttika1s, probably because both were seven in number, but this is not certain); 9, 20; vi. 135, 1; xii. 5, 67; Hoernle, Journal, 1906, 918; 1907, 1, 2. denotes ‘neck-bones,’ or, more precisely, ‘cervical vertebræ,’ a part denoted also by us2n2iha1 in the plural. 7) Av. vi. 134, 1; Rv. vi. 163, 2= Av. ii. 33, 2; Av. ix. 8, 21; x. 10, 20.

See Hoernle, Journal, 1907. 2 et seq.; Whitney, op. cit., 548; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44. 164. n. 2. denotes not ‘rib,’ which is pars4u, 9) Av. ix. 7, 6, etc. but a transverse process of a vertebra, and so the vertebra itself, there being in the truncal portion of the spinal column seventeen vertebræ and thirty-four transverse processes. The vertebræ are also denoted by ki1kasa1 in the plural, 10) Av. ix. 7, 5; 8, 14. which sometimes 11) Av. xi. 8, 15. is limited to the upper portion of the vertebral column, sometimes 12) Av. ii. 33, 2; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 6, 2, 10. to the thoracic portion of the spine. Anu1ka also denotes the vertebral column, 13) Av. iv. 14, 8. Cf. ix. 8, 21 (the spine of the trunk). or more specially the lumbar 14) Av. ii. 33, 2. or thoracic 15) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 2, 4. 12. 14. Cf. the phrase i1s2c anu1kye, Av. xi. 3, 9, where the two shafts of a cart are compared with the transverse processes of a vertebra. portion of the spine; it is said in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 15) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 2, 4, 12. 14. Cf. the phrase i1s2c anu1kye, Av. xi. 3, 9, where the two shafts of a cart are compared with the transverse processes of a vertebra. that there are twenty transverse processes in the lumbar spine (udara) and thirty-two in the thoracic, which gives twenty-six vertebræ, the true number (but the modern division is seven cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, and two false--the sacrum and the coccyx). The vertebral column is also denoted by karu1kara, 16) Av. xi. 9, 8; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 124. which, however, is usually found in the plural 17) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 2, 4, 10, 14. denoting the transverse processes of the vertebræ, a sense expressed also by kunta1pa. 18) Ibid., xii. 2, 4, 12. Gri1va1, in the plural, denotes cervical vertebræ, the number seven being given by the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 19) Ibid. xii. 2, 4, 10. but usually 20) Rv. vi. 163, 2 = Av. ii. 33, 2; Av. vi. 134, 1; ix. 7, 3; x. 9, 20; xi. 8, 15; Hoernle, Journal, 1906, 916 et seq. the word simply means windpipe, or, more accurately, the cartilaginous rings under the skin. Jatru, also in the plural, denotes the cervical cartilages, 21) Rv. vii. 1, 12 = Av. xiv. 2, 12. or possibly the costal cartilages, which are certainly so called in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 22) xii. 2, 4, 11. Cf. vii. 6, 2, 10; Hoernle, Journal, 1906, 922 et seq. where their number is given as eight.

In viii. 6, 5, it denotes vulva: Hoernle, 16-18. seems to denote the pubic bone or arch rather than the ‘buttocks’ or ‘fundament,’ as Whitney 24) Loc. cit. takes it. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 25) x. 5, 4, 12; xii. 3, 2, 3, 4; Hoernle, Osteology, 238, 239, and the criticism in 106-109, which shows how far removed the Satapatha Bra1hman2a is from a scientific system. Cf. Keith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 62, 135 et seq. the number of bones in the the human body is given as 360. The number of the bones of the head and trunk are given in another passage 26) xii. 2, 4, 9-14; Hoernle, Osteology, 240. as follows: The head is threefold, consisting of skin (tvac), bone (asthi), brain (matis2ka); the neck has 15 bones: 14 transverse processes (karu1kara) and the strength (vi1rya)--i.e., the bone of the centre regarded as one--as the 15th; the breast has 17: 16 cervical cartilages (jatru), and the sternum (uras) as the 17th; the abdominal portion of the spine has 21: 20 trans verse processes (kunta1pa), and the abdominal portion (udara) as the 21st; the two sides have 27: 26 ribs (pars4u), and the two sides as the 27th; the thoracic portion of the spine (anu1ka) has 33: 32 transverse processes, and the thoracic portion as 33rd. There are several enumerations of the parts of the body, not merely of the skeleton, in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 27) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 81-93; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 9; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxviii. 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 4. They include the hair (loma1ni), skin (tvac), flesh (ma1m2sa), bone (asthi), marrow (majjan), liver (yakr2t), lungs (kloman), kidneys (matasne), gall (pitta), entrails (a1ntra1n2i), bowels (guda1h2), spleen (pli1han), navel (na1bhi), belly (udara), rectum (vanis2t2hu), womb (yoni), penis (pla1s4i and s4epa), face (mukha), head (s4iras), tongue (jihva1), mouth (a1san), rump (pa1yu), leech (va1la), eye (caks2us), eyelashes (paks2ma1n2i), eyebrows (uta1ni), nose (nas), breath (vya1na), nose-hairs (nasya1ni), ears (karn2au), brows (bhru1), body or trunk (a1tman), waist (upastha), hair on the face (s4mas4ru1n2i), and on the head (kes4a1h2). Another enumeration 28) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 5-13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxviii. 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 5. gives s4iras, mukha, kes4a1h2, s4mas4ru1n2i, pra1n2a (breath), caks2us, s4rotra (ear), jihva1, va1c (speech), manas (mind), an3guli1h2, an3ga1ni (limbs), ba1hu1, hastau (hands), karn2au, a1tma1, uras (sternum), pr2s2t2i1h2 (vertebræ), udara, am2sau, gri1va1h2, s4ron2i1, u1ru1, aratni1 (elbows), ja1nu1ni, na1bhi, pa1yu, bhasat (fundament), a1n2d2au (testicles), pasas (membrum virile), jan3gha1, pad (foot), loma1ni, tvac, ma1m2sa, asthi, majjan. Another set of names 29) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxix. 8. 9. 10. includes vanis2t2hu, puri1tat (pericardium), loma1ni, tvac, lohita (blood), medas (fat), ma1m2sa1ni, sna1va1ni (sinews), asthi1ni, majja1nah2, retas (semen), pa1yu, kos4ya (flesh near the heart), pa1rs4vya (intercostal flesh), etc. The bones of the skeleton of the horse are enumerated in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 30) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxv. 1-9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 15. Cf. Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 1. In the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 31) i. 2, 2. the human body is regarded as made up of one hundred and one items; there are four parts, each of twenty-five members, with the trunk as one hundred and first. In the two upper parts there are five four-jointed 32) This is contrary to fact: Hoernle, Osteology, 122, 123. fingers, two kaks2asi1 (of uncertain meaning), 33) Perhaps the armpit regarded as in some way double; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 175. the arm (dos), the collar-bone (aks2a), and the shoulder-blade (am2sa-phalaka). In the two lower portions there are five four-jointed toes, the thigh, the leg, and three articulations, according to Sa1yan2a's commentary. The S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 34) ii. 2. enumerates three bones in the head, 35) Cf. Hoernle, Osteology, 172 et seq.; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 2, 4, 9. three joints (parva1n2i) in the neck, 36) ii. 3, See Keith, S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 9, n. 4. the collar-bone (aks2a), 37) ii. 4; Hoernle, Osteology, 202 et seq.; Keith, op. cit., 9, n. 5. three joints in the fingers, 38) ii. 5. Cf. n. 32. The later S4a1n3kha1yana here improves on the Aitareya osteology. and twenty-one transverse processes in the spine (anu1ka). 39) ii. 6. See Keith, op. cit., 10, n. 4. The Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 40) iii. 2, 9. enumerates four constituents in the head (pra1n2a, caks2us, s4rotra, va1c), but there are many variations, the number going up to twelve on one calculation. 41) See references in Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 185, 192, 195. The numbers vary and are fanciful, being of no scientific importance. In the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad 42) i. 7, 1. an enumeration is given consisting of carma (skin), ma1m2sa, sna1van, asthi, and majjan; and the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 43) vi. 29, 4. has loma1ni, ma1m2sa, tvac, asthi, majjan, and the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 44) iii. 2, 1. 2; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 1. 2. couples majja1nah2, sna1va1ni, and asthi1ni.

शर्ध्य

 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 119, 5. is taken by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. as perhaps denoting a part of the chariot. The sense is, however, quite uncertain.

शर्य
शर्य,
 1) i. 119, 10, where the sense is not certain. S4arya1, 2) i. 148, 4; x. 178, 3. Cf. Nirukta v. 4; x. 29. seem in the Rigveda to denote an ‘arrow.’ 3) As derived from 1. S4ara, and meaning literally ‘made from a reed.’ Perhaps, also, S4arya1 4) Rv. ix. 110, 5; x. 61, 3. and S4arya 5) Rv. ix. 14, 4; 68, 2. (neut.) mean the ‘wicker work’ in the Soma sieve, but the exact sense of the passages is doubtful. 6) Hillebrandt; Vedische Mythologie, 1, 52, takes s4arya1n2i in Rv. ix. 68, 2, as denoting the outer husk of the Soma plant. See also Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 255, n. 1.

शर्यणावन्त्

 occurs in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 84, 14; viii. 6, 39; 7, 29; 64, 11; ix. 65, 22; 113, 1; x. 35, 2. See Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 64 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 17); S4a1t2ya1yanaka in Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 84, 13. in all of which Sa1yan2a sees a local name. According to his account, S4aryan2a1h2 (masc. plur.) is a district in Kuruks2etra, S4aryan2a1vant being a lake not far from it in the back part (jaghana1rdhe) of Kuruks2etra. The unusual consistency of his statements on this point is in favour of the word being a place name; it is also to be noted that Kuruks2etra contained the lake Anyatah2plaks2a1. Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, thought that in two passages 3) i. 84, 14; x. 35, 2. the word denoted merely a ‘lake,’ literally ‘(water) covered with a thicket of reeds’ (s4aryan2a), and in the others a Soma vessel. Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 19, 20. inclines to this rendering. On the other hand, Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 217. So Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 398, 399. accepts Sa1yan2a's view. Hillebrandt 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 126, et seq. also sees in the word a place name, but he is inclined to locate it among the ‘five tribes,’ 7) This is deduced, not with any certainty, from Rv. ix. 65, 22. which is not quite inconsistent with its being in Kuruks2etra, for the connexion of the Pu1rus with the later Kurus is known; 8) Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 142, n. 4, Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 205. or perhaps, he suggests, S4aryan2a1vant is an old name for the Wular sea of Kas4mi1r, which was only a reminiscence in Vedic times. This is not probable; still less so is Ludwig's hypothesis 9) Op. cit., 3, 201. that the S4aryan2a1vant is the later eastern Sarasvati1. Bergaigne 10) Religion Ve4dique, 1, 206. regards the name as that of a celestial preparer of Soma.

शर्यात

 is mentioned once in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 17. as a prote4ge4 of the As4vins. Of him in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a^2 and the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a 3) iii. 120-122 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxlv). is told a story how Cyavana was annoyed by the S4a1rya1tas, and appeased by the gift of Sukanya1, S4arya1ta's daughter, as a wife, and how Cyavana was then restored to youth by the As4vins. He is there called Ma1nava (‘descendant of Manu’). He appears also as S4arya1ta Ma1nava, a sacrificer, in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 4) iv. 7, 1; 8, 3, 5. Cf.

Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 2) xii. 10 (Indische Studien, 3, 464). and Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. 3) i. 5, 10, 1 (where this is the interpretation of the commentator). Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 501. objects that the sense in all 5) He does not notice the Ka1t2haka. Against his criticism it must be noted that in every one of the passages a numeral is compounded with S4ala, as tri-s4ala, etc. these passages is not suited by this meaning.

शलभ
शलभ,
 ‘locust,’ appears in the Paippala1da recension of the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 5, 9. for S4arabha, the reading of the received text, and is regarded by Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 534. But the mention of the goat in the passage strongly supports Sarabha. See S4atapatha Bra1hman2a i. 2, 3, 9. as making better sense.

शलली

 is the name of the ‘silk cotton tree’ (Salmalia Malabarica). Its fruit is regarded as poisonous in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 50, 3. but the car of the bridal procession is made of its wood. 2) x. 85, 20. It is described as the tallest of trees. 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 12, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 13; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 7, 4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 4, 11, etc. Cf.

Roth 3) In Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 149. considers that a bird of prey is intended, while Whitney, 4) Loc. cit. Cf.

Cf. Ka1rika1 in Na1ra1yan2a on S4a1n3kha1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 1, 10; A1narti1ya on S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 2, 18. seem to recognize as teacher Suyajn5a S4a1n3kha1yana. In later times 4) Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xxxi. the school flourished in Northern Gujarat. S4a1n3kha1yana appears in the Taittiri1ya Pra1tis4a1khya 5) xv. 7. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 32, 44, 50 et seq.; 80, 313, 314; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 45, 191, 205, 245, 249. along with Ka1n2d2ama1yana.

शाट्यायन,
 ‘descendant of S4a1t2ya,’ is the patronymic of a teacher mentioned twice in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) viii. 1, 4, 9; x. 4, 5, 2. and often in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 2) i. 6, 2; 30, 1; ii. 2, 8; 4, 3; 9, 10; iii. 13, 6; 28, 5. In a Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the latter work 3) iv. 16, 1. he is called a pupil of Jva1la1yana, while in the Vam2s4a at the end of the Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a he appears as a pupil of Ba1dara1yan2a. The S4a1t2ya1yanins, his followers, are frequently mentioned in the Su1tras, 4) La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 5, 18; Anupada Su1tra, i. 8; ii. 9; iii. 2, 11; iv. 8, etc.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44. the S4a1t2ya1yani Bra1hman2a 5) A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, v. 23, 3. and the S4a1t2ya1yanaka 6) Ibid., x. 12, 13. 14; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 2, 24; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 4, 13. being also referred to in them. It has been shown by Oertel 7) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxli; 18, 20 et seq. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 203; Aufrecht, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 151, 152. that this Bra1hman2a bore a close resemblance to, and probably belonged to the same period as, the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a. 

शाण्ड
शाण्ड,
 ‘descendant of S4an2d2a,’ is the name of a man in the Rigveda 1) vi. 63, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158. who is praised for his generosity. It is not likely that he is identical with Purupantha1 mentioned in the next verse.

शाण्डिल
शाण्डिल,
 masc. plur., is the term applied to the ‘descendants of S4a1n2d2ilya’ in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka (i. 22, 10).

शाण्डिलीपुत्र
शाण्डिली-पुत्र,
 ‘pupil of a female descendant of S4an2d2ila,’ is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Ra1thi1tari1putra, in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) vi. 4, 32 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 5, 2 Ka1n2va).

शाण्डिल्य
शाण्डिल्य,
 ‘descendant of S4an2d2ila,’ is the patronymic of several teachers (see Udara and Suyajn5a). The most important S4a1n2d2ilya is the one cited several times as an authority in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) ix. 4, 4, 17; 5, 2, 15; x. 1, 4, 10; 4, 1, 11; 6, 3, 5; 5, 9. Cf. Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 11, 4. where his Agni, or ‘sacrificial fire,’ is called S4a1n2d2ila. 2) ix. 1, 1, 43; 3, 3, 18; 5, 1, 61, 68, etc. From this it appears clearly that he was one of the great teachers of the fire ritual which occupies the fifth and following books of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. In the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) at the end of the tenth book 3) x. 6, 5, 9. he is given as a pupil of Kus4ri and a teacher of Va1tsya; another list at the end of the last book in the Ka1n2va recension 4) vi. 5, 4. gives him as a pupil of Va1tsya, and the latter as a pupil of Kus4ri. In the confused and worthless 5) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxiv. n. 2. lists of teachers at the end of the second and fourth books of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad he is said to be the pupil of various persons--Kais4orya Ka1pya, 6) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Ma1dhyam2dina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Ka1n2va). Vais2t2apureya, 7) ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26 Ma1dhyam2dina. Kaus4ika, 8) ii. 6, 1; iv. 6, 1 Ka1n2va. Gautama, 9) ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26 (Ma1dhyam2dina = ii. 6, 1; iv. 6, 1 Ka1n2va). Baijava1pa, 10) ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26 Ma1dhyam2dina. and A1n2a bhimla1ta. 11) ii. 6, 2 Ka1n2va. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxi et seq.; 43, xviii et seq.; Weber, Indian Literature, 71, 76 et seq.; 120, 131, 132; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 213. No doubt different S4a1n2d2ilyas may be meant, but the lists are too confused to claim serious consideration.

शाण्डिल्यायन
शाण्डिल्यायन,
 ‘descendant of S4a1n2d2ilya,’ is the patronymic of a teacher in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) ix. 5, 1, 64. Apparently he is identical with Celaka, also mentioned in that text; 2) x. 4, 5, 3. The name S4a1n2d2ilya1yana, like that of Sa1n2d2ilya, is common in the Su1tras. See Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 45, et seq. it is thus reasonable to suppose that Cailaki Ji1vala 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 1, 34. was his son. It is much more doubtful whether he was 4) Weber, op. cit., 1, 259. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 53, 76, 120. the grandfather of Prava1han2a Jaivala, who was a prince rather than a Brahmin.

शातपर्णेय

 ‘descendant of S4ataparn2a,’ is the patronymic of Dhi1ra in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (x. 3, 3, 1).

 in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 5; x. 28, 4. and later 2) Av. iii. 24, 3; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 11. denotes the ‘drift’ brought down by streams, possibly conceived as the ‘curse’ of the waters. 3) Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 178; Vedische Studien, 3, 184, 185.

शामुल्य

Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 116, 233; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 4, 7; Kaus4ika Su1tra, lxix. 3. seems to have much the same sense as S4a1mulya, ‘a woollen shirt,’ generally. Roth 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxliii. emends to s4ami1la, ‘pieces of S4ami1 wood.’

शाम्ब
शाम्ब
 See S4a1rkara1ks2a.

शाम्बर
शाम्बर,
 properly an adjective in the sense of ‘relating to S4ambara,’ appears in one passage of the Rigveda (iii. 47, 4) to be used as a substantive denoting ‘the contest with S4ambara.’

शाम्बु
शाम्बु
 occurs in the plural with the An3girases in a passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) xix. 39, 5, where Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 960, retracts the emendation Bhr2gubhyah2 for S4a1mbubhyah2 in the text. no doubt as the name of a family of ancient teachers. There is extant in manuscript a Gr2hya Su1tra of the S4a1mbavyas. 2) Oldenberg, Indische Studien, 15, 4, 154. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 678.

1. S4a1ri occurs in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 12, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 33. It seems clear, since it is described as ‘of human speech’ (purus2a-va1c), that it was some kind of bird, possibly the later Sa1rika1 (‘starling’), as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 90, 91. suggests. See also S4a1ris4a1ka1. 

शारि
2. S4a1ri, occurring in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 16. is said by Sa1yan2a to mean ‘arrow.’ This is uncertain, but connexion with S4ara or 1. S4a1ri is quite possible. 2) Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 103.

शारिशाका
शारिशाका
 is an utterly obscure expression found in one passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) iii. 14, 5. Weber 2) Indische Studien, 17, 246. thinks it means ‘dung (s4akan) of the S4a1ri bird’; Grill 3) Hundert Lieder,^2 112. sees in the word the s4a1rika1, ‘the hooded crow’; Roth 4) In Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 110. suggests the emendation (s4a1rih2 (= s4a1lih2) s4aka iva, ‘like rice in manure’; and Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 351. But see Lanman's note in Whitney, loc. cit. emends s4a1ri-s4ukeva, ‘like starlings and parrots.’

शार्कराक्ष
शार्कराक्ष
 is found in the Vam2s4a Bra1hman2a 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. as the patronymic of a teacher, S4a1mba, perhaps by a blunder for S4a1rkara1ks2ya, ‘descendant of S4arkara1ks2a.’ In the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 2) xxii. 8. a teacher, S4arkara1khya, occurs, again probably a blunder, in this case for S4arkara1ks2a himself. The patronymic S4a1rkara1ks2i is found in the A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra. 3) xii. 10. 10.

शार्कराक्ष्य
शार्कराक्ष्य,
 ‘descendant of S4arkara1ks2a,’ is the patronymic of Jana in the S4atapatha Bra1hmana 1) x. 6, 1, 1. and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 2) v. 11, 1; 15, 1. In the plural they occur in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 3) ii. 1, 4. and the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 4) Indische Studien, 4, 382. Cf. Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 204; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 388; 3, 259. It is not necessary to assume that the form is incorrect for S4a1rkara1ks2a.

शार्ग
शार्ग
 is the name of a bird in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 19, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 33. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. Sa1yana on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 calls it the ‘wild Cat2aka.’

 --The Anukraman2i1 1) See also Sa1yan2a on Rv. x. 142; S2ad2gurus4is2ya on the Sarva1nukraman2i1 (ed. Macdonell), p. 163. (Index) of the Rigveda ascribes a hymn of that text 2) x. 142. to the S4a1rn3gas, Jaritr2, Dron2a, Sa1risr2kva, and Stambamitra. The Maha1bha1rata 3) i. 8334 et seq. contains a tale describing how the four S4a1rn3gas, sons of the R2s2i Mandapa1la, were saved from the great fire in the Kha1n2d2ava forest by means of prayers. Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 44-50. has attempted to use this tale for the elucidation of the hymn in question, but without substantial success. As Oldenberg 5) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 39, 79. says, the tale is based on the hymn rather than vice versa.

शार्यात
शार्यात,
 perhaps ‘descendant of S4arya1ta,’ is the name of a singer in the Rigveda. 1) i. 51, 12; iii. 51, 7. A S4a1rya1ta appears also in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 2) iv. 32, 7. with the patronymic Ma1nava as the seer of a Rigvedic hymn, 3) x. 92. and as having been anointed by Cyavana. 4) viii. 21, 4. The same man is evidently meant by S4arya1ta in the story of Cyavana in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 5) iv. 1, 5, 1 et seq. and the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a. 6) iii. 121 et seq. (Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society) 11, cxlv.; Hopkins, ibid., 26, 58. In both these passages the S4a1rya1tas are mentioned as his descendants, and his daughter is called S4a1rya1ti1.

See Gr2ha. The householder is called S4a1la1-pati, ‘lord of the house,’ in the Atharvaveda. 4) ix. 3, 12.

शालावत्य
शालावत्य,
 ‘descendant of S4ala1vant,’ is the patronymic of S4ilaka in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (i. 8, 1), and of Galu1nasa A1rks2a1ka1yan2a in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (i. 38, 4).

It is either the ‘crocodile,’ the ‘alligator,’ 3) Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 325, and Sa1yan2a on Rv., loc. cit.; Av., loc. cit.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, loc. cit. or the ‘porpoise’ 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. s4is4uma1ra; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 157; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 624.

 in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 3, 6, where Whitney suggests that it may be an ornamental hanging appendage. See Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 526. Whitney's alternative rendering ‘slings’ is better. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 597. Cf. perhaps Av. xiii. 4, 8. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 4, 2. 3; 6, 9, 1, etc. seems to mean a carrying ‘sling’ of rope. 3) This is pretty clearly the meaning in S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 28; vi. 7, 1, 16. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 268, n. 3.

So s4ikhan2d2in means ‘wearing a tuft of hair,’ and is found in Av. iv. 37, 7; xi. 2, 12, etc. 

शिखण्डिन्याज्ञसेन

शिग्रु
शिग्रु
 is the name of a tribe occurring in the passage of the Rigveda, 1) vii. 18, 19. in which they are mentioned with the Ajas and the Yaks2us as having been defeated by the Tr2tsus and King Suda1s. It is impossible to say whether they were or were not under the leadership of Bheda, as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. plausibly suggests. If Sigru is connected with the later s4igru, ‘horse-radish’ (Moringa pterygosperma), which is quite probable, it is possible that the tribe was totemistic and non-A1ryan, but this is a mere matter of conjecture. 3) Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 85; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 153; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, cliv; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 929 et seq.; Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 200, n. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 127. The Matsyas (‘Fishes’) were probably A1ryan.

शिञ्जार
शिञ्जार
 is the name of a R2s2i twice mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 5, 25; x. 40, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 3, 139. along with Kan2va, Priyamedha, Upastuta, and Atri. Geldner 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 179. takes the word either as a name of Atri or an adjective.

 (‘white-backed’) is the name of the Maitra1varun2a priest at the snake festival in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

 is a word of somewhat uncertain sense: it seems to mean ‘cheeks’ in several passages; 1) Rv. iii. 32, 1; v. 36, 2; viii. 76, 10; x. 96, 9; 105, 5, all according to Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Geldner. Rigveda, Glossar, 179, who treats the word as a neuter (s4ipra), takes it in i. 101, 10, as ‘lip’ (cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249, n.), and sees in iii. 32, 1; viii. 76, 10; x. 96, 9, the sense of ‘moustache.’ Ya1ska, Nirukta, vi. 17, gives the alternative senses of ‘jaw’ and ‘nose.’ in others 2) Rv. v. 54, 11; viii. 7, 25. Geldner, loc. cit., here accepts s4ipra1 as ‘helmet.’ it appears to designate the ‘cheek-pieces’ of a helmet, or of the ‘bit’ 3) Rv. i. 101, 10; Zimmer, loc. cit. of a horse. In ayah2-s4ipra, used of the As4vins, 4) Rv. iv. 37, 4. and the other compounds, hiran2ya-s4ipra, 5) Rv. ii. 34, 3. hari-s4ipra, 6) Rv. x. 96, 4. and hiri-s4ipra, 7) Rv. ii. 2, 3; vi. 25, 9. the word probably has the extended sense of ‘helmet,’ described as ‘of iron,’ ‘of gold,’ or ‘yellow,’ Similarly s4iprin 8) Rv. i. 29, 2; 81, 4; vi, 44, 14, etc. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 301; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 39, n. 2. would mean ‘wearing a helmet.’

शिफा
शिफा
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 104, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 18; Perry, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, 201. where Sa1yan2a explains the word as the name of a river, quite a possible interpretation.

शिबि
शिबि,
 son of Us4i1nara, is mentioned in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra 1) xxi. 18. Cf. Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 28. as a prote4ge4 of Indra, who sacrificed for him on the Vars2is2t2hi1ya plain, and saved him from fear of foreign invasion.

शिमिद
शिमिद,
 occurring in the Rigveda 1) vii. 50, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 394. in the compound a-s4inida, perhaps denotes a disease. The feminine form, S4imida1, is found as the name of a demoness in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 25, 4. and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 3) vii. 4, 1, 27. Cf. S4ipada.

शिम्बल
शिम्बल
 in the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 22. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 179; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 254. denotes, according to Sa1yan2a, the flower of the S4a1lmali (= S4almali), ‘silk-cotton tree.’ 

शिम्यु
शिम्यु
 occurs in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 5. as the name of one of the peoples or kings who were defeated by Suda1s in the Da1s4ara1jn5a (‘battle of the ten kings’). Since in another passage 2) i. 100, 18, where Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., thinks that the word simply means ‘enemy.’ the S4imyus are coupled with the Dasyus, Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 118, 119. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261. plausibly concludes that they were non-A1ryans.

शिरिम्बिठ
शिरिम्बिठ
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 155, 1. where the name of a man may possibly be meant, the Anukraman2i1 (Index) ascribing the hymn in which the word occurs to his authorship. Ya1ska, 2) Nirukta, vi. 30. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 167. however, renders the term by ‘cloud.’

2. S4ilpa Kas4yapa is named in the last Vam2s4a (list of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 1) vi. 4, 33 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 5, 3 Ka1n2va). as a teacher, a pupil of Kas4yapa Naidhruvi.

शिव
शिव
 as the name of a people occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 18, 7. where they share with the Alinas, Pakthas, Bhala1nases, and Vis2a1n2ins the honour of being defeated by Suda1s, not of being, as Roth 2) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Veda, 95 et seq.; once accepted by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. thought, his allies. There can hardly be any doubt of their identity with the  3) Arrian, Indica, v. 12. or  4) Diodorus, xvii. 96. of the Greeks, who dwelt between the Indus and the Akesines (Asikni1) in Alexander's time. The village of S4iva-pura, mentioned by the scholiast on Pa1n2ini 5) iv. 2, 109. Connected with S4iva by Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 376. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 431; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260 et seq. as situated in the northern country, may also perserve the name.

शिशुक
शिशुक
 in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 14, 3. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 291. seems to be an adjective meaning ‘young,’ but according to Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 464. it has the sense of ‘foal.’ The commentator, Sa1yan2a, reads S4us4uka, which he explains as a ‘wild animal so called.’ Cf. A1s4um2ga.

1. S4is4uma1ra. See S4im2s4uma1ra.

शिशुमार
2. S4is4uma1ra is a term applied to S4arkara in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiv. 5, 15), where he is called a S4is4uma1rars2i, explained by the commentator to mean a R2s2i in the form of a Sis4uma1ra.

शीपाल
शीपाल
 is the name of a water plant (Blyxa Octandra) mentioned in the Rigveda. 1) x. 68, 5. Cf. the derivative adjective s4i1palya, ‘overgrown with S4i1pa1la plants,’ S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iii. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71. Its later name is S4aivala.

शीर्षक्ति
 is a common word for ‘headache’ in the Atharvaveda. 1) i. 12, 3; ix. 8, 1; xii. 2, 19; 5, 23. Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xxxv; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 252; American Journal of Philology, 17, 416, who sees in it s4i1rs2asakti (cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 64, 2). Bo7htlingk, Proceedings of the Saxon Academy, 1897, 50, thinks the word means ‘a stiff neck, with head awry.’ See Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 14. In Av. xix. 39, 10, s4i1rs2a-s4oka is used for ‘headache.’

शीष्ट
शीष्ट
 occurs only in a Va1lakhilya hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 53, 4. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. where the word seems to be the name of an unimportant clan. 

शुक
शुक,
 ‘parrot,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) i. 50, 12. where a desire is expressed to transfer to the S4uka and the Ropan2a1ka1 the yellowness of jaundice. The bird is included in the list of sacrificial victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 12, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 33; and cf. s4ukababhru, ‘reddish, like a parrot,’ ibid., xxiv. 2. It is described as yellow and as ‘of human speech’ (purus2a-va1c). 3) Taittiri1ya and Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1s, loc. cit. According to Bloomfield, 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 352. this word is the correct reading for the second half of the obscure S4a1ris4a1ka1 of the Atharvaveda. 5) iii. 14, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90.

 (‘descendant of Gopa1la’) is the name of the priest of Vr2ddhadyumna Abhiprata1rin2a in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) iii. 48, 9 (Ganpala1yana in Aufrecht's edition). He is also mentioned in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1. 2) iii. 10, 4.

शुतुद्री

 twice mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 33, 1; x. 75, 5; Nirukta, ix. 26. is the name of the most easterly river of the Panjab, the modern Sutlej, the Zaradros of Ptolemy and Arrian. 2) In Arrian's time the Sutlej flowed independently into the Rann of Cutch: Imperial Gazetteer of India, 23, 179. In the post-Vedic period the name of this river appears transformed to S4atadru (‘flowing in a hundred channels’). The Sutlej has changed its course very considerably within historical times. 3) Ibid. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 10, 11.

शुनःपुच्छ
शुनः-पुच्छ,
 ‘Dog’s tail,’ is the name of a brother of S4unah2s4epa 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 15, 7; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, v. 20, 1.

शुनःशेप
शुनः-शेप,
 ‘Dog’s tail,’ is the name of a man with the patronymic A1ji1garti. According to a tale told in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vii. 13-18. and the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 2) xv. 20, 1 et seq. Cf. xvi. 11, 2. he was purchased as a victim by Rohita, King Haris4candra's son, who had been promised by his father to Varun2a as a sacrifice. He was actually bound to the stake, but was released in time through his supplications, supposed to be preserved in certain hymns of the Rigveda. 3) i. 24 et seq. Cf. v. 2, 7. He was adopted by Vis4va1mitra, to whose advice he owed the inspiration to ask the gods to release him, and became his son as Devara1ta, much to the annoyance of some of Vis4va1mitra's sons, who in consequence were cursed by their father. The Rigveda, however, contains merely the statement of S4unah2s4epa's deliverance from peril of death by the divine help, and the Yajurvedas 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 1, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xix. 11. The story is not found in Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 1. simply say that he was seized by Varun2a (perhaps with dropsy), 5) Cf. Varuna gr2hi1ta. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 408 et seq.; 573 et seq.; Roth, Indische Studien, 1, 457; ii. 112 et seq.; Weber, Indian Literature, 47, 48; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 10-16; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 355 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 207; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 146; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1911, 988, 989. but saved himself from Varun2a's bonds.

 in the dual, occurs in the Rigveda 1) iv. 57, 5. 8. and later 2) Av. iii. 17 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 7, 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xii. 69, etc. as the names of two agricultural deities, the personifications, probably, of ‘the share and the plough,’ as Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. For the native explanations, see Br2haddevata1, v. 8 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 116, 117, renders s4unam adverbially as ‘successfully.’ thinks.

शुनोलाङ्गूल

 ‘Dog’s tail,’ is the name of a brother of S4unah2-s4epa. 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 15, 7; Sa1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, xv. 20, 1. 

सुम्बल
सुम्बल
 is found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) xii. 5, 2. 3. The meaning of the word is uncertain: Harisva1mi in his commentary takes it to be ‘straw’; Eggeling 2) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 202, n. 3; comparing Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxv. 7, 12. suggests that dried cotton fibre or pods may be meant. In any case, some substance that easily catches fire is intended. 3) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

शुल्क
शुल्क
 in the Rigveda 1) vii. 82, 6; viii. 1. 5. clearly means ‘price.’ In the Dharma Su1tras 2) See Foy, Die Ro7nigliche Gewalt, 39 et seq. it denotes a ‘tax,’ a sense which is found by Muir 3) Sanskrit Texts, 5, 310. in a passage of the Atharvaveda, 4) iii. 29, 3. where s4ukla is read in the edition with great detriment to the sense. This correction is accepted by Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvida, 434. and by Whitney. 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 136. In another passage the same change made by Weber 7) Indische Studien, 17, 304. is not accepted by Whitney, 8) Op, cit. 253. and doubtfully by Bloomfield. 9) Loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 413.

सुश्मिण
सुश्मिण
 is a name of Amitratapana, a king of the S4ibis, in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 23, 10). 

शूद्र
शूद्र
 is the designation of the fourth caste in the Vedic state (see Varn2a). It is quite unknown in the Rigveda except in the Purus2asu1kta 1) x. 90, 12. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 8 et seq. (‘hymn of man’) in the tenth Man2d2la, where is the earliest version of the origin of the castes the S4udra for the first time appears. The Rigveda, on the other hand, knows Dasyu and Da1sa, both as aborigines independent of A1ryan control and as subjugated slaves: it is reasonable to reckon the S4u1dra of the later texts as belonging to the aborigines who had been reduced to subjection by the A1ryans. Strictly speaking, the defeated aborigines must have been regarded as slaves, but it is obvious that, except on occasions when most of the men were slain, which may have occurred quite often, there must have remained too many of them to be used as slaves of individual owners. The villages of the aborigines must have continued to subsist, but under A1ryan lordship and control: there may be this amount of truth in Baden Powell's theory, which practically traced all the early cultivating villages in India to Dravidian origin. On the other hand, the term S4u1dra would also cover the wild hill tribes which lived by hunting and fishing, and many of which would acknowledge the superiority of their A1ryan neighbours: it could, in fact, be applied to all beyond the pale of the A1ryan state. This view of the S4u1dra suits adequately the Vedic references to his condition, which would not apply adequately to domestic slaves only. The S4u1dra is continually opposed to the A1ryan, 2) Av. iv. 20, 4; xix. 32, 8; 62, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiv. 30; xxiii. 30. 31; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 10, 2; vii. 4, 19, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, As4vamedha, iv. 7; xvii. 5; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 8, 6; iii. 13, 1, etc. See also A1rya and Arya. In Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 3, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 17; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxviii. 5, Su1dra is opposed to Arya. and the colour of the S4u1dra is compared with that of the A1ryan, 3) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 17. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 4, 4, 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 4, 25; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 4, 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 6, 7; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 4; Muir, op. cit., 1^2, 140; Maha1bha1rata, xii. 188, 5. just as his ways are so contrasted. 4) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 17, 3. 4; S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 24. The Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 5) vii. 29, 4; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 439. in its account of the castes, declares that the S4u1dra is anyasya pres2ya, ‘the servant of another’; ka1mottha1pya, ‘to be expelled at will’; and yatha1ka1mavadhya, ‘to be slain at will.’ All these terms well enough describe the position of the serf as the result of a conquest: the epithets might have been applied to the English serf after the Norman Conquest with but slight inaccuracy, especially if his master had received a grant of jurisdiction from the Crown. The Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 6) vi. 1. 11. explains that even if prosperous (bahu-pas4u, ‘having many cows’) a S4u1dra could not be other than a servant: his business was pa1da1vanejya, ‘the washing of the feet’ of his superiors. The Maha1bha1rata 7) xii. 30, 7 (Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 73). The same text, xii. 294, 21 (ibid., 74, n.). insists on his duty of service. says out and out that a S4u1dra has no property (na hi svam asti s4u1drasya, ‘the S4u1dra has nothing he can call his own’). On the other hand, just as in England the royal justice would protect the serf in life and limb, 8) Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, 1, 350, 355, etc. so it appears that the slaying of a S4u1dra involved a wergeld of ten cows according to both Baudha1yana 9) Dharma Su1tra, i. 10, 19, 1. and A1pastamba. 10) Dharma Su1tra, i. 9, 24, 3. It may, indeed, be held that this wergeld was only due in case of murder by another than the master, but such limitation is nowhere stated. In sacred matters the distinction between A1ryan and S4u1dra was, of course, specially marked. The texts 11) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 4, 2; iv. 2, 2, 14, etc. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xvi. et seq.; 26, 292. Cf. Hopkins, op, cit., 13, 73, 75, n. do not hesitate to declare that the upper castes were ‘all,’ ignoring the S4u1dras; the S4u1dra is prohibited 12) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxi. 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 1, 3. So the stha1li1, ‘cooking vessel,’ is to be prepared by an A1ryan, Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 8, 3. from milking the cow for the milk required at the Agnihotra (‘oblation to Agni’); and the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 13) iii. 1, 1. 10. Cf. v. 3, 2, 2. forbids a man who has been consecrated (di1ks2ita) for a sacrifice to speak to a S4u1dra at all for the time, though the S4a1t2ya1yanaka 14) Quoted by A1pastamba, cited in the scholiast on Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, vii. 5, 7. The sense is not quite certain, but that given in the text seems reasonable. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 10, 11. seems to have relaxed this rule by confining it to cases in which the S4u1dra was guilty of some sin. At the sacrifice itself the S4u1dra could not be present in the s4a1la1, ‘hall’; he is definitely classed in the S4atapatha Bra1hma4n2a 15) iii. 1, 1, 10. See also Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 1, 6; Le4vi La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 82. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 16) vi. 1, 11. as unfit for ‘sacrifice’ (ayajn5iya); and declared in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 17) xi. 10, where he therefore does not receive Kari1ras. not to be admitted to drink Soma. At the Pravargya (introductory Soma) rite the performer is not allowed to come in contact with a S4u1dra, 18) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 1, 34. who here, as in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 17) xi. 10, where he therefore does not receive Kari1ras. is reckoned as excluded from a share in the Soma-draught. On the other hand, the S4u1dra is one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 19) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 1, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 6, 2, 10. He is also present at the Ra1jasu1ya, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 1. and a fight between an A1ryan and a S4u1dra, in which, of course, the former wins, forms a part of the Maha1vrata rite, being perhaps a precursor of the Indian drama. 20) Keith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 64, 534. Other indications, however, exist, showing that it would be undesirable to ignore the real importance of the S4u1dra, which again reminds us of the condition of the serf, who, though legally restrained, still gradually won his way to the rank of a free man. Rich S4u1dras are mentioned in the early texts, 21) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 7, 10; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 11. Some of the kings' ministers were S4u1dras; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 2, 2, with Sa1yan2a's note. just as S4u1dra gahapatis, ‘householders,’ occur in the Buddhist texts, and S4u1dra kings in the legal literature. 22) Foy, Die ko7nigliche Gewalt, 8; Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 83, 84. See Manu, iv. 61; Vis2n2u, lxxi. 64; perhaps Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 5. But see Roth's emendation, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxliii. Sin against S4u1dra and A1ryan is mentioned; 23) Ka1t2haka Sam2hit2a1, xxxviii. 5; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 3, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 17. prayers for glory on behalf of S4u1dras, as well as of the other castes 24) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 7, 6, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xl. 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 8; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 48, On the other hand, the S4u1dra uses magic just as an A1rya does, Av. x. 1, 3. occur; and the desire to be dear to S4u1dra as well as to A1ryan is expressed. 25) Av. xix. 32, 8; 62, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxvi. 2, etc. The Su1tras also, while they emphasize as general rules points earlier not insisted on, such as their inferiority in sitting, etc., 26) Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xii. 7; A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, ii. 10, 27, 15, So he can be insulted with impunity, Gautama, xii. 13, and is punished for insult by mutilation, ibid., xii. 1; A1pastamba, ii. 10, 27, 14. their exclusion from the study of the Vedas, 27) Gautama, xii. 4-6. the danger of contact with them 28) A1pastamba, i. 5, 17, 1; ii. 2, 3, 4, etc. or their food, 29) A1pastamba, i. 5, 16, 2, etc. still recognize that S4u1dras can be merchants, 30) Gautama, x. 60. Cf. x. 50-67 for an exhaustive account of the S4u1dra's duties in theory. His relations to his master are those of mutual support. or even exercise any trade. 31) Vis2n2u, ii. 14. Moreover, the Su1tras 32) Pa1raskara Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 4, 11. Rules to the contrary (e.g., Gobhila Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 2, 52) are for special occasions. See Weber, op. cit., 10, 74. On the other hand, criminal intercourse of a S4u1dra and an A1ryan woman is severely punished in the Su1tras. See A1pastamba, i. 10, 26, 20; 27, 9; Gautama, xii. 2. 3. permit the marriage of a S4u1dra1 woman with members of all castes. Though it was a reproach to Vatsa 33) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 6, 6. and to Kavas2a 34) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 19, 1. that they were the sons of a S4u1dra1 and a Da1si1 respectively, still the possibility of such a reproach shows that marriages of this kind did take place. Moreover, illicit unions of A1rya and S4u1dra1, or S4u1dra and A1rya1, are referred to in the Sam2hita1s of the Yajurveda. 35) A1rya and S4u1dra1: Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 30; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 19, 3; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 13, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, As4vamedha, iv. 8; S4u1dra and A1rya1: Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 31. This verse the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a no doubt deliberately ignores. The origin of the term S4u1dra is quite obscure, but Zimmer 36) Altindisches Leben, 216, 435. points out that Ptolemy 37) vi. 20. mentions  as a people, and he thinks that the Bra1hui may be meant. Without laying any stress on this identification, 38) The Bra1hui are now held not to be Dravidian ethnologically, but TurcoIranian (Indian Empire, 1, 292, 310). It is suggested (ibid., 1, 382) that they represent the original Dravidian type, which in India has been merged in the Mun2d2a1 type; but this suggestion is invalidated by the fact that the Rigveda speaks of the Dasyus as ana1s, ‘noseless’ (cf. Dasyu, 1, 347, n. 7). a term admirably applicable to Dravidians, but ludicrous as applied to the TurcoIranian type. It is much more plausible to assume that the Bra1huis are a mixed race, which in course of time has lost most of its Dravidian features. On the relation of Dravidians and speakers of Mun2d2a1 tongues, the Vedic texts throw no light. it is reasonable to accept the view 39) See Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 85, 255; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda. 3, 212; Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 201, 202.

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 241, 275. renders it as ‘canary seed.’

श्याव
1. S4ya1va is the name of a prote4ge4 of the As4vins in the Rigveda. 1) i. 117, 24; x. 65, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 150; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 32. He may be identical with Hiran2yahasta.

श्याव
2. S4ya1va is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 19, 37. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161. as a generous donor on the Suva1stu river.

श्याव
3. S4ya1va in one passage of the Rigveda (v. 61, 9) seems clearly, as Sa1yan2a thinks, to denote S4ya1va1s4va.

श्यावक
श्यावक
 is mentioned as a sacrificer and friend of Indra in the Rigveda (viii. 3, 12; 4, 2). He may be identical with 2. S4ya1va.

श्यावसायन
श्यावसायन
 is the patronymic of Devataras in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 40, 2). The form is perhaps an error for S4a1vasa1yana. 

श्यावाश्व
श्यावाश्व
 is the name of a man mentioned several times in the Rigveda. 1) v. 52, 1; 61, 5. 9 (Sya1va, a short form of the name, is here used); 81, 5; viii. 35, 19; 36, 7; 37, 7; 38, 8. The Anukraman2i1 (Index) assigns to him a series of hymns in the fifth, eight, and ninth books. 2) v. 52-61; 81; 82; viii. 35-38; ix. 32. In one of the hymns 3) v. 61. S4ya1va1s4va mentions, apparently as his patrons, Taranta (a son of Vidadas4va) and Purumi1lha, as well as Rathavi1ti. On this hymn is based a legend found in the Br2haddevata1, 4) v. 49 et seq. See also S2ad2gurus4is2ya on Anukraman2i1 to Rv. v. 61 (ed. Macdonell, p. 117 et seq.); Sa1yan2a on Rv. v. 61, 17-19; Ni1timan5jari1 in Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 50 et seq. that he was the son of Arcana1nas, who was sacrificing for Rathavi1ti Da1lbhya. The father was anxious to obtain the king's daughter for his son in marriage; but though the father was willing, his wife insisted on her son-in-law being a R2s2i. The father and son, repulsed, were returning home, when they met on the way Taranta and Purumi1d2ha, former patrons of the father. These showed him respect, while Taranta's wife, S4as4i1yasi1, presented S4ya1va1s4va with much wealth. The son was then fortunate enough to meet the Maruts in the forest, and praised them, thus becoming a seer. As a result the king himself ultimately offered his daughter to S4ya1va1s4va. Sieg 5) Op. cit.; 50-60. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 148. seeks to show that this legend is presupposed in the Rigveda; but it is difficult to accept this view, since the references in the Rigveda are very obscure, and S4as4i1yasi1 is probably no more than an epithet. 6) v. 61, 6. The word is taken as an epithet by Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and by Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27. That there is some Itiha1sa at the back of the hymn is clear: what it is can hardly now be determined. S4ya1va1s4va's obtaining gifts from Vaidadas4vi is referred to also in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra. 7) xvi. 11, 7-9. His name occurs in the Atharvaveda 8) iv. 29. 4; xviii. 3, 15. in two lists of persons, of which the former includes Purumi1d2ha, the latter also Arcana1nas and Atri. A Sa1man is ascribed to him in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 9) viii. 5. 9. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27, n. 4, bases on this an improbable conjeciure that he was a Ks2atriya. and he is perhaps referred to in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 10) i. 11, 2. But cf. Sieg, op. cit., 61, n. 4, who takes the word adjectivally, as in Av. xi. 2, 18, S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xix. 33, 26. In the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 11) viii. 5, 9. he is styled A1rcana1nasa, ‘son of Arcana1nas,’ and later 12) The Anukraman2i1 calls him and his father A1treya. In the passages from book viii. of the Rv., cited in n. 1, Atri is mentioned with him. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126, 127; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 214; R2gveda-Noten, 1, 354; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 359 et seq.; Le4vi, Ea Doctrine du Sacrifice, 122. he is called A1treya, ‘descendant of Atri.’

श्येन
श्येन
 is the name in the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 14; 33, 2; 118, 11; 163, 1; 165, 2, etc. of a strong bird of prey, most probably the ‘eagle’; later 2) Av. iii. 3, 4; vii. 41, 2; xi. 9, 9, etc. (as in post-Vedic Sanskrit) it seems to mean the ‘falcon’ or ‘hawk.’ It is the swiftest of birds, 3) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 7, 1; v. 4, 11, 1; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iii. 8. and a source of terror to smaller birds. 4) Rv. ii. 42, 2; Av. v. 21, 6. It is the strongest of birds, 5) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 14. and even attacks herds. 6) Rv. iv. 38, 5. This corresponds well enough with the eagle's known habit of carrying off young lambs. It watches over men (nr2-caks2as), 7) Av. vii. 41, 2. a reference, no doubt, to its lofty flight in air. It brings the Soma from heaven. 8) See Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 1-24, who cites all relevant passages. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 87, 88, who points out that the epithet r2jipya, ‘flying upwards,’ applied to the eagle, appears as an actual name of the eagle in Iranian.

श्रपयितृ
श्रपयितृ,
 ‘cook,’ is a term mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (i, 2, 2, 14).

श्रमण
श्रमण
 ‘mendicant monk,’ is first found in the Upanis2ads. 1) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 22; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, ii. 7, in IndischeStudien, 1, 78. According to Fick, 2) Die sociale Gliederung, 39 et seq. anyone could become a S4raman2a. For the time of Megasthenes this seems indicated by his evidence, which, however, refers only to the east of India, beyond the Madhyades4a proper. 3) Strabo, xv. 1, 49, 60; Arrian Indica, xii. 8, 9. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 27, 28, 129, 138. The Vedic evidence is merely the name and the fact that Ta1pasa, ‘ascetic,’ follows it in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad and the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka. 

श्रवण

श्रायस
श्रायस
 is the patronymic of Kan2va in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) v. 4, 7, 5. and the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 2) xxi. 8. where he appears as a teacher, and of Vi1tahavya in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 3) v. 6, 5, 3. and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 4) ix. 1, 9; xxv. 16, 3.

श्री
श्री
 is the regular word for ‘prosperity,’ found once in the Rigveda 1) viii. 2, 19, seems to have this sense. and often later. 2) Av. vi. 54, 1; 73, 1; ix. 5, 31; x. 6, 26; xi. 1, 12. 21; xii. 1, 63; 5, 7; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 8, 6; v. 1, 8, 6; vi. 1, 10, 3; vii. 2, 7, 3, etc. Already in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xi. 4, 3) she is regarded as a goddess. See Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 217 et seq. She already appears in the earliest Buddhist sculptures seated on a lotus between two elephants that pour water over her. This type of the goddess has survived down to the present day in India. S4res2t2hin.

श्रुतकक्ष
श्रुत-कक्ष
 is mentioned once in the Rigveda 1) viii. 92, 25. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108. as the R2s2i of a hymn, the authorship of which the Anukraman2i1 (Index) ascribes to him. A Sa1man or chant of his is mentioned in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a. 2) ix. 2, 7 (s4rauta-kaks2a).

श्रुतरथ
श्रुत-रथ
 is the name of a young king in the Rigveda. 1) i. 122, 7. He is also the patron of the Pajra family, including Kaks2i1vant. 2) Rv. v. 36, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 97. 

श्रुतर्य
श्रुतर्य
 occurs once in the Rigveda (i. 112, 9) as the name of a prote4ge4 of the As4vins.

श्रुतर्वनार्क्ष
श्रुतर्वन् आर्क्ष
 (‘descendant of R2ks2a’) is the name of a prince whose liberality is celebrated in one hymn of the Rigveda (viii. 74, 4. 13), and whose victory over Mr2gaya is mentioned in another (x. 49, 5).

श्रुतर्विद्
श्रुतर्-विद्
 is the name of a man in the Rigveda. 1) v. 44, 12. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138, 139.

श्रुतसेन
श्रुत-सेन
 is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xiii. 5, 4, 3) and the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xvi. 9, 4) as one of the brothers of Janamejaya.

श्रुषवाह्नेय
श्रुष वाह्नेय
 (‘descendant of Vahni’) Ka1s4yapa (‘descendant of Kas4yapa’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Devataras, in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 40, 1). It is much more likely that S4rus2a is a mere misreading for S4u1s2a.

श्रुष्टिगु
श्रुष्टि-गु
 (‘possessing obedient oxen’) is the name of a man in a Va1lakhilya hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 51, 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 140, 141; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90.

श्रेणि
श्रेणि
 means a ‘row’ or ‘line’ of birds, 1) Rv. v. 59, 7. or horses, 2) Rv. i. 126, 4. or chariots, 3) Rv. iv. 38, 6; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 14, 1. and so forth.

श्रेष्ठिन्
श्रेष्ठिन्
 occurs in several passages of the Bra1hman2as, 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 30, 3; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxviii. 6; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 20. Bhaga is the S4res2t2hin of the gods, Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 1, 4, 10. where the St. Petersburg Dictionary assigns to the word the sense of ‘a man of consequence.’ It is, however, possible that the word may already have the sense of the ‘headman of a guild,’ the modern Seth. 2) Cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 168 et seq. There is a similar doubt in the use of s4rais2t2hya, 3) Av. i. 9, 3 = Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 5, 4, 2 = Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, v. 6 = Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 4, 3. See also for the word, Av. x. 6, 31; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 25, 8; vii. 18, 8; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 9, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 7, 1, 1; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 2, 6; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, ii. 6; iv. 15, 20, etc. The use of s4rais2t2hya is, on the whole, not in favour of the theory that it is a technical term. which is perhaps not merely ‘the foremost place,’ as usually assumed, but definitely ‘the presidency of a guild.’ Guilds are referred to in the Dharma Su1tras, 4) Gautama Dharma Su1tra, xi. 20, 21, etc.; Foy, Die ko7nigliche Gewalt, 14, n. 2, etc. and they play a considerable part in the Buddhist texts 5) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 88 et seq. and the Epic. 6) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 81 et seq. But the Vedic evidence is inadequate to afford ground for positive assertion or denial of their existence or organization in Vedic times.

श्रोत्रिय
श्रोत्रिय
 in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 6, 37; x. 2, 20 et seq. and later 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiii. 4; xxviii. 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 25, 15; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 5; xiii. 4, 3. 14; Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, ii. 8, etc. Cf. maha1-s4rotriya, ‘a great theologian,’ in Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 11, 1. denotes a ‘Brahmin learned in holy lore,’ ‘theologian.’

श्रौतऋषि
श्रौत-ऋषि
 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 1, 6. or S4rautars2i, 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 4, 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 9, 11. ‘descendant of Srutar2s2i or S4rutars2i,’ is the patronymic of Devabha1ga.

श्रौमत्य
श्रौमत्य,
 ‘descendant of S4rumant,’ is the name of a teacher in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (x. 4, 5, 1).

श्लेष्मन्
श्लेष्मन्
 means generally that with which parts of a thing are joined together (from s4lis2, ‘join’): with reference to a hide, 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 32, 6; Jaimini1ya Upanisad Bra1hman2a, iii. 17, 3; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 17, 4. ‘laces’ of some sort may be intended; to a chariot, 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 9. Cf. Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 1, 13, where a chariot (Ratha) is called s4les2mavant, ‘tied with ropes.’ ‘bonds’ or ‘cords’ are probably meant; and to wood, 3) Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, vi. 12. Cf. the Upanis2ads, cited in n. 1, and Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, ii. 1, which looks like a bad secondary version of the passage in the Jaimini1ya. ‘glue’ is perhaps the sense.

श्लोक
श्लोक,
 in the plural, is found enumerated after the Upanis2ads, and before the Su1tras, in the list of literary types given in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6 (Ma1dhyam2dina = iv. 1, 2 Ka1n2va); 5, 11. In the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad 2) iii. 10, 6. the S4loka-kr2t appears: he is rather the ‘poet,’ as Max Mu7ller 3) Sacred Books of the East, 15, 69 renders it, than merely one who ‘calls aloud,’ as the St. Petersburg Dictionary explains the term. 4) In Av. v. 20, 7, the word has the sense assigned to it by the Dictionary. Exactly what is meant cannot be said: ‘verses’ generally may be intended, several kinds being preserved in the Bra1hman2as and called S4lokas. 5) E.g., Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 1, 5; 5, 4, 12; xiii. 7, 1, 15; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 22, 3: Aitareya A1ran2yaka, ii. 3, 8; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 18, 4; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, viii. 1; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, i. 6, etc.

श्लोण्य
श्लोण्य
 in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a 1) iii. 9, 17, 2. Cf. s4lon2a, ‘lame,’ Av. xii. 4, 3; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 6, 7, etc. denotes ‘lameness,’ not ‘skin disease’ (tvag-dos2a), as explained by the commentator.

श्वघ्निन्
श्व-घ्निन्
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 92, 10; ii. 12, 4; iv. 20, 3; viii. 45, 38. and the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 16, 5. clearly means a ‘gamester’ or ‘professional gambler.’ It may originally have denoted a ‘hunter.’ 3) Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 71.

श्वन्
श्वन्
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 13 (where the sense is quite obscure); 182, 4; ii. 39, 4, etc. and the Atharvaveda 2) Av. vi. 37, 3; xi. 2, 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, viii. 8, 22, etc. is the word for ‘dog,’ the feminine being S4uni1. 3) Av. iv. 20, 7 (catur-aks2i1); S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 5, 2, 10. The dog was a tame animal, 4) Rv. ii. 39, 4. and used to guard the house from thieves or other intruders. 5) Rv. vii. 55, 5. He was also employed in hunting the boar (vara1ha-yu), 6) Rv. x. 86, 4. but was no match for the lion. 7) Av. iv. 36, 6. A hundred dogs are mentioned as a gift in a Da1nastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in a Va1lakhilya hymn. 8) Rv. viii. 55, 3. Elsewhere the dog is regarded as unfit for sacrifice, as being unclean, 9) Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 51, 4; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 4, 1, 4. and is driven away from the sacrifice. 10) Rv. ix. 101, 1. To eat dog's flesh was a last resort of despair and hunger. 11) Rv. iv. 18, 3. Later, s4va-paca (‘dog-cooking’) denotes a degraded caste. The bones of the feast were given to the dog. 12) Av. vi. 37, 3. Cf. ix. 4, 16. Sarama1 figures in legend as Indra's faithful dog 13) i. 62, 3; 72, 8, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 151. searching for the cows. Rudra is lord of dogs (s4va-pati) in the Yajurveda; 14) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 28; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 5. the ‘dog-keeper’ (s4vanin) is mentioned in the list of sacrificial victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the same Sam2hita1. 15) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 27; xxx. 7; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 3, 1, etc. Cf. s4va-ni1 (‘dog-leader’), Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 5. The four-eyed (catur-aks2a) dogs of certain texts 16) Cf. Rv. x. 14, 10. 11; Av. xviii. 2, 11. 12: Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, vi. 3, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 8, 4, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 1, 2, 9, etc. are, of course, mythological. 17) Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 165 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 500, thinks that Yama's two dogs are the sun and the moon (cf. Divya S4van). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 233: Hopkins, American Journal of Philology, 15, 154-163. Cf. Kurkura.

स्वपद्
स्व-पद्
 denotes a ‘savage animal,’ ‘beast of prey,’ in the Atharvaveda (viii. 5, 11; xix. 39, 4).

श्वयथ
श्वयथ
 in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) iv. 2, 1, 11 (of the eye, in a myth). means ‘swelling.’ Possibly s4i1yathu, the disease prevalent in Videha according to the Baudha1yana S4rauta Sutra, 2) ii. 5: Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 35, 36. was a kind of ‘swelling’ (? goitre). 

श्ववर्त
श्व-वर्त,
 ‘found in dogs,’ is, according to some manuscripts, the name of a species of worm in the Atharvaveda (ix. 4, 16). See S4avarta.

श्वशुर
श्वशुर
 from the Rigveda onwards 1) x. 28, 1; 85, 46; 95, 4; Av. viii. 6, 24; xiv. 2, 26, etc. denotes the ‘father-inlaw’ of the wife; not till the Su1tra period does it include the ‘father-in-law’ of the husband. 2) Pa1raskara Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 10, 46. The daughter-in-law (Snus2a1), in the normal case when the father-in-law was the head of the family to which her husband belonged in fact as well as in age, was bound to pay him all respect. 3) See Rv. x. 95, 4; Av. viii. 6, 24; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 12 (Indische Studien, 5, 260); Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 22, 7. So in Av. xiv. 2, 26, the daughter-in-law is to be ‘helpful’ to the father-in-law. When the old man had ceased to exercise control, she became mistress (samra1jn5i1) over him and his wife. 4) Rv. x. 85, 46. See Pati. In the plural 5) Rv. x. 95, 12; Av. xiv. 2, 27; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, loc. cit. Or it may be a plural majestatis, but not a sign of polyandry. Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 515, 516. the word denotes the ‘parents-in-law.’

श्वश्रू
श्वश्रू
 denotes ‘mother-in-law’ of the husband 1) Rv. x. 85, 46; Av. xiv. 2, 26. as well as of the wife. 2) Rv. x. 34, 3. She, together with her husband, if he became unable to manage the family, 3) Rv. x. 85, 46. fell under the daughter-in-law's sway, but otherwise was entitled to regard. 4) Av. xiv. 2, 26. The gambler in the Rigveda 5) Rv. x. 34, 3. Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Vermandtschaftsnamen, 516. complains of his having lost the favour of his wife's mother as one of the misfortunes brought upon him by dicing.

श्वाजनि

 like S4vapad, denotes a ‘savage animal’ or ‘beast of prey.’ It is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) x. 16, 6. in the Atharvaveda, 2) xi. 10, 8. and occasionally later. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 10 (where the tiger, S4a1rdu1la, is mentioned as the chief of them); xii. 2, 4, 16; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 4, 29; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xii. 16, etc.

श्वाविध्
श्वा-विध्
 (‘dog-piercing’) is the name of the ‘porcupine’ in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 13, 9. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 20, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 56; xxiv. 33, etc. It is called ‘long-eared’ (karn2a). 3) Av., loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82. See also S4alyaka.

श्विक्न
श्विक्न
 is the name of a people twice mentioned in the Satapatha Bra1hman2a 1) xii. 8, 3, 7; xiii. 5, 4, 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 209, 210. in connexion with their king, R2s2abha Ya1jn5atura. Cf. S4vaikna.

S4vitra (‘white’) is the name of a species of serpent in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 27, 6 (where there is a variant citra); x. 4, 5, 13. and the later Sam2hita1s. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 10, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 13, 21, has in the parallel passage citra, probably by error. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 134. Perhaps S4vitra, in the lis of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 39, has this sense; but the St. Petersburg Dictionary explains it as ‘a certain domestic animal,’ or, generally ‘a white animal.’

श्वित्र
2. S4vitra is found as an adjective in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xii. 11, 11) in the sense of ‘afflicted with white leprosy.’

 Arun2eya 1) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 2, 7, 12; 5, 4, 18; 6, 2, 1; xii. 2, 1, 9; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 7, 1; vi. 1, 1 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 2, 1 Ka1n2va); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 3, 1; vi. 1, 1; 8, 1. (‘descendant of Arun2a’) or Audda1laki 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 3, 13; iv. 2, 5, 14. (‘son of Udda1laka’) is mentioned repeatedly in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. In the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad 3) i. 1. he appears as S4vetaketu, son of A1run2i, and as a Gautama. In the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 4) xxvi. 4. he is quoted as an authority on the vexed question of the duty of the Sadasya, or the seventeenth priest, at the ritual of the Kaus2i1takins, to notify errors in the sacrifice; A1run2i, his father, is also cited. He was a person of some originality, for he insisted on eating honey despite the general prohibition of the use of that delicacy by Brahmaca1rins or religious students. 5) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 5, 4, 18. He was a contemporary of, and was instructed by the Pan5ca1la king Prava1han2a Jaivala. 6) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 1 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 2, 1 Ka1n2va); Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 3, 1. He was also a contemporary of Janaka, of Videha, and figured among the Brahmin disputants at his court. 7) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 6, 2, 1 (it is to be noted that he came upon Janaka when travelling about with some other Brahmins: he was never settled in the Videha country, but was clearly a Kuru-Pan5ca1la, like his father); Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 7, 1, where he shares the usual fate of defeat in argument by Ya1jn5avalkya. A story is told of him in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra: 8) xvi. 27, 6 et seq. The exact sense of kr2tsnake brahmabandhau vyajijn5a1sis2i is not quite certain. But A1run2i seems to assert the love of knowledge, not of material advantages accruing to the Purohita, to have been his concern in life. Jala Ja1tu1karn2ya was lucky enough to become the Purohita of three peoples or kings, of Ka1s4i, Kosala, and Videha. Seeing this, S4vetaketu felt annoyed and reproached his father with his excessive devotion to sacrifice, which merely enriched and glorified others, not himself. His father replied, forbidding him to speak thus: he had learned the true method of sacrificing, and his ambition in life had been to discuss it with every Brahmin. All the references to S4vetaketu belong to the latest period of Vedic literature. It is, therefore, not surprising that the A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra 9) i. 2, 5, 4-6. should refer to him as an Avara, or person of later days, who still became a R2s2i by special merit. His date, however, must not be fixed too low, because the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a in which he plays so marked a part is certainly earlier than Pa1n2ini, and was apparently even in that grammarian's time believed to be an ancient work: hence 500 B.C. is probably rather too late than too early a period for S4vetaketu as a rough approximation to a date. 10) See on this, Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xxxvii et seq.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxv et seq.; Max Mu7ller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 360 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 65; 13, 443; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 22 et seq.

श्वैक्न
श्वैक्न,
 ‘king of the S4viknas,’ is the title of Prati1dars4a, who was, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) ii. 4, 4, 3. one of those who offered the Da1ks2a1yan2a sacrifice. He also taught Suplan Sa1rn5jaya the sacrifice: hence Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 209, 210. has inferred a connexion of the S4viknas and the Sr2n5jayas.

श्वैत्रेय
श्वैत्रेय
 occurs in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 33, 14; v. 19, 3. where Sa1yan2a sees in the word the name of a man, a ‘descendant of S4vitra1.’ The first passage is almost identical with one in the sixth Man2d2ala of the Rigveda, 2) vi. 26, 4. where, however, Das4adyu appears alone without S4vaitreya. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147. identifies Das4adyu with S4vaitreya (‘son of S4vitri1’), and considers him a son of Kutsa. 4) Cf. Rv. i. 51, 6; vi. 26, 3, 4. Bergaigne 5) Religion Ve4dique, 3, 11. and Baunack 6) Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 35, 527. think he is really Bhujyu. Geldner 7) Rigveda, Glossar, 7, 8. considers that he was a bull used for fighting, the son of a S4vitra1 cow, 8) Cf. s4vaitari1, Rv. iv. 33, 1. but this is very doubtful, though the term s4vaitreya is elsewhere applied to a bull. 9) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 935. S4vitrya 10) Rv. i. 33, 15, where Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., takes s4vitryam as the accusative of s4vitri1. seems to have the same sense as S4vaitreya. S2.

 and Sam2-likhita occur in the Atharvaveda (vii. 50, 5) as two technical terms, of unknown sense, used in dicing.

संवत्सर
सं-वत्सर,
 ‘year,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 110, 4; 140, 2; 161, 13; vii. 103, 1, 7, etc.; Av. i. 35, 4; ii. 6, 1; iii. 10, 2; iv. 35, 4; vi. 53, 3, etc. It duration was, according to the concurrent evidence of the Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as, 360 days, divided into 12 months, being, no doubt, roughly a lunar synodic year, which, however, it exceeded in length by 6 days. 2) See Ma1sa. As a solar year it appears only in the Nida1na Su1tra 3) v. 12, 2. 5. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 284. of the Sa1maveda, where the sun is stated to spend 13(1/3) days in each of the 27 Naks2atras. The year being obviously out of harmony with the solar year (whether sidereal or tropical), efforts were certainly made to effect an assimilation of the natural and the accepted year. As has been seen (see Ma1sa), the evidence goes strongly to show that the intercalation was not an easy matter in the Bra1hman2a period, though there are traces of what may be regarded as a five-yearly or six-yearly intercalation. But there is no conclusive evidence that these periods were really observed. Zimmer, 4) Altindisches Leben, 369, 370, and cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. sam2vatsara, 2. indeed, considers that the evidence required is afforded by the lists of the years, which are sometimes enumerated as five: Sam2vatsara, Parivatsara, Ida1vatsara, Idvatsara, and Vatsara; 5) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxvii. 45. or Sam2vatsara, Parivatsara, Ida1vatsara, Iduvatsara, Vatsara; 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 7, 3, 4. or Sam2vatsara, Ida1vatsara, Iduvatsara, Idvatsara, Vatsara; 7) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 10, 4, 1. or Sam2vatsara, Parivatsara, Ida1vatsara, Anuvatsara, Udvatsara; 8) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xiii. 15; xxxix. 6; xl. 6. or Sam2vatsara, Parivatsara, Ida1vatsara, Anuvatsara, Idvatsara. 9) Garga, quoted in the commentary on Jyotis2a, 10. But it must be noted not merely that the names vary considerably, but that four only are mentioned in some places, 10) Sam2-, Pari-, Ida1-, Anu-vatsara, Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 13, 17; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 10, 1. in others 11) Ida1-, Pari-, Sam2-vatsara, Av. vi. 55, 3; Idu-, Pari-, Sam2-vatsara, Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 7, 2, 4. three, in others 12) Sam2-, Pari-vatsara, Av. viii. 8, 23; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, x. 80. two, and in yet others 13) Sam2-, Pari-, Ida1-, Anu-, Vatsara, Sam2-vatsara, Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 15; Sam2-, Pari-, Ida1-, Idu-, Id-, Vatsara, Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iv. 19, 1. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 298, n. 1; Max Mu7ller, Rigveda, 4^3, xxv, n. 1. six. Moreover, in none of these enumerations is there any reference to the names being connected with a system of intercalation. It is most probable that here we have no more that a mere series of priestly variations of Vatsara, based on the older and more genuine Sam2vatsara and Parivatsara as variants of the simple Vatsara, ‘year.’ The key to the invention of the series is probably to be found in passages like that of the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 14) xvii. 13, 17. where the several Ca1turma1sya (‘four-monthly’) sacrifices are equated with the different years. 15) Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 91; Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 12; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 42. Particularly unjustifiable is the attempt of Zimmer to see in the two-year series a series of two years of 354 days each, with an intercalary month in the second; for the year of 354 days, as such, is not known to have existed before the Su1tra period. Zimmer 16) Op. cit., 366, 367; Tilak, Orion, 16 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 145. also finds an attempt at intercalation in the famous 12 days in which the R2bhus are said to have slept in the house of Agohya. 17) Rv. iv. 33, 7. Cf. i. 110, 2; 161, 13. See on this legend, Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 133; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 236. He thinks that they represent twelve days added at the winter solstice to equate the lunar year of 354 days and the solar year of 366 days; and from the reverence paid in German antiquity to the ‘12 nights,’ he infers that this mode of intercalation is Indo-Germanic. 18) See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 242 et seq.; 17, 223, 224; 18, 45, 46; Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1894, 809; Thibaut, op. cit., 10; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 308, 310; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xciv. There can be little doubt that this view is wrong, and that the 12 days are merely the ‘reflexion of the year’ (sam2vatsarasya pratima1) 19) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, vii. 15; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 9, 10; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxv. 15. See also Atharvaveda, iv. 11, 11; Weber, Omina und Portenta, 388. in the sense that they represent the twelve months, and have no relation to chronology at all. A reference to the use of Sam2vatsara alone as the fifth year of the cycle is seen by Shamasastry 20) Gava1m Ayana, 137, 138. in the peculiar dating of certain notices in the Baudha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 21) ii. 12; iii. 1; xxvi. 18; xxx. 3. See also Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, i. 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 1, 1, 7. but this view is improbable. 22) Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Bandha1yana, 36, 37, gives a much more reasonable explanation of the anomaly.

 in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 4, 10, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 21 et seq.; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 16; ix. 1, 1, 8 (cf. Gavedhuka1), etc.; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 2 (cf. Apa1ma1rga). Cf. Kuvala, Karkandhu, Badara: S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 22, etc. denotes ‘coarsely ground meal,’ ‘groats,’ especially ‘barley meal.’ In the Rigveda, 2) x. 71, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. where the word occurs only once, it seems rather to mean grain before it is winnowed by the Titau7. If the latter word, however, designates a ‘sieve,’ Saktu might still mean ‘groats,’ as opposed to fine meal.

सखि

संगव
सं-गव
 denotes the time when the grazing cows are driven together for milking. In the division of the day the word denotes the period before midday, ‘forenoon.’ It is found in the Rigveda 1) v. 76, 3. and often later. 2) Av. ix. 6, 46; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 9, 2; 5, 3, 1; ii. 1, 1, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 3, 9; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, ii. 9, 4; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 12, 4. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 112 et seq. Cf. Go and Ahan.

संगविनी

 is found in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) iii. 18, 14. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 112, 113; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 362. where it is said that the animals of the Bharatas in the evening were at the Gos2t2ha, ‘pasture,’ but at midday came to the Sam2gavini1, apparently a shed or an enclosure in which during the heat of the day they were milked.

संग्रहीतृ
सं-ग्रहीतृ
 is found in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 9, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8 (as a Ratnin) in the S4atarudriya in the plural Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 4, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 26. and the Bra1hman2as. 2) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 3, 5; 9, 6; iii. 8, 5, 3; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii, 25, 6. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 8; 4, 3, 23. He is an official who figures among the Ratnins of the king. The sense of ‘charioteer’ seems adequate for every passage, but Sa1yan2a 3) on Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 9, 2, and optionally on i. 8, 16; but as charioteer on i. 8, 15; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 10, 6. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 63, n. 1. in some passages inclines to think that the meaning is ‘treasurer’ of the king.

संग्राम
सं-ग्राम
 denotes primarily, it seems, ‘assembly’ either in peace 1) Av. xii. 1, 56, where it is joined with Samiti. We might see in this passage, and that cited in n. 2, the technical name of the village assembly as opposed to the larger assemblies of the people, but there is no good warrant for so doing. or in war, 2) Av. iv. 24, 7, where sam2gra1ma1n is read; but the parallel passages (Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 7, 15, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 16, 5) have sam2gra1mani. when it means an ‘armed band.’ Its normal sense in the Atharvaveda 3) v. 21, 7; xi. 9, 26. and later 4) Taittiri1ya Samhita1, ii. 1, 3, 1; 8, 4, etc. is ‘war,’ ‘battle.’ Little is known of Vedic warfare, but it seems to have been simple. A body of foot soldiers with charioteers composed every army, the two going together, 5) Rv. ii. 12, 8. and the foot soldiers being often overthrown by the charioteers, 6) Av. vii. 62, 1. Cf. Mus2t2ihan who were doubtless the Ks2atriyas and their foremost retainers. Probably the foot soldiers bore little armour, and used only the bow for offence, as is suggested by the account that Herodotus gives of the Indian contingent of the army with which Xerxes invaded Greece. 7) Herodotus, vii. 65. The nobles, on the other hand, may have had cuirass (Varman), helmet (S4ipra1), and hand-guard (Hastaghna) as a protection from the friction of the bowstring. On the car was the charioteer, and on his left the warrior (Sa1rathi, Savyas2t2ha1). Riding is never mentioned in war, 8) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296, where he admits riding to be mentioned elsewhere; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 3, 312. and would hardly have been suited to Vedic ideas, for the warrior mainly depended on his bow, which he could not have used effectively from horseback. The offensive weapon (A1yudha) was practically the bow; spear and sword and axe were very seldom used. Whether there was a strict tribal organization of the host, such as is once alluded to in the Homeric poems, 9) Ibid, ii. 362. and is also recognized in Germany by Tacitus, 10) Germania, 7. is uncertain (cf. Vra1ta), but in the Epic relations (Jn5a1ti) fight together, 11) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 193. and this rule, no doubt, applied more or less in Vedic times also. Cities were besieged and invested (upa-sad, pra-bhid), 12) Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 2, 3, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 4, 3-5; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, i. 23, 2, etc.; Gopatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 2, 7; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 300, n. probably as a rule by blockade, since the ineffective means of assault of the time would have rendered storming difficult and expensive. Hillebrandt 13) Op. cit. 3, 289, n. thinks that the pur caris2n2u1 of the Rigveda 14) viii. 1, 2-8, where it is attributed to the demon S4us2n2a. was a kind of chariot; it may--like the Trojan horse--have been an Indian anticipation of the Roman means of assaulting a town. Besides ordinary wars of defence and conquest, raids into neighbouring territory seem to have been frequent and normal, 15) Cf. Rv. x. 142, 4, as interpreted by Sa1yan2a and by Hillebrandt, op. cit., 2, 64, n. 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 4, 1 (of the model Kuru kings). no doubt because of the booty (Uda1ja, Nira1ja) which was to be won, and which the king had to share with the people. Banners (Dhvaja) were borne in war, and musical instruments (Dundubhi, Bakura) 16) So, later, Arrian, Indica, vii. 9. The shouts of either side are shown in the word krandas (Rv. ii. 12, 8; cf. vi. 25, 6; x. 121, 6), which came to mean the ‘shouting host.’ Cf. also Tacitus, Germania, 2. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 469472; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 564; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 293-301. See also Is2u, Dhanvan, Ratha. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 281 et seq., gives a full account of the later Epic armour and warfare. See also his note, ibid., 15, 265, 266. For sacrifice in battle, cf. Purohita. were used by the combatants.

संघात

 seems in a few passages 1) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxix. 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, i. 16; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 4, 18. to have the sense of ‘battle.’

सचिव
सचिव
 ‘companion,’ ‘attendant’ (from sac, ‘follow’), later a common word for the comrade of a king, his minister, is found in Vedic literature in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (iii. 20, 1), where it is used by Indra of the Maruts. It seems to correspond in sense to the German comes or the English gesith. 1) Stubbs, Select Charters, 57.

 (‘born together’) is found once in the Rigveda, 1) i. 109, 1. and very often later. 2) Av. i. 9, 3; 19, 3; ii. 6, 4; iii. 3, 6; vi. 5, 2; 73, 1; xi. 1, 6, 7; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 3, 2; 2, 1, 2; 6, 9, 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 12, 13; xii. 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, v. 23; x. 29; xxvii. 5, and often in the Bra1hman2as. The word must clearly mean a ‘relative,’ and then more widely a man of the same position or rank, but the senses cannot be distinguished, so much do they merge into each other. The Saja1tas of a king are of course princes; 3) Av. iii. 3, 4. 6; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 188. of an ordinary man, Vais4yas; 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 19 (the Saja1tas of a Gra1man2i1). of a military man, Ks2atriyas. But there is no clear reference to caste as in the later Saja1ti 5) Manu, ix. 87; x. 41, etc. The abstract saja1tya (‘kinship’) is found in Rv. ii. 1, 5; iii. 54, 16; viii. 18, 19; 20, 21; 27, 10; x. 64, 13; but even it has no definite caste reference. (‘man of the same caste’). The disputes of Saja1tas were notorious. 6) Cf. Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, 12, 2.

संचर
सं-चर
 in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 1) v. 4, 3, 5. has the sense of the ‘path’ of animals. Normally it is the term designating the ‘passage’ or ‘space’ on the sacrificial ground used or occupied by the several persons taking part in the rite. 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 9, 2, 4; iii. 1, 3, 28; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 7, 11; Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 3, 42, etc.

संज्ञान
सं-ज्ञान,
 ‘concord,’ ‘harmony,’ is mentioned from the Rigveda 1) x. 19, 6. onwards 2) Av. iii. 30, 4; vii. 52, 1; xi. 1, 26, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 3, 2; 3, 1, 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxvi. 1; xxx. 9; Nirukta, iv. 21, etc. as a matter of great consequence; the Atharvaveda contains many spells to bring it about. The lack of peace in the Vedic village was almost inevitable in view of its small size and the economic interdependence of its inhabitants. Cf. Bhra1tr2vya.

सत
सत
 is the name of a vessel of some kind mentioned in the ritual. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 27, 88; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 7, 2, 13; 8, 3, 14.

सतीनकङ्कत
सतीन-कङ्कत
 1) The literal meaning seems to be ‘having a real comb.’ is, in the Rigveda, 2) i. 191, 1. the name of some animal, according to Sa1yan2a an ‘aquatic snake.’ 3) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

He was initiated as a Brahmaca1rin, or religious student, by Gautama Ha1ridrumata according to the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad. 1) iv. 4, 1, et seq. He is often cited as an authority in that Upanis2ad 2) iv. 5, 1; 6, 2; 7, 2; 8, 2; 9, 10; 10, 1; v. 2, 3. and in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, 3) iv. 1, 14 (Ma1dhyam2dina = iv. 1, 6 Ka1n2va). where he learns a certain doctrine from Ja1naki A1yasthu1n2a. 4) vi. 3, 19 (= vi. 3, 12).

सत्ययज्ञ
सत्य-यज्ञ
 (‘true sacrificer’) Paulus2i (‘descendant of Pulus2a’) Pra1ci1nayogya (‘descendant of Pra1ci1nayoga’) is the name of a teacher in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) x. 6, 1, 1. the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, 2) v. 11, 1. and the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a. 3) iii. 40, 2 (in a Vam2s4a, ‘list of teachers’). In the latter text he is said to have been the pupil of Pulus2a Pra1ci1nayogya.

सत्यवचस्
सत्य-वचस्
 (‘true-speaking’) Ra1thi1tara (‘descendant of Rathi1tara’) is, in the Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad (i. 9, 1), the name of a teacher who insisted on the importance of truth.

सत्यश्रवस्
सत्य-श्रवस्
 (‘of true renown’) Va1yya (‘descendant of Vayya’) is the name of a R2s2i in the Rigveda. 1) v. 79, 1 et seq. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156. thinks that he was the son of Suni1tha S4aucadratha.

सत्यहविस्
सत्य-हविस्
 is the name of a mythical Adhvaryu, or sacrificial priest, in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 (i. 9, 1, 5).

सत्याधिवाकचैत्ररथि
सत्याधिवाक चैत्ररथि
 (‘descendant of Citraratha’) is the name of a man in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (i. 39, 1). 

सत्वन्
सत्वन्
 in the Rigveda, 1) i. 133, 6; 173, 5; ii. 25, 4; 30, 10; iii. 49, 2, etc. and occasionally later, 2) v. 20, 8; vi. 65, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 8. 20, etc. has the sense of ‘warrior.’

सत्वन्त्
सत्वन्त्
 is the name of a people who are stated in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) viii. 14, 3. to belong to the south. In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) xiii. 5, 4, 21. the defeat by Bharata of the Satvants, and his taking away the horse which they had prepared for an As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), are referred to: this reference clearly shows that in another passage of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 3) ii. 25, 6. the text must be altered from satvana1m to Satvata1m, ‘of the Satvants,’ against whom it seems the Bharatas made regular raids. The name has also been found by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, Cowell, and Max Mu7ller in the Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, 4) iv. 1. but it is certain 5) Oldenberg, Buddha, 393, n., correcting Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 1, lxxvii. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 211, 212, 419; 9, 254; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 367. that the reading there is not Satvan-Matsyes2u, but sa-Vas4a-Matsyes2u.

सदानीरा
सदा-नीरा,
 ‘having water always’ (‘perennial’), is the name of a stream which, according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) i. 4, 1, 14 et seq. was the boundary between the Kosalas and the Videhas. The river is identified by the native lexicographers with the Karatoya1, 2) See Imperial Gazetteer of India, 15, 24. but this seems to be too far east. Weber's 3) Indische Studien, 1, 172, 181. identification of it with the Gan2d2aki1 4) See s.v. Great Gandak, Imperial Gazetteer of India, 12, 125. is probably correct; for though the Maha1bha1rata 5) ii. 794. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 398, n. distinguishes the two rivers, there is nothing to show that this is due to any good tradition.

सदापृण

Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147. thinks that the Sanakas are referred to as non-sacrificers in one passage of the Rigveda, 3) i. 33, 4. but this is very doubtful. 4) Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 189.

 (‘famed of old’) Arim2dama (‘tamer of foes’) is mentioned as a Maha1ra1ja in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (vii. 34, 9).

सनाच्छव
सनाच्-छव
 is perhaps the proper name of a teacher in the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1. 1) xx. 1. The Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1 2) xxxi. 3 (von Schroeder, Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, 2, 18, n. 5). has S4ahana1s4chiva. Very probably the reading of both texts is bad. 

सनातन
सनातन
 is the name of a mythical R2s2i in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. In the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad 2) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Ma1dhyam2dina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Ka1n2va). he appears in the first two Vam2s4as (lists of teachers) as the pupil of Sanaga and the teacher of Sana1ru, both equally mythical persons. ^1 iv. 3, 3, 1.

संधा
सं-धा
 denotes in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as 1) Av. xi. 10, 9, 15; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 7, 8, 4; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 1, 6; ii. 1, 1, 3; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 1. an ‘agreement’ or ‘compact.’

संधि
सं-धि
 denotes the ‘juncture’ of heaven and earth, the ‘horizon,’ in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) iii. 2, 1, 5; x. 5, 4, 2. It also has the sense of ‘twilight’ 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 25; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 5, 1; ii. 2, 9, 8; dual; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 55; ix. 4, 4, 13, etc. The later term is Sam2dhya1. as the juncture of light and dark.

संनहन
सं-नहन
 in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 1, 2, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 3, 6; ii. 6, 1, 15, etc. denotes a ‘band’ or ‘rope.’ 

सपत्न
स-पत्न,
 ‘rival,’ is a common word in the later Sam2hita1s, 1) Av. i. 19, 4; x. 6, 30; xii. 2, 46; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 2, 2; iii. 2, 8, 5, etc. being also found in the tenth Man2d2ala of the Rigveda. 2) x. 166, 1, etc.; also in the compound sapatna-kan, ‘slaying rivals,’ x. 159, 5, etc.; Av. i. 29, 5, etc. It is a curious masculine formed by analogy from Sa-patni1, ‘co-wife,’ and so ‘female rival.’

सपत्नी
स-पत्नी
 occurs in the Rigveda in the sense of ‘co-wife’; 1) iii. 1, 10; 6, 4. in the first and the last Man2d2alas it means co-wife as a ‘rival.’ 2) i. 105, 8; x. 145, 1-5 (cf. in verse 2, patim me kevalam kuru, ‘make my husband exclusively mine’). In post-Vedic Sanskrit the word becomes a synonym for ‘rival.’

सप्तगु
सप्त-गु
 is the reputed author of a Rigvedic hymn in a verse of which he is mentioned. 1) x. 47, 6. Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 423.

सप्तसिन्धवः
सप्त सिन्धवः,
 ‘the seven rivers,’ occur only once in the Rigveda as the designation of a definite country, 1) viii. 24, 27. while elsewhere 2) Rv. i. 32, 12; 34, 8; 35, 8; 71, 7; 102, 2; iv. 28, 1; viii. 96, 1, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxviii. 26; Atharvaveda, iv. 6, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 6, 1, etc. the seven rivers themselves are meant. Max Mu7ller 3) Chips, 1, 63. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 490, n. thinks that the five streams of the Panjab, with the Indus and the Sarasvati1, are intended; others 4) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200; Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 3; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 3, 311. hold that the Kubha1 should be substituted for the Sarasvati1, or that perhaps the Oxus 5) Cf. Thomas, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1883, 371 et seq. must originally have been one of the seven. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 21. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278; India, Old and New, 33. is probably right in laying no stress at all on any identifications; ‘seven’ being one of the favourite numbers in the Rigveda and later. 

सप्तसूर्याः
सप्त सूर्याः,
 the ‘seven suns’ referred to in the Sam2hita1s, 1) Av. xiii. 3, 10; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 9. are named in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 2) i. 7. Cf. the ‘seven tongues’ of Agni which are mentioned in the Rigveda, and each of which later receives an individual name: Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 89. as A1roga, Bhra1ja, Pat2ara, Patan3ga, Svarn2ara, Jyotis2i1mant, and Vibha1sa, but these occur very rarely even later. 3) Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 266; Hopkins, Great Epic of India, 475. Weber at one time 4) Indische Studien, 1, 170; 2, 238. thought that the seven planets (see Graha) were meant by the phrase, but later he abandoned the idea. 5) Ibid., 10, 271, n., where he compares the sapta dis4o na1na1-su1rya1h2, ‘seven regions with various suns,’ of Rv. ix. 114, 3. Probably the ‘seven rays’ of the Rigveda 6) Rv. i. 105, 9; viii. 72, 16; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 277. are meant.

सप्तमानुष
सप्त-मानुष
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 39, 8. as an epithet of Agni, ‘belonging to the seven tribes.’ Hopkins 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278. thinks that this is a reference to the seven ‘family’ books of the Rigveda (ii.-viii.), but this seems less likely than the view of Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. that saptama1nus2a is equivalent to vais4va1nara.

सप्तवध्रि
सप्त-वध्रि
 is the name of a prote4ge4 of the As4vins, who appear from several passages of the Rigveda 1) v. 78, 5; viii. 73, 9; x. 39, 9. to have rescued him from a tree in which he had got fastened. He is mentioned in the Atharvaveda. 2) iv. 29, 4. According to Geldner, 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 190. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Baunack, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 50, 268. he is identical with Atri.

सप्ति
सप्ति
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 85, 1, 6; 162, 1; ii. 34, 7; iii. 22, 1, etc. and later 2) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 19, 22. denotes a ‘swift steed.’ 

सप्त्य
सप्त्य
 in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 41, 4) seems to denote a ‘racecourse.’

सबन्धु
स-बन्धु
 (‘of the same kin’) in the Rigveda 1) iii. 1, 10; v. 47, 5; viii. 20, 21, etc. and later 2) Av. vi. 15, 2; viii. 2, 26; xv. 8, 2. 3, etc. denotes ‘related.’

सभा
सभा
 is the name of an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic Indians as well as of the ‘hall’ where they met in assembly. It is often mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vi. 28, 6; viii. 4, 9; x. 34, 6. Cf. sabha1-saha, ‘eminent in the assembly,’ x. 71, 10. and later, 2) Av. v. 31, 6; vii. 12, 1, 2; viii. 10, 5; xii. 1, 56; xix. 55, 6; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 7, 6, 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 7, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 45; xvi. 24; xx. 17; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 10, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 3, 2, 3; v. 3, 1, 10; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, vii. 9, etc. but its exact character is not certain. The hall was clearly used for dicing, 3) Rv. x. 34, 6; Av. v. 31, 6; xii. 3, 46 (here dyu1ta is used in place of Sabha1). presurnably when the assembly was not transacting public business: a dicer is called sabha1-stha1n2u, ‘pillar of the assembly hall,’ doubtless because of his constant presence there. 4) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 18; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 16, 1, with Sa1yan2a's note. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 172, inclines to see in the formula (Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 45; xx. 17; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 3, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, ix. 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 10, 2) ‘what sin we have committed in the village, the jungle, the Sabha1’ a reference to attacks on the great (Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, iii. 45), or partiality in deciding disputes (Mahi1dhara, ibid., xx. 17). But it may refer to gambling or other nonpolitical activity, as Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 398, takes it, though he renders it differently, ibid., 44, 265. The hall also served, like the Homeric , as a meeting-place for social intercourse and general conversation about cows and so forth, 5) Rv. vi. 28, 6. Cf. viii. 4, 9. So in Av. vii. 12, 2, the assembly is hailed as naris2t2a1, ‘merriment.’ But the same hymn (vii. 12, 3) contains a clear reference to serious speech in the Sabha1. For the blending of serious political work and amusement, cf. Tacitus, Germania, 22. possibly for debates and verbal contests. 6) So Zimmer, op. cit., 174, takes sabheya in Rv. ii. 24, 13. According to Ludwig, 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 253256. He quotes for this view Rv. viii. 4, 9; x. 71, 10 (passages which are quite vague). Cf. also Rv. vii. 1, 4; Av. xix. 57, 2. the Sabha1 was an assembly not of all the people, but of the Brahmins and Maghavans (‘rich patrons’). This view can be supported by the expressions sabheya, ‘worthy of the assembly,’ applied to a Brahmin, 8) Rv. ii. 24, 13. Cf. i. 91, 20; Av. xx. 128, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 22, etc. Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 276, sees in sabheya the implication of ‘courtly manners,’ but this is rather doubtful; manner is not conspicuous in Vedic society as in Homeric. rayih2 sabha1va1n, ‘wealth fitting for the assembly,’ 9) Rv. iv. 2, 5; in i. 167, 3, sabha1vati1 is applied to ‘speech,’ or perhaps to yos2a1, ‘woman.’ and so on. But Bloomfield 10) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 13. plausibly sees in these passages a domestic use of Sabha1, which is recognized by the St. Petersburg Dictionary in several passages 11) Av. viii. 10, 5 (where the sense is, however, clearly ‘assembly’; see viii. 10, 6); Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 8, 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 1, 10, 3; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 14 (but here the sense is certainly ‘assembly hall,’; see v. 3, 6, where the king is described as going to the assembly hall: sabha1-ga) The exact sense given by the St. Petersburg Dictionary is the ‘society room’ in a dwelling-house. as relating to a house, not to the assembly at all. Zimmer 12) Altindisches Leben, 174. But he ignores S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 4, 14; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 3, 6, which show that the king went to the Sabha1 just as much as to the Samiti, and he cannot adduce any passage to show that the Gra1man2i1 presided. is satisfied that the Sabha1 was the meetingplace of the village council, presided over by the Gra1man2i1. But of this there is no trace whatever. Hillebrandt 13) Vedische Mythologie, 2, 123-125. seems right in maintaining that the Sabha1 and the Samiti cannot be distinguished, and that the reference to well-born (su-ja1ta) 14) Rv. vii. 1, 4. men being there in session is to the A1ryan as opposed to the Da1sa or S4u1dra, not to one class of A1ryan as opposed to the other. Hillebrandt also sees in Agni ‘of the hall’ (sabhya) a trace of the fire used in sacrifice on behalf of the assembly when it met. 15) Agni is sabhya, Av. viii. 10, 5; xix. 55, 6. For the Rv., see iii. 23, 4; v. 3, 11; vii. 7, 5. Women did not go to the Sabha1, 16) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 7, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 172174. for they were, of course, excluded from political activity. For the Sabha1 as a courthouse, cf. Gra1myava1din. There is not a single notice of the work done by the Sabha1.

सभाचर
सभा-चर
 is one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 2, 1 with Sa1yan2a's note. Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 77, n. 1. The St. Petersburg Dictionary thinks it is an adjective equivalent in sense to sabha1-ga,’ ‘going to the assembly.’ As he is dedicated to Dharma, ‘Justice,’ it is difficult not to see in him a member of the Sabha1 as a law court, perhaps as one of those who sit to decide cases: there is nothing to show whether the whole assembly did so, or only a chosen body. The special use of Sabha1cara suggests the latter alternative. See also Sabha1sad.

सभापति
सभा-पति,
 ‘lord of the assembly,’ is an epithet in the S4atarudriya. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 24; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 3, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 13, etc.

सभापाल
सभा-पाल
 is found in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (iii. 7, 4, 6), where the sense may be ‘guardian of an assembly hall.’

सभाविन्
सभाविन्
 in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (iii. 4, 16, 1) denotes, according to the commentator Sa1yan2a, the ‘keeper of a gambling hall.’

सभासद्
सभा-सद्,
 ‘sitter in the assembly,’ is probably a technical description of the assessors who decided legal cases in the assembly (cf. Sabha1cara). The term, which is found in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 29, 1 (of Yama); vii. 12, 2; xix. 55, 6. and later, 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, i. 6, 11; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 2, 1, 26; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 21, 14. cannot well merely denote any member of the assembly. It is also possible that the Sabha1sads, perhaps the heads of families, were expected to be present at the Sabha1 oftener than the ordinary man: the meetings of the assembly for justice may have been more frequent than for general discussion and decision.

 is a word of obscure sense occurring in two passages of the Atharvaveda. 1) i. 12, 2; vi. 50, 1. Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 7, 142. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders it ‘hook’ in the first, and takes it to mean an insect destructive of grain in the other.

समन
समन
 is a word of somewhat doubtful sense in the Rigveda. Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders it either ‘battle’ 2) Rv. vi. 75, 3. 5; ix. 96, 9; x. 143, 4; Av. vi. 92, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 9. or ‘festival.’ 3) Rv. ii. 16, 7; vi. 60, 2; vii. 2, 5; viii. 12, 9; ix. 97, 47; x. 55, 5; 86, 10; Av. ii. 36, 1. Pischel 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 314. thinks that it was a general popular festivity to which women went to enjoy themselves, 5) Rv. i. 124, 8 (cf. Vra1); iv. 58, 8; vi. 75, 4; vii. 2, 5; x. 86, 10; 168, 2. poets to win fame, 6) Rv. ii. 16, 7; ix. 97, 47. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 38. bowmen to gain prizes at archery, 7) Rv. vi. 75, 3. 5. horses to run races; 8) Rv. ix. 96, 9; Av. vi. 92, 2. and which lasted until morning 9) Rv. i. 48, 6, which Roth takes as referring to men going to business. or until a conflagration, caused by the fires kept burning all night, scattered the celebrators. 10) Rv. x. 69, 11. Cf. vii. 9, 4. Young women, 11) Av. ii. 36, 1. elderly women, 12) Rv. vii. 2, 5. sought there to find a husband, and courtezans to make profit of the occasion. 13) Rv. iv. 58, 8, where, as in vi. 75, 4; x. 168, 2, Roth sees the sense of ‘embrace.’ The parallel with the festivals of Greece, where only young girls were able freely to mix with strangers, and which afforded the basis of so many of the comedies of the later school, is striking (cf. Mahaffy, Greek Literature, 1, 2, 259 et seq.). Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 190.

 in the sense of ‘battle’ is found in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, 1) vii. 9; Sa1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xv. 15, 12. and, according to Geldner, 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 190. in the Rigveda. 3) vi. 9, 2 (at the sacrifice; cf. samarya, iv. 24, 8, etc.).

समा
समा
 appears originally to have denoted ‘summer,’ a sense which may be seen in a few passages of the Atharvaveda. 1) i. 35, 4; ii. 6, 1; iii. 10, 9. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 36. Hence it also denotes more generally ‘season,’ a rare use. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 25, 7; Nirukta, ix. 41. More commonly it is simply ‘year’; 3) Rv. iv. 57, 7; x. 85, 5; 124, 4; Av. v. 8, 8; vi. 75, 2, etc. but in one place the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 4) vi. 2, 1, 25. interprets it in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 5) xxvii. 1, with Mahi1dhara's note. See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 168, n. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 372; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 301. as meaning ‘month,’ a doubtful sense.

समिति
सम्-इति
 denotes an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic tribe. It is already mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) i. 95, 8; ix. 92, 6; x. 97, 6; 166, 4; 191, 3. and often later, 2) Av. v. 19, 15; vi. 88, 3; vii. 12, 1; xii. 1, 56, etc. sometimes in connexion with Sabha1. 3) Av. vii. 12, 1; xii. 1, 56; xv. 9, 2. 3; viii. 10, 5. 6. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 253 et seq. considers that the Samiti included all the people, primarily the vis4ah2, ‘subjects,’ but also the Maghavans and Brahmins if they desired, though the Sabha1 was their special assembly. This view is not probable, nor is that of Zimmer, 5) Altindisches Leben, 172 et seq. that the Sabha1 was the village assembly. Hillebrandt appears to be right in holding that Samiti and Sabha1 are much the same, the one being the assembly, the other primarily the place of assembly. 6) Vedische Mythologie, 2, 124, n. 6. The king went to the assembly 7) Rv. ix. 92, 6; x. 97, 6 (where the reference is hardly to an oligarchy, as Zimmer, 176, 177, holds, but merely to the princes of the blood going to the assembly with the rest). just as he went to the Sabha1. That he was elected there, as Zimmer 8) Op. cit., 175, quoting Av. vi. 87, 88, with Rv. x. 173, and Av. v. 19, 15, with Av. iii. 4, 6. thinks, is as uncertain as whether he was elected at all (see Ra1jan). But there are clear signs that concord between king and assembly were essential for his prosperity. 9) Av. vi. 88, 3. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2, takes Samiti here and in v. 19, 15; Rv. x. 166, 4; 191, 3, to mean ‘union,’ but this is neither necessary nor probable. It is reasonable to assume that the business of the assembly was general deliberation on policy of all kinds, legislation so far as the Vedic Indian cared to legislate, and judicial work (cf. Sabha1sad). But of all these occupations there is, perhaps as a result of the nature of the texts, little or no evidence directly available. The gods had a Samiti, hence called daivi1, ‘divine,’ 10) Rv. x. 11, 8. just as they had a Sabha1. 11) Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, ii. 11, 13, 14. The assembly disappears as an effective part of government in the Buddhist texts, 12) Cf. Bu7hler, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 55, on the Pari1sa. the Epic, 13) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 148-152, who traces the decay of the old assembly through the aristocratic war council and the secret priestly conclave. It is, of course, very probable that at no time was the Samiti a place where any or much attention was paid to the views of the common man. Princes and great men spoke; the rest approved or disapproved, as in Homeric times and in Germany (cf. Lang, Anthropology and the Classics, 51 et seq.; Tacitus, Germania, 11, 12, where their general duty of discussion and their criminal jurisdiction are mentioned). and the law-books. 14) Foy, Die ko7nigliche Gewalt, 6, 7, 10.

समुद्र

 (literally ‘gathering of waters’), ‘ocean,’ is a frequent word in the Rigveda and later. It is of importance in so far as it indicates that the Vedic Indians knew the sea. This is, indeed, denied by Vivien de Saint Martin, 1) E4tude sur la ge4ographie du Ve4da, 62 et seq. Cf. Wilson, Rigveda, 1, xii. but not only do Max Mu7ller 2) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 61 et seq., quoting Rv. i. 71, 7; 190, 7; v. 78, 8; vii. 49, 2; 95, 2; x. 58. and Lassen 3) Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 883. assert it, but even Zimmer, 4) Altindisches Leben, 22 et seq. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 143, 144. who is inclined to restrict their knowledge of the sea as far as possible, admits it in one passage of the Rigveda, 5) vii. 95, 2. and of course later. 6) Av. iv. 10, 4 (pearl shell); vi. 105, 3 (the outflow, vi-ks2ara, of the ocean); xix. 38, 2; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 13, 1, etc. He points out that the ebb and flow of the sea are unknown, that the mouths of the Indus are never mentioned, that fish is not a known diet in the Rigveda (cf. Matsya), and that in many places Samudra is metaphorically used, as of the two oceans, 7) Rv. x. 136, 5. Cf. Av. xi. 5, 6. the lower and the upper oceans, 8) Rv. vii. 6, 7; x. 98, 5. etc. In other passages he thinks that Samudra denotes the river Indus when it receives all its Panjab tributaries. 9) See, e.g., Rv. i. 71, 7; iii. 36, 7; 46, 4; v. 85, 6; vi. 36, 3; vii. 95, 2; viii. 16, 2; 44, 25; ix. 88, 6; 107, 9; 108, 16 (where reference is made to streams); or Rv. i. 163, 1; iv. 21, 3; v. 55, 5; viii. 6, 29, where land and Samudra are contrasted. It is probable that this is to circumscribe too narrowly the Vedic knowledge of the ocean, which was almost inevitable to people who knew the Indus. There are references to the treasures of the ocean, 10) Cf. Rv. i. 47, 6; vii. 6, 7; ix. 97, 44. perhaps pearls or the gains of trade, 11) Cf. Rv. i. 48, 3; 56, 2; iv. 55, 6; and the general parallelism of the Dioscuri and the As4vins. and the story of Bhujyu seems to allude to marine navigation. That there was any sea trade with Babylon in Vedic times cannot be proved: the stress Iaid 12) E.g., by Weber, Indian Literature, 3. on the occurrence in the Hebrew Book of Kings 13) 1. Kings x. 22. of qof and tukhii1m, ‘monkey’ (kapi) and ‘peacock,’ is invalidated by the doubtful date of the Book of Kings. There is, besides, little reason to assume an early date for the trade that no doubt developed later, perhaps about 700 B.C. 14) See Kennedy, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1898, 241-288; Bu7hler, Indische Studien, 3, 79 et seq.; Indisehe Palœographie, 17-19, who much exaggerates the antiquity of the traffic; Vincent Smith, Early History of India, 25, n. In the later texts Samudra repeatedly means the sea. 15) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 8, 2; vii. 5, 1, 2. It is described as unfailing in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 16, 7 (cf. iii. 39, 7); it encircles the earth, ibid., viii. 25, 1. The eastern and western oceans in S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 3, 11 (cf. x. 6, 4, 1), though metaphorical, probably indicate an acquaintance with both seas, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. Cf.

In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 3) v. 1, 1, 13. Cf. xii. 8, 3, 4; xiv. 1, 3, 8. in accordance with its curious theory of the Va1japeya and Ra1jasu1ya, the Samra1j is asserted to be a higher authority than a king, and to have become one by the sacrifice of the Va1japeya. There is, however, no trace of the use of the word as ‘emperor’ in the sense of an ‘overlord of kings,’ probably because political conditions furnished no example of such a status, as for instance was attained in the third century B.C. by As4oka. At the same time Samra1j denotes an important king like Janaka of Videha. 4) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 3, 2, 1. 6; 2, 2, 3; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 1, 1; 3, 1. Cf.

सरयु

 is mentioned thrice in the Rigveda as the name of river. Citraratha and Arn2a are said to have been defeated apparently by the Turvas4as and Yadus who crossed the Sarayu. 1) iv. 30, 18. This passage gives no help, because the possibility is open either to suppose that the Turvas4a, Yadu are not mentioned as defeating the A1ryans Citraratha and Arn2a; or, if they are, to suppose that they may have come east against the two. Sarayu appears in one passage with Sarasvati1 and Sindhu, 2) x. 64, 9. and in another with Rasa1, Anitabha1, and Kubha. 3) v. 53, 9. Later, in the post-Vedic period, Sarayu1, rarely Sarayu, is the name of a river in Oudh, the modern Sarju1. 4) This is a tributary joining the Gogra1, the great river of Oudh, on the left of its upper course. The name Sarju1 is also applied to the Gogra1 itself below Bahra1mgha1t. A branch of the Lower Gogra1, given off on the right, flowing in an old bed of the Gogra1, and falling into the Ganges after passing Ballia1, is called the Chhoti1 (Lesser) Sarju1. Cf. Imperial Gazetteer of India, 22, 109; 12, 302 (Gogra1); 23, 418 (Eastern Tons); 26, Plate 31. Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 17, 45. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, xxv; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 323. regards this as the river meant in all the Vedic passages, seeing in the last, 3) v. 53, 9. which may be used as an argument for locating the Sarayu in the Panjab, a reference to the north-east monsoon as well as to the usual monsoon from the west. Hopkins 6) Religions of India, 34. thinks that the Sarayu is to be found in the west, and Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 280. identifies it with the Kurum (Krumu). Vivien de St. Martin considered it to be probably identical with the united course of the S4utudri1 (Sutlej) and Vipa1s4 (Beas).

 1) Literally, ‘abounding in pools,’ perhaps with reference to its condition when the water was low. The name corresponds phonetically to the Iranian Haraqaiti (the modern Helmand). is the name of a river frequently mentioned in the Rigveda and later. In many passages 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 2, 1, 4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 10, 1; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xii. 2, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 1, 14; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 19, 1. 2; probably Av. vi. 30, 1. This list is according to Roth's view, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3c. of the later texts it is certain the river meant is the modern Sarasvati1, which loses itself in the sands of Patiala (see Vinas4ana). Even Roth 3) Rv. iii. 23, 4 (where the Dr2s2advati1 appears); x. 64, 9: 75, 5 (where the S4indhu also is mentioned). admits that this river is intended in some passages of the Rigveda. With the Dr2s2advati1 4) Probably the modern Chautang, which flows to the east of Thanesar. Cf. Oldham, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 25, 58; Imperial Gasetteer of India, 26, Plate 32. it formed the western boundary of Brahma1varta (see Madhyades4a). It is the holy stream of early Vedic India.

These passages should all be classed in n. 2. Roth held that another river, the Sindhu (Indus), was really meant: only thus could it be explained why the Sarasvati1 is called the ‘foremost of rivers’ (nadi1tama1), 8) Rv. ii. 41, 16. is said to go to the ocean, 9) Rv. vi. 61, 2. 8; vii. 96, 2. and is referred to as a large river, on the banks of which many kings, 10) Rv. viii. 21, 18. and, indeed, the five tribes, were located. 11) Rv. vi. 61, 12. This view is accepted by Zimmer 12) Altindisches Leben, 5-10. and others. 13) E.g., Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 60; 2, 90, etc.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 201, 202. On the other hand, Lassen 14) Indische Alterthumshunde, 1^2, 118. and Max Mu7ller 15) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 60. maintain the identity of the Vedic Sarasvati1 with the later Sarasvati1. 16) In the enumeration of rivers (evidently from east to west) in Rv. x. 75, 5, Gan3ga1, Yamuna1, Sarasvati1, S4utudri1, the Sarasvati1 comes between the Jumna and the Sutlej, the position of the modern Sarsu1ti (Saraswati1), which, flowing to the west of Thanesar, is joined in Patiala territory by a more westerly stream, the Ghaggar, and, passing Sirsa, is lost in the desert at Bhatnair; but a dry river bed (Hakra or Ghaggar) can be traced from that point to the Indus. See Imperial Gasetteer of India, 26, Plate 32. Cf. also Oldham, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 25, 49-76. The latter is of opinion that in Vedic times the Sarasvati1 was as large a stream as the Sutlej, and that it actually reached the sea either after union with the Indus or not, being the ‘iron citadel,’ as the last boundary on the west, a frontier of the Panjab against the rest of India. There is no conclusive evidence of there having been any great change in the size or course of the Sarasvati1, though it would be impossible to deny that the river may easily have diminished in size. But there are strong reasons to accept the identification of the later and the earlier Sarasvati1 throughout. The insistence on the divine character of the river is been in the very hymn 17) Rv. ii. 41, 16 (devitame). which refers to it as the support of the five tribes, and corresponds well with its later sacredness. Moreover, that hymn alludes to the Pa1ra1vatas, a people shown by the later evidence of the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 18) See Pa1ra1vata, and cf. Br2saya. to have been in the east, a very long way from their original home, if Sarasvati1 means the Indus. Again, the Pu1rus, who were settled on the Sarasvati1, 19) Rv. vii. 95, 96. Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 175, admits that the Indus cannot be meant here. See Hillebrandt. Vedische Mythologie, 1, 115. could with great difficulty be located in the far west. Moreover, the five tribes might easily be held to be on the Sarasvati1, when they were, as they seem to have been, the western neighbours of the Bharatas in Kuruks2etra, and the Sarasvati1 could easily be regarded as the boundary of the Panjab in that sense. Again, the ‘seven rivers’ in one passage 20) Rv. viii. 24, 27. The connexion of Sarasvati1 and the seven rivers is rather vague. In Rv. viii. 54, 4, Sarasvati1 and the seven rivers are separately invoked, and in vi. 61, 10, 12, she is referred to as ‘seven-sistered’ (saptasvasa1). In vii. 36, 6, she is called the ‘seventh,’ which makes the Sarasvati1 one of the rivers. If the former passages are to be treated as precise, then saptasvasa1 may be considered to show that the Sarasvati1 was outside the river system (which would then be Indus, Kubha1, and the five rivers of the Panjab; see Sapta Sindhavah2); but the expression may be loosely meant for one of seven sisters. clearly designate a district: it is most probable that they are not the five rivers with the Indus and the Kubha1 (Cabul river), but the five rivers, the Indus and the Sarasvati1. Nor is it difficult to see why the river is said to flow to the sea: either the Vedic poet had never followed the course of the river to its end, or the river did actually penetrate the desert either completely or for a long distance, and only in the Bra1hman2a period was its disappear ance in the desert found out. It is said, indeed, in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 21) xxxiv. 11. that the five rivers go to the Sarasvati1, but this passage is not only late (as the use of the word Des4a shows), but it does not say that the five rivers meant are those of the Panjab. Moreover, the passage has neither a parallel in the other Sam2hita1s, nor can it possibly be regarded as an early production; if it is late it must refer to the later Sarasvati1. Hillebrandt, 22) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 99 et seq.; 3, 372-378. on the whole, adopts this view of the Sarasvati1, 23) He sees this sense in the Rigveda everywhere, except in the passages indicated in notes 24 and 25. but he also sees in it, besides the designation of a mythical stream, the later Vaitaran2i1, 24) vii. 95, 6; x. 17, 7; Av. vii. 68, 2; xiv. 2, 20; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxxv. 10, 11. as well as the name of the Arghandab in Arachosia. 25) Rv. vi. 49, 7; 61; possibly Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxxiv. 11. This opinion depends essentially on his theory that the sixth Man2d2ala of the Rigveda places the scene of its action in Iranian lands, as opposed to the seventh Man2d2ala: it is as untenable as that theory itself. 26) See Divoda1sa. Brunnhofer 27) Bezzenberger's Beitra7ge, 10, 261, n. 2. at one time accepted the Iranian identification, but later 28) Iran und Turan, 127. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 337 et seq., Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 141, 142; Vedic Mythology, pp. 86-88; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 84, 164. decided for the Oxus, which is quite out of the question.

 denotes in the Rigveda, 1) x. 162, 3. and often later, 2) Av. iii. 10, 6: xix. 7, 1; 48, 3, etc. any ‘creeping animal’ or ‘reptile.’

सर्प
सर्प,
 ‘serpent,’ occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 16, 6. where Ahi is the usual word, but often later. 2) Av. x. 4, 23; xi. 3, 47; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 4, 1; iii. 1, 1, 1, etc.

सर्पराज्ञी

 ‘serpent-queen,’ is the alleged authoress of a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 189. according to the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1. 2) i. 5, 4, 1; vii. 3, 1, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 6, 6; ii. 2, 6, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 23, 1, 2.

सर्पविद्या
सर्प-विद्या,
 the ‘science of snakes,’ is enumerated in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a among branches of learning. It must have been reduced to fixed rules, since a section (parvan) of it is referred to as studied. The Gopatha Bra1hman2a 2) i. 1, 10. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 367, n. 3. has the form Sarpa-veda. ^1 xiii. 4, 3, 9. Cf. S4a1nkha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvi. 2, 25. The A1s4vala1yana Srauta Su1tra, x. 7, 5, has Vis2a-vidya1, and the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (vii. 1. 2. 4; 2, 1; 4, 1; 7, 1) has sarpadevajana-vidya1.

सर्पिवात्सि
सर्पि वात्सि
 (‘descendant of Vatsa’) is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) vi. 24, 15. Aufrecht, Altareya Bra1hman2a, 424, takes the name to be Sarpir. The point is, of course, doubtful, since the word occurs in the nominative only.

सर्पिस्
सर्पिस्
 denotes ‘melted butter,’ whether in a liquid or solidified condition, and not differing from Ghr2ta according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Roth there rejects the definition cited by Sa1yan2a in his commentary on the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 1) i. 3, 5. which discriminates Sarpis as the liquid and Ghr2ta as the solid condition of the butter. The word is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 2) i. 127, 1; v. 6, 9; x. 18, 7. and later. 3) Av. i. 15, 4; ix. 6, 41; x. 9, 12; xii. 3, 45; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 10, 1, etc. 

सर्वचरु
सर्व-चरु
 is found in a passage of the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) vi. 1, 1. and of the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, 2) xxix. 1. where the gods are referred to as holding a sacrifice sarvacarau. The word is the name of a man according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary; the name of a place 3) Sa1yan2a on Aitareya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. seems possible, or even a mere adjective may be meant. 4) Aufrecht, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 425, n. 1, who suggests that yajn5e is to be supplied.

सर्ववेदस
सर्व-वेदस
 denotes in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as either a sacrifice in which the sacrificer gives his all to the priests, 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 7, 7; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxv. 14; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 3, 1. or the whole property of a man. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 1, 1, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 8, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 7, 15; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 6, 1, 15, etc.

सर्षप
सर्षप,
 denoting ‘mustard’ or ‘mustard seed,’ occurs only a few times in later Vedic texts. 1) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iii. 14, 3. Cf. S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, v. 2; S4a1n3kha1yana Srauta Su1tra, iv. 15, 8, etc. It is common in the later language.

सलिलवात
सलिल-वात
 occurs in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 4, 12, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxiv. 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 16, 4. as an adjective meaning ‘favoured with a wind from the water.’ 2) Or, according to the commentator, salila1khyena va1ta-vis4es2en2a anugr2hi1tah2, ‘favoured by a kind of wind called Salila.’ It probably refers to the wind from the ocean, the south-west monsoon. 3) Indian Empire, 1, 110. The monsoon is little noted in the Vedic texts, except in so far as the Marut hymns may be deemed to be a description of the monsoon. See Rv. i. 19, 7; 37, 6 et seq.; 38, 8; 64, 8; 88, 5; v. 83, 1 et seq.; 85, 4; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 42-44. 

सल्व
सल्व
 is the name of a people mentioned in a passage of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) x. 4, 1, 10. which records a boast by S4ya1parn2a Sa1yaka1yana that if a certain rite of his had been completed, his race would have been the nobles, Brahmins, and peasants of the Salvas, and even as it was his race would surpass the Salvas. This people appears also to be alluded to as Sa1lvi1h2 (praja1h2) in the Mantra Pa1t2ha, 2) ii. 11, 12. where they are said to have declared that their king was Yaugandhari when they stayed their chariots 3) Winternitz, Mantra-pa1t2ha, xlv-xlvii, sees in the verse an allusion to the Sa1lva women turning round the wheel (? spinning-wheel). But a reference to a warlike raid seems more plauaible. on the banks of the Yamuna1. There is later evidence 4) Maha1bha1rata, iv. 1, 12; viii. 44 (45), 14. The Yugandharas are also referred to in a Ka1rika1 quoted in the Ka1s4ika1 Vr2tti on Pa1n2ini, iv. 1, 173. indicating that the Sa1lvas or S4a1lvas were closely connected with the Kuru-Pan5ca1las, and that apparently some of them, at least, were victorious near the banks of the Yamuna1. There is no good evidence to place them in the north-west in Vedic times. 5) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 215. Later, they may have been found in Ra1jastha1n, Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 760.

सव्यष्ठा
सव्य-ष्ठा,
 1) Av. viii. 8, 23. Savya-s2t2hr2, 2) Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 2, 4, 9; 3, 1, 8; 4, 3, 17, 18. Savye-s2t2ha, 3) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a. i. 7, 9, 1. and Savya-stha 4) Ka1n2va recension of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 8. are all various forms of the word for ‘car-fighter,’ as opposed to Sa1rathi, ‘charioteer,’ showing that, as was natural, the fighter stood on the left of the driver. The commentators 5) On S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 8; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, loc. cit. are inclined to see in the Savyas2t2ha1 merely another ‘charioteer,’ but this is quite unjustifiable, 6) Eggeling, loc. cit.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 235. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296. and is perhaps due to later caste prejudice against a S4u1dra charioteer.

सस
सस
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 51, 3; x. 79, 3. denotes ‘herb’ or ‘grass.’ 1) i. 51, 3; x. 79, 3. The word is also applied to the Soma plant 2) iii. 5, 6; iv. 5, 7, etc. and the sacrificial straw. 3) v. 21, 4. 

ससर्परी
ससर्परी
 is a word occurring in two curious verses of the Rigveda. 1) iii. 53, 15, 16. According to a later interpretation, 2) Br2haddevata1, iii. 113, with Macdonell's notes. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 159. it designates a particular kind of skill in speech which Vis4va1mitra obtained from Jamadagni. What it was is quite uncertain.

सस्य
सस्य
 in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 11, 1; viii. 10, 24. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 3, 3; v. 1, 7, 3; vii. 5, 20, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 2, 2, etc. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 284. regularly denotes ‘corn’ generally. It corresponds to the Avestan hahya. See Kr2s2i.

सह
सह
 in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 6, 15. Cf. Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 10. is, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2b. the name of a plant, but Bloomfield 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 648. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 642; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. thinks the word is only an adjective meaning ‘mighty.’

सहदेव
सह-देव
 is the name of a prince in the Rigveda, 1) i. 100, 17. where he is victorious over the S4imyus and Dasyus. It is quite probable that he is identical with King Sahadeva Sa1rn5jaya, who is mentioned in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 2) ii. 4, 4, 3. 4. Cf. xii. 8, 2, 3. as having once been called Suplan Sa1rn5jaya, and as having changed his name because of his success in performing the Da1ks2a1yan2a sacrifice. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 3) vii. 34, 9. he is mentioned with Somaka Sahadevya, who also appears in the Rigveda. 4) iv. 15, 7 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 132; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105, 106.

सहदेवी
सह-देवी
 is the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 59, 2. Cf. Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 163; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 325; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 490, who does not accept this reading. A plant called Sahadeva occurs in the Sa1mavidha1na Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 10. according to the reading of the commentary. 

सहमान
सहमान
 is the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda (ii. 25, 2; iv. 17, 2; viii. 2, 6; 7, 5).

सहोजित्

सांवरणि
सांवरणि
 is found in the Rigveda 1) viii. 51, 1. in one passage, where it naturally seems to be a patronymic (‘descendant of Sam2varan2a’) of Manu. According to Bloomfield, 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 180, n. it is a corruption for Sa1varn2i, a reference to Manu's birth from the savarn2a1, ‘similar’ female who was substituted for Saran2yu1 according to the legend (see Manu). This is possible, but not certain. Scheftelowitz 3) Die Apokryphen des R2gveda, 38. thinks that the reading of the Kas4mir manuscript of the Rigveda, which has sa1m2varan2am, ‘found on the sacrificial ground,’ as an epithet of Soma, is to be preferred. But this seems quite improbable. 4) See Oldenberg, Go7ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1907, 237. We must either recognize a real man called Manu Sa1m2varan2i; or take Manu as one name, Sa1m2varan2i as another; or admit that Manu Sa1m2varan2i is simply Manu with a patronymic derived from an unknown legend.

A Sa1m2kr2tya occurs also in the Taittiri1ya Pra1tis4a1khya, viii. 21; x. 21; xvi. 16. 

साचीगुण
साची-गुण
 is mentioned, apparently as a place in the territory of the Bharatas, in a verse occurring in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 1) viii. 23, 4. Leumann, 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 80, n. 5. This conjecture seems improbable. however, thinks an epithet of Indra, S4a1ci1gu, may be meant.

सांजीवीपुत्र
सांजीवी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of Sa1m2ji1vi1,’ is the name of a teacher who appears in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) at the end of the tenth Ka1n2d2a of the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 1) x. 6, 5, 9. and at the end of the fourteenth Ka1n2d2a in the Ka1n2va recension, 2) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 5. 4 Ka1n2va. as a pupil of Ma1n2d2u1ka1yani. In the Vam2s4as at the end of the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad in both recensions 3) Ibid., vi. 4, 32 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 5, 2 Ka1n2va). Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxiv et seq.; We4ber, Indian Literature, 131. he is given as a pupil of Pra1s4ni1putra A1suriva1sin. It seems clear that he united in himself two lines of teachers--that of the tradition of the firecult from S4a1n2d2ilya, and that of the tradition of Ya1jn5avalkya.

A1s4vala1yana 6) Su1tra, ix. 9, 14. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 230, 295, 296; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 358; Keith, Aitareya A1ran2yaka, 177; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 564. knows sa1dya as a ‘riding horse’ opposed to vahya, a ‘draught animal.’

साधारणी
साधारणी
 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 167, 4. seems to refer not so much to an uxor communis, like Draupadi1 in the Epic, as Max Mu7ller 2) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 277. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 332; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 461; Pischel and Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, xxv. suggests, but to a courtezan. 

साप्त
साप्त
 in the Rigveda 1) viii. 55, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 552; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 266. may be a proper name, but the sense is quite uncertain.

सार्ञ्जय
 is found in the Rigveda 1) vi. 47, 25. in a Da1nastuti (‘praise of gifts’) where the word probably denotes the ‘Sr2n5jaya king’ rather than a ‘descendant of Sr2n5jaya.’ According to the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 2) xvi. 11, 11. he was Prastoka, mentioned, in the same hymn, but this conclusion is not very cogent.

Sa1la1vr2keya 3) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, viii. 1, 4; xiii. 4, 16; xiv. 11, 28; xviii. 1, 9; xix. 4, 7; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 185 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 123); Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 5; xi. 10; xxv. 6; xxxvi. 7 (Indische Studien, 3, 465, 466); Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 1 (according to S4an3kara1nanda's recension). In Av. ii. 27, 5, Indra is alluded to as an enemy of the Sa1la1vr2kas. is a variant form of the same word, meaning literally ‘descendant of a Sa1la1vr2ka.’ The feminine is Sa1la1vr2ki1, 4) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 4. but in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 5) vi. 2, 7, 5; also in Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 8, 3; A1pastamba Dharma Su1tra, i. 10, 17; 11, 33. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 192; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 68; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 306, who decides in favour of ‘jackal.’ it appears as Sala1vr2ki1. Cf. Taraks2u. 

सावयस
सावयस
 (‘descendant of Savayasa’) is the patronymic of As2a1d2ha, or A1s2a1d2ha, in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (i. 1, 1, 7).

सावर्णि
सा-वर्णि
 is found as a patronymic in the Rigveda 1) x. 62, 11. together with Sa1varn2ya. 2) x. 62, 9. It is clear that no man called Savarn2a ever existed, though Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 17. accepted that view, and that the reference is to the mythical Manu Sa1varn2i, the descendant of the sa-varn2a1 female, who, according to the legend, 4) Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society 15, 179 et seq. took the place of Saran2yu1.

सिंह
सिंह
 denotes the ‘lion’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 64, 8; 95, 5; iii. 2, 11; 9, 4; 26, 5; iv. 16, 14, etc. and later. 2) Av. iv. 36, 6; v. 20, 1, 2; 21, 6; viii. 7, 15; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 21, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 10, etc.; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 9; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, 1, 2. The roaring (nad) of the lion is often alluded to, 2) Av. iv. 36, 6; v. 20, 1, 2; 21, 6; viii. 7, 15; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 21, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 10, etc.; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 9; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, 1, 2. and is called thundering (stanatha). 4) Rv. v. 83, 3; Av. v. 21, 6; viii. 7, 15. He wanders about (ku-cara) and lives in the hills (giri-s2t2ha), 5) Rv. i. 154, 2; x. 160, 2. and is clearly the ‘dread wild beast that slays’ (mr2go bhi1ma upahatnuh2) 6) Rv. ii. 33, 11. to which Rudra is compared. When Agni, who has entered the waters, is compared to a lion, 7) Rv. iii. 9, 4. the reference may be to the lion's habit of springing on animals at drinking places. That a jackal should defeat the lion is spoken of as a marvel. 8) Rv. x. 28, 4. The lion, being dangerous to men, 9) Rv. i. 174, 3. was trapped, 10) Rv. x. 28, 10. lain in wait for in ambush, 11) Rv. v. 74, 4. or chased by hunting bands. 12) Rv. v. 15, 3. Cf. Strabo, xv, 1, 31. But dogs were terrified of lions. 13) Av. v. 36, 6. The liones (sim2hi1) was also famous for her courage: the aid given by Indra to Suda1s against the vast host of his enemies is compared to the defeat of a lioness by a ram (Petva). 14) Rv. vii. 18, 17. The gaping jaws of the lioness when attacking men are alluded to in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 15) vi. 35, 1. The lioness is also mentioned in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 16) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 2, 12, 2; vi. 2, 7, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, v. 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 5, 1, 21; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 8, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 78, 79. See also Hali1ks2n2a.

सिच्
1. Sic denotes the ‘border’ of a garment. The Rigveda refers to a son clutching the hem of his father's robe to attract his attention, 1) iii. 53, 2. and to a mother's covering her son with the edge of her garment. 2) x. 18, 11. The word also occurs later. 3) Av. xiv. 2, 51; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 1, 18.

सिच्
2. Sic denotes, in the dual, the ‘wings’ of an army, 1) Rv. x. 75, 4. or, in the plural, the ‘lines.’ 2) Av. xi. 9, 18; 10, 20. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 65; Geldner, ibid., 3, 31.

सिच्
3. Sic seems in one passage of the Rigveda (i. 95, 7), where it is used in the dual, to denote the ‘horizon’ (meaning literally the ‘two borders’; i.e., of heaven and of earth).

सिध्मल
सिध्मल,
 ‘leprous,’ is found in the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1 (xxx. 17) and the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a (iii. 4, 14, 1) as a designation of one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’). Cf. Kila1sa.

सिनीवाली
सिनीवाली
 denotes the day of new moon and its presiding spirit, which, in accordance with widespread ideas concerning the connexion of the moon and vegetation, is one of fertility and growth. It occurs very frequently from the Rigveda 1) ii. 32, 7, 8; x. 184, 2. onwards. 2) Av. ii. 26, 2; vi. 11, 3; ix. 4, 14; xiv. 2, 15; xix. 31, 10; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 6, 2; iii. 4, 9, 1. 6; v. 5, 17, 1; 6, 18, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxv. 2, etc. Cf.

सिन्धु
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 97, 8; 125, 5; ii. 11, 9; 25, 3, 5; iii. 53, 9, etc. and the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 13, 1; iv. 24, 2; x. 4, 15; xiii. 3, 50, etc. often means ‘stream’ merely (cf. Sapta Sindhavah2), but it has also 3) Rv. i. 122, 6; 126, 1; iv. 54, 6; 55, 3; v. 53, 9; vii. 95, 1; viii. 12, 3; 25, 14; 20, 25; 26, 18; x. 64, 9; Av. xii. 1, 3; xiv. 1, 43; perhaps also vi. 24, 1; vii. 45, 1; xix. 38, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, viii. 59. the more exact sense of ‘the stream’ par excellence, ‘the Indus.’ The name is, however, rarely mentioned after the period of the Sam2hita1s, 4) The Sindhu-Sauvi1ras occur in the Baudha1yana Dharma Su1tra, i. 2, 14. Cf. Bu7hler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 148; Oldenberg, Buddha, 394, n. always then occurring in such a way as to suggest distance. The horses from the Indus (saindhava) were famous. 5) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 2, 15 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 1, 13 Ka1n2va). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 16, 17, 27. See Saindhava.

सिरी
 in the Rigveda (x. 71, 9) seems to denote a ‘female weaver.’

सिलाची

 is, in the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 5, 1, 8. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 419; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 228. the name of a healing plant, also called La1ks2a1.

सिलाञ्जाला
सिलाञ्जाला,
 which the commentator reads as S4ala1n5ja1la1, is the name of a plant, perhaps a ‘grain creeper,’ in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 16, 4. The Kaus4ika Su1tra 2) ii. 16. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 466; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292, 293. reads the word as S4ila1n5ja1la1. Cf. Sila1ei1. 

सीचापू
सीचापू
 in the list of victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda 1) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 19, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 25. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94. seems to denote a kind of bird.

सीता
सीता,
 ‘furrow,’ occurs in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 57, 6. 7 (the most agricultural of Rigvedic hymns, and probably late). and often later. 2) Av. xi. 3, 12; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 5, 4. 5; 6, 2, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xx. 3, etc. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86, n.

सीमन्
सीमन्
 denotes the ‘parting’ of the hair in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 8, 13. and later. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 7, 4; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 1; xv. 5, 20; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 4, 1, 14. Cf. si1manta in Av. vi. 134, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 17, 3.

सीर
सीर,
 ‘plough,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 57, 8; x. 101, 3, 4. and often later. 2) Av. vi. 30, 1; 91, 1; viii. 9, 16, etc.; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 1, 2; ii. 5, 8, 12; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 7; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 11, 4. It was large and heavy, as is shown by the fact that six oxen, 3) Av. vi. 91, 1; viii. 9, 16; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 2, 5, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 2; xx. 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 2, 2, 6; xiii. 8, 2, 6. or eight, 4) Av. vi. 91, 1. or twelve, 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 7, 1; v. 2, 5, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 2, etc. or even twenty-four, 6) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 244. n. 1. were used to drag it. The animals which drew the plough were oxen, which were, no doubt, yoked and harnessed with traces. 7) Varatra1 is found in Rv. iv. 57, 4, and (of the ox in the Mudgala story) in x. 102, 8. It may denote the fastening of the ox to the yoke rather than to the plough by traces. The ox was guided by the As2t2ra1, or ‘goad,’ of the ploughman (cf. Vais4ya). 8) Cf. Rv. iv. 57, 4; x. 102, 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236, 237. Little is known of the parts of the plough. See La1n3gala and Pha1la.

सील
सील,
 ‘plough,’ is found in the Kapis2t2hala Sam2hita1 (xxviii. 8). 

सीलमावती
सीलमावती
 in the Rigveda 1) x. 75, 8. is, according to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. the name of a river; but this is most improbable. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 429; Bo7htlingk, Dictionary, s.v.; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 195. Sa1yan2a thinks the word means ‘rich in hemp.’

सीस
सीस,
 ‘lead,’ occurs first in the Atharvaveda, 1) xii. 2, 1. 19 et seq., 53. where it is mentioned as used for amulets. 2) i. 16, 2, 4. The word is then quite common. 3) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xviii. 13; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 12, 6, 5; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 2, 14; 4, 1, 9; xii. 7, 1, 7; 2, 10; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, iv. 17, 7, etc. The use of lead by the weaver as a weight is perhaps also referred to. 4) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 80; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 9; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 4. This is the view of Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and of Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 53. But Griffith, Translation of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 183, n., thinks that in xix. 80 lead is referred to not as a weight, but as a charm against demons and sorcery. Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 157, 158.

सुकन्या
सु-कन्या
 is the name of S4arya1ta's daughter, who married Cyavana according to the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 1) iv. 1, 5, 6; 10, 13; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 121 et seq.

 (‘descendant of Kaks2i1vant’) is the name of a R2s2i to whom the Bra1hman2as of the Rigveda 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 15, 4; vi. 29, 1; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxx. 5. ascribe the authorship of a Vedic hymn. 2) x. 131.

सुचित्तशैलन
सु-चित्त शैलन
 is the name of a teacher in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (i. 14, 4).

सुजात
सु-जात,
 ‘well-born,’ is an epithet found applied to men in a few passages of the Rigveda. It would probably be a mistake to press the sense so as to denote ‘nobles’ as compared with the people. See Sabha1. ^1 ii. 2, 11; v. 6, 2; vii. 1, 4. 15; viii. 20, 8.

सुतंभर
सुतं-भर
 is credited by the Anukraman2i1 (Index) with the authorship of certain hymns of the Rigveda. 1) v. 11-14. The word does not occur in those hymns, but it appears as an adjective (‘carrying away Soma’) elsewhere, 2) v. 44, 13. and may, in a second passage, 3) ix. 6, 6. by a conjecture 4) If sutam2-bhara1ya be read for sutdm2 bha4ra1ya, as Roth suggests in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. be taken as a man's name.

सुत्वन्कैरिशिभार्गायण
सुत्वन् कैरिशि भार्गायण
 is, in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (viii. 28, 18), the name of a king who, being taught a spell by Maitreya Kaus2a1rava, slew five kings and became great.

सुदामन्
सु-दामन्
 is the name of a river in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xxii. 18, 1).

सुदास्
सु-दास्
 is the name of the Tr2tsu king who won a famous victory over the ten kings, as described in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) vii. 18. See also Rv. vii. 20, 2; 25, 3; 32, 10; 33, 3; 64, 3; 83, 1 et seq. At one time Vis4va1mitra was his Purohita, and accompanied him in his victorious raids over the Vipa1s4 (Bea1s) and S4utudri1 (Sutlej). 2) Rv. iii. 53, 9, 11. See also Vis4va1mitra and Vas2is2t2ha. The As4vins gave him a queen, Sudevi1, 3) Rv. i. 112, 19. and also helped him on another occasion. 4) Rv. i. 47, 9, where, however, Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1, takes su-da1s as an adjective (‘worshipping well’). He appears with Trasadasyu in a late hymn without hint of rivalry, 5) Rv. vii. 19, 3. but elsewhere he seems to be referred to as defeated by Purukutsa, Trasadasyu's father. 6) Rv. i. 63, 7, reading Suda1sam for Suda1se with Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 174. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 112, n. 1; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 153; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 63. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 7) vii. 34, 9. he is recognized as a great king, with Vasis2t2ha as his Puro hita, and similarly in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, 8) xvi. 11, 14. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 107 et seq.; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 31 et seq. where his generosity to his priest is related. His exact ancestry is a little uncertain, because he is called Paijavana, ‘son of Pijavana,’ as Ya1ska explains the patronymic. If this explanation is correct, Divoda1sa must have been his grandfather. If he was the son of Divoda1sa, Pijavana must be understood as a more remote ancestor. The former alternative seems the more probable. Cf. Turvas4a, Da1s4ara1jn5a. Paijavana, Bharata, Sauda1sa.

सुदेव
1. Su-deva is, according to Ludwig, 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160. the proper name of a sacrificer in one hymn of the Rigveda. 2) viii. 5, 6. 

सुदेवकाश्यप
2. Su-deva Ka1s4yapa (‘descendant of Kas4yapa’) is the name of a teacher in the Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka 1) ii. 18. Cf. x. 1, 8; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 188, n.; 10, 103. who set forth the expiation for lack of chastity.

सुपर्ण
1. Su-parn2a, ‘well-winged,’ designates a large bird of prey, the ‘eagle’ or the ‘vulture,’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 20; ii. 42, 2; iv. 26, 4; viii. 100, 8; ix. 48, 3, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 24, 1; ii. 27. 2; 30, 3; iv. 6, 3, etc.; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 5, 8, 5, etc. In the passages in which it appears as an eater of carrion 3) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 9, 19; Taittiri1ya A1ran2yaka, iv. 29. it must be the vulture. The Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a 4) ii. 438 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 101). mentions an eagle which separates milk from water like the Krun5c. In the Rigveda 5) x. 144, 4. the Suparn2a is said to be the child of the S4yena, and is distinguished from the latter in another passage: 6) ii. 42, 2. this led Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 88. to think that the falcon is probably meant. 8) In the post-Vedic period Suparn2a became a mythical bird, identified with Vis2nu's vehicle, Garud2a, who, however, is also regarded as king of the Suparn2as. The Atharvaveda alludes to its cry, 9) ii. 30, 3. and describes it as living in the hills. 10) v. 4, 2. 

सुपर्ण
2. Suparn2a is personified in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 3, 3, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxix. 7. as a R2s2i.

सुपित्र्य
सु-पित्र्य,
 a word occurring once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 115, 6. is probably an adjective (‘maintaining his paternal character well’). Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 169. however, regards it, but without any great probability, as a proper name.

सुप्रतीतऔलुण्ड्य

Cf. Le4vi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 139; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105, 106.

सुबन्धु
सु-बन्धु
 in the hymns of the Rigveda 1) x. 59, 8; 60, 7, 10. is taken by Sa1yan2a to be a proper name; but this is not certain, Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1. seeing in the passages only an ordinary noun meaning ‘a good friend.’ The later tradition 3) Br2haddevata1, vii. 83 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. See also Asama1ti, n. 1. explains that Subandhu and his brothers, called Gaupa1yanas, were priests of Asama1ti, who cast them off and took two others, Kira1ta and A1kuli. By these two in pigeon form Subandhu was caused to swoon, but was revived by his three brothers, who recited certain hymns. 4) Rv. x. 57-60. Cf.

Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 362, 374. denotes a priest who officiates as one of the three assistants of the Udga1tr2 (see R2tvij). His office is Subrahman2ya1. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vi. 3, 1-7. 11, 12; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxvii. 6, etc. The priest himself is so styled, Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 1, 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xviii. 9, 19, etc.

Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 8, 3); Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 12, 20. as in some way connected with the rite. Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 183, 184; Indian Literature, 114, 115. Cf. Griffith, Translation of the Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, 212, n. thinks that a proper name, that of the wife of the king of Ka1mpi1la, is intended, but Mahi1dhara 3) On Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, loc. cit. explains the word merely as a lady with many lovers or a courtezan, a view followed by Roth. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. subhadraka, 2b; Bo7htlingk's Dictionary, s.v. 2a. Since the Taittiri1ya 5) vii. 4, 19, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 6. and Ka1t2haka 6) As4vamedha, iv. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 36, 37; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 321, 322. Sam2hita1s have no Subhadrika1, but a vocative subhage (see Subhaga1), the sense remains very doubtful.

Cf. Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xix. 1, 20-27; Mahi1dhara on Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 1. holds, or, as Whitney 9) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 207. Cf.

See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 251, who attempts to show that Sura1 and Soma were rival priestly drinks at one time, belonging to different sections of the people. It was kept in skins. 12) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiv. 11, 26. Cf. Rv. i. 191, 10. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 121.

Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 42; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 11, 4; iv. 12, 5. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 245 et seq., renders it ‘Sura1 mixed,’ which is doubtful. was treated as an epithet of Soma, meaning ‘delightful.’

सुवर्ण
सु-वर्ण,
 ‘beautiful coloured,’ is an epithet of gold (Hiran2ya), and then comes to be used as a substantive denoting ‘gold.’ ^1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 7, 4; 8, 9, 1, etc. ^2) Av. xv. 1, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 12, 6, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xi. 4, 1, 8, etc.; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, i. 6, 6; iii. 19, 1; iv. 17, 7, etc.

सुषामन्
सु-षामन्
 is the name of a man in one verse of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 25, 22; possibly 60, 18. and probably forms part of the strange name, Varo Sus2a1man, in other passages. 2) viii. 23, 28; 24, 28; 26, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. Cf. Varu.

सुषोमा
सु-षोमा
 occurs certainly as the name of a river in the Nadi1stuti (‘praise of rivers’) in the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 5; Nirukta, ix. 26, where it is absurdly identified with the Sindu (Indus). In two other passages it would seem to be a proper name, once masculine, 2) viii. 7, 29. perhaps the people, and once feminine, 3) viii. 64, 11. though Roth 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. sees in the word the designation of a Soma vessel. Its identification is quite uncertain, though it has been thought to be the  of Megasthenes, 5) See Arrian, Indica, iv. 12; Schwanbeck, Megasthenes, 31, where there is a various reading . Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 126 et seq.; Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 398, 399; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 12-14. the modern Suwan.

 is the name of a river in the Nadi1-stuti (‘praise of rivers’) in the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. That it was a tributary of the Indus is certain, but which one is unknown.

सु-हविस् आङ्गिरस
 (‘descendant of An3giras’) is the name of the seer of a Sa1man or chant in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a (xiv. 3, 25).

सूकर
सू-कर
 ‘wild-boar,’ has the appearance of being an onomatopoetic word (‘making the sound su1’); it is more probably a very old word going back to the Indo-European period, and cognate with the Latin su-culus (‘little pig’), being transformed in sense by popular etymology. 1) The su1- corresponding to Lat. su1-s, Gk. -s, Old High German, su1. Cf. Brugmann, Grundriss, 2^2, 483. It occurs in the Rigveda 2) vii. 55, 4. and later. 3) Av. ii. 27, 2; v. 14, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 21; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 40; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, v. 10, 2, etc. None of the passages refer to the flesh as eaten: Buddha's death was due to a meal of su1karamaddava, which may well mean ‘tender parts of pork’ (see Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 881, n.), though the Ra1janighan2t2u, vii. 85, gives su1kara as meaning the Batatas edulis. It appears once in the Atharvaveda accompanied by mr2ga, 4) xii. 1, 48. The use of mr2ga here does not indicate that su1kara is a new name, because the latter word elsewhere always occurs alone both in the Rigveda and later (n. 3). Cf. Mr2ga above, 2, 172, n. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 100. the combined words apparently meaning ‘wild hog,’ as opposed to Vara1ha, ‘boar.’ 

सूक्त
सूक्त,
 ‘well uttered,’ is the regular term for a ‘hymn’ as part of the S4astra in the later Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 4, 5, 5; vii. 1, 5, 4, etc. and the Bra1hman2as. 2) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 33; iii. 11, 9. 12-15; iv. 21, 5; vi. 8, 10; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1; xv. 3; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 1, 18; Nirukta, iv. 6; xi. 16. The sense of ‘hymn’ must also be recognized in several passages of the Rigveda. 3) i. 42, 20; 171, 1; ii. 6, 2; vii. 29, 3, etc.

सूची
सूची,
 ‘needle,’ is found in the Rigveda 1) ii. 32, 4. and later. 2) Av. xi. 10, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiii. 33; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 6, 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 18, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 10, 2. 3; Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 10; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, i. 10, 3 (Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 228).

सूचीक
सूचीक
 is the name of a stinging insect in the Rigveda. 1) i. 191, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

सूत
सूत
 is the name of a court official who is often mentioned with the Gra1man2i1. He is one of the eight Vi1ras in the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, 1) ix. 1, 4, where he follows the chief queen (Mahis2i1), and precedes the Gra1man2i1 in the list. and of the eleven Ratnins in other texts. 2) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 4; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 3, 1; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 9, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 5. He also appears in the Atharvaveda 3) iii. 5, 7. among the kingmakers (Ra1jakr2t) and in the S4atrarudriya 4) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 2, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 18. So also in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’), Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 2, 1. For other references to the Su1ta, see Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 18, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 7; xiii. 4, 2, 5; 7, 1, 43; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 3; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 3, 37, 38. (‘section dealing with the hundred Rudras’) of the Yajurveda. The commentators are agreed in seeing in him the ‘charioteer’ (Sa1rathi) or ‘master of the horse,’ of the king; this sense is accepted by Roth, 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. by Whitney, 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 62. and by Bloomfield. 7) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 114. But the fact that the Sam2 grahi1tr2, who occurs in several passages beside the Su1ta, is the ‘charioteer,’ renders this version improbable. Eggeling 8) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 1. thinks that he was, in the Bra1hman2as at least, a minstrel and court poet, while Weber 9) Indische Studien, 17, 200. considers that his name denotes him as ‘consecrated’--that is, one who has constant access to the king. In the Epic the Su1ta serves as a royal herald and bard: 10) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 254, 255. it may be that the curious words ahanti, 11) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 18. This word means ‘non-fighter’ according to Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 200. ahantya, 12) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 2, 1. or ahantva 13) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 3. applied to him 14) The last two forms appear to be equivalent in sense to ahanya, ‘not to be slain,’ ‘inviolable.’ in the S4atarudriya denote his sacred character at once as minstrel and as herald--a combination of functions not unknown elsewhere.

सूतवशा
सूत-वशा
 denotes in the Yajurveda 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 5, 4; vi. 1, 3, 6; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvii. 5; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 7, 4, 1, etc. a cow barren after having one calf.

सूत्र
सूत्र
 has the sense of ‘thread’ in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 9, 3; xviii. 8, 37. and later. 2) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 4, 14; vii. 3, 2, 13; xii. 3, 4, 2; 7, 2, 10; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vi. 8, 2; Nirukta, iv. 6. In the sense of a ‘book of rules’ for the guidance of sacrificers and so forth, the word occurs in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 3) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6 (Ma1dhyam2dina = iv. 1, 2 Ka1n2va); 5, 11. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 24, 25; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des R2gveda, 21.

सूद
सूद,
 according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, means ‘well’ 1) Rv. vii. 36, 3; ix. 97, 4. and the ‘mud of a dried-up pool.’ 2) Rv. x. 61, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvi. 13; Taittiri1ya bra1hman2a, i. 1, 3, 5; 2, 1, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 7, 3, 21. Pischel, 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 72, 73. however, shows clearly that Su1da denotes what is added to Soma to make it fit for use, especially the warm milk, and this sense suits all the passages. Eggeling 4) Sacred Books of the East, 43, 144. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 211. renders it ‘well,’ and Grassmann ‘sweet drink.’

सूददोहस्
सूद-दोहस्
 in the Rigveda 1) viii. 69, 3. denotes ‘milking Su1da’--i.e., what is requisite to mix with Soma, according to Pischel. 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 72. Su1dayitnu in Rv. x. 64, 9, may be taken in the same way, and su1din in Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxvii. 2; su1dya in Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 13, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 25, etc. According to Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. it means ‘yielding milk like a well.’

सूना
सूना
 means, in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 10; 162, 13; x. 86, 18. and the Atharvaveda, 2) Av. v. 17, 14. Crates of Pala1s4a wood are mentioned in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xvii. 3, 2. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271. apparently a ‘woven (from si1v, ‘sew’) wickerwork basket’ for holding flesh.

सूनु
सूनु
 is a common word for ‘son’ from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 26, 3; ii. 38, 5; vi. 52, 9, etc.; Av. vi. 1, 2; vii. 2, 2; xii. 3, 23, etc. The etymological sense seems to be ‘he who is borne,’ and then ‘the begotten.’ 2) Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandischaftsnamen, 453. But the use of Su1nu in the Rigveda 3) Usually in a figurative sense--e.g sahasah2, adreh2 Su1ruh2. is predominantly in relation to the father, and only rarely in its connexion with words for mother. 4) v. 42, 2. Thus a father is ‘easy of access’ (sa1pa1yana) to his son (su1nu); 5) Rv. i. 1, 9. but in another passage, 6) Rv. x. 18, 11. where the same term is applied to earth as a mother, the word used for son is Putra. No conclusion as to matriarchy can of course be drawn from the etymology. On the relation of son and father, see Pitr2. 

सूरि
सूरि
 is the regular word in the Rigveda 1) i. 31, 7. 12; 48, 24; 54, 11; 73, 5. 8, 9; iii. 31, 14; v. 42, 4; 79, 6; vi. 4, 8; 23, 10; vii. 32, 15; viii. 70, 15; x. 61, 22; 115, 5. 7. 8. for the sacrificer, the later Yajama1na--that is, the man who pays the priests for performing the rite, and reaps the benefit of that service. The Su1ris are often coupled with the Maghavans, 1) i. 31, 7. 12; 48, 24; 54, 11; 73, 5. 8, 9; iii. 31, 14; v. 42, 4; 79, 6; vi. 4, 8; 23, 10; vii. 32, 15; viii. 70, 15; x. 61, 22; 115, 5. 7. 8. described as heroes or warriors, 2) i. 69, 3; 73, 9; 119, 3; 122, 12; 180, 9; vii. 32, 15. and as related to the priests by their patronage 3) i. 97, 3, 4; v. 10, 6; vi. 8, 7; 25, 7; vii. 3, 8; 44, 18; viii. 60, 6; x. 66, 2. or as companions. 4) v. 64, 5; vii. 32, 25; viii. 45, 36; ix. 96, 4; x. 115, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 236.

सूर्मि
सूर्मि
 denotes in the Rigveda 1) vii. 1, 3. and later, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 7, 6; v. 4, 7, 3; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxi. 9, where it is described as karn2aka1vati1, rendered by Roth as ‘provided with a handle.’ according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a kind of ‘tube’ serving as a lamp. In one passage of the Rigveda 3) viii. 69, 12. Su1rmya in Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 9, 2, may mean ‘being in pipes or channels.’ it means a ‘pipe’ for conveying water. Cf. Avata.

सूर्य
सूर्य,
 the ‘sun,’ plays a great part in Vedic mythology and religion, 1) See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 30 et seq. corresponding with the importance of the sun as a factor in the physical life of the peninsula. In the Rigveda 2) E.g., i. 50, 6; 115, 1. 3; 164, 11. 13; 191, 8. 9; vii. 63, 1; x. 37, 4; 85, 9; 88, 11; 139, 3, etc. the sun is normally regarded as a beneficent power, a not unnatural view in a people which must apparently have issued from the cold regions of the Hima1laya mountains. Its heat is, however, alluded to in some passages of the Rigveda, 3) Rv. vii. 34, 19; ix. 107, 20. as well as referred to in the Atharvaveda and the literature of the Bra1hman2as. 4) Ehni, Yama, 134; Macdonell, op. cit., p. 31. In one myth Indra is said to have vanquished Su1rya and to have stolen his wheel: 5) i. 175, 4; iv. 30, 4; x. 43, 5. this is possibly a reference to the obscuration of the sun by a thunderstorm. 6) Macdonell, loc. cit. The Aitareya Bra1hman2a 7) iii. 44, 4. presents a naive conception of the course of the sun, which it regards as bright on one side only, and as returning from west to east by the same road, but with the reverse side turned towards the earth, thus at night illumining the stars in heaven. 8) Macdonell, p. 10, who compares Rv. i. 115. 5; x. 37, 3. See also Speyer, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 723; Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 6. In the Rigveda 9) Rv. iv. 13, 5. wonder is expressed that the sun does not fall. There are several references to eclipses in the Rigveda. In one passage 10) Rv. v. 40, 5-9. Cf. Macdonell, p. 160; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 2; 6, 14; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 3; Tilak, Orion, 159. Svarbha1nu, a demon, is said to have eclipsed the sun with darkness, while Atri restores the light of the sun, a similar feat being elsewhere attributed to his family, the Atris. 11) Av. xiii. 2, 4, 12, 36; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 4, 21. In the Atharvaveda 12) Av. xix. 9, 10; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 351. Ra1hu appears for the first time in connexion with the sun. Indra's defeat of Su1rya 6) Macdonell, loc. cit. may also be explained as alluding to an eclipse; in two other passages 13) Rv. iv. 28, 2, 3; v. 33, 4. In x. 27 20, su1ro markah2 means, according to Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Zimmer, loc. cit., a demon of eclipse; but it may also mean the ‘cleansing’ sun. Av. ii. 10, 8, clearly refers to an eclipse. See Lanman, Festgruss an Roth, 187-190. such an interpretation seems at least probable. Ludwig 14) Proceedings of the Bohemian Academy of Sciences, May, 1885; Translation of the Rigveda, 6, x. not only argues that the Rigveda knows the theory of eclipses caused by an occultation of the sun by the moon, and regards the sun as going round the earth, 15) See Rv. iv. 28, 23; v. 33, 4; x. 37, 3 138, 4. but even endeavours to identify an eclipse referred to in the Rigveda with one that occurred in 1029 B.C. These views are completely refuted by Whitney. 16) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1885, xvii (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, lxilxvi); Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxii, lxxxiii; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 65, 66; Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 6. The sun as a maker of time 17) Rv. v. 81, 1. determines the year of 360 days, which is the civil year and the usual year (Sam2vatsara) of Vedic literature. This solar year is divided into two halves-the Uttara1yan2a, 18) The form Uttara1yan2a is later (Manu, vi. 10, etc.). Udagayana occurs in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 3, 1; Kaus4ika Su1tra, lxvii. 4; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 1, 1; Gobhila Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 1, 3; A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, i. 4, etc.; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 201, 212; Jyotis2a, 107 et seq.; Ya1ska, Nirukta, xiv. 10. when the sun goes north, and the Daks2in2a1yana, 19) The form is late (Manu, i. 67, etc.). In the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 3, the two Ayanas are equated each with three seasons--the northern course with spring, summer, and rains; the southern with autumn, winter, and cool season. But this is merely an inevitable inaccuracy, since no real season begins with the winter solstice. when it goes south. There can be no doubt that these periods denote the time when the sun turns north from the winter solstice, and when it turns south from the summer solstice, for the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a 20) xix. 3. Cf. Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 3; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 1, 18 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 2, 18 Ka1n2va); Weber, Naxatra, 2, 345 et seq. says so in perfectly clear language. The alternative theory is to regard the periods as those when the sun is in the north--i.e., when it is north of the equator, and when it is in the south, taking as points of departure the equinoxes, not the solstices; but this view has no support in Vedic literature, and is opposed to the fact that the equinoxes play no part in Vedic astronomical theory. 21) Thibaut, Indian Antiquary, 24, 96; Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik,  10; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 631 et seq.; 49, 473 et seq.; Nachrichten der ko7niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Go7ttingen, 1909, 564, n. 1; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1103. On the other side. see Tilak, Orion, 22-31. There are only doubtful references to the solstices in the Rigveda. 22) See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 279-283, who cites Rv. i. 61, 15; v. 29, 5; x. 171, 4; 179, 2. But none of these passages are conclusive. Cf. Thibaut, op. cit., 6. The Bra1hman2as, 23) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 6, 4, 18; iv. 6, 7, 12; x. 6, 2, 3; xi. 1, 6, 19; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, i. 2, 13; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 28, 8. and perhaps the Rigveda, 24) v. 47, 3; ix. 25, 6; 71, 2; x. 55, 5; 138, 4. Cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 463-466. regard the moon as entering the sun at new moon. According to Hillebrandt, 25) Ibid., 3, 467, 468. the Rigveda 26) ix. 71, 9; 76, 4; 86, 32; perhaps i. 190, 3; Sa1maveda, ii. 9, 2, 12, 1. Thibaut, op. cit., 6, considers that the meaning of the passages is merely that the moon is filled up during the bright half of the month by light emanating from the sun. recognizes that the moon shines by the borrowed light of the sun, but this seems very doubt ful. See also Aryamn2ah2 Pantha1, 27) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 188, finds in the Rigveda, i. 110, 2, a mention of the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator, and in x. 86, 4, a reference to the axis of the earth. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 158 et seq.; Oldenberg, R2gveda-Noten, 1, 102, 105. These views are clearly quite wrong. The notions of the sun given in the Bra1hman2as are all very naive and simple; the distance of heaven and the sun from the earth is the height of a thousand cows one on the top of the other (Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 8, 6), or forty-four days' journey for a horse (ibid., xxv. 10, 16), or a thousand days' journey for a horse (Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 17, 8), or a hundred leagues (Kausi1taki Bra1hman2a, viii. 3). They record also such facts as that the sun rises from and sets in the waters (Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iv. 20, 13; of. Nirukta, vi. 17; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 4, 5; xxvi. 1), and that it sets in the west (ibid., xviii. 9). The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a calls the sun circular (vii. 4, 1, 17), and also fourcornered (catuh2-s4rakti) in xiv. 3, 1, 17, and so on. See Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 358 et seq. Naks2atra, and Sapta Su1rya1h2.

सूर्यनक्षत्र
सूर्य-नक्षत्र
 is found in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 1, 2, 19. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 288. in a passage where Sa1yan2a takes it as denoting a Naks2atra, which gives out rays of light like the sun. But the real sense (as the Ka1n2va text helps to show) is that the sacrificer may take the sun for his Naks2atra--i.e., he may neglect the Naks2atras altogether and rely on the sun.

सूर्यचन्द्रमसा
सूर्य-चन्द्रमसा
 or Su1rya-candramasau denotes ‘sun and moon’ as a pair of luminaries in the Rigveda 1) i. 102, 2; v. 51, 15; x. 190, 3. and later. 2) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iii. 8, 9; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, vii. 12, 1. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 293; Jyotis2a 28, 50; Indische Studien, 9, 112.

सृक
सृक
 in a couple of passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 12; x. 180, 2. Cf. sr2ka1yin, sr2ka1-hasta, ‘bearing a lance in his hand,’ in the S4atarudriya, Va1jasaneya Sam2hita1, xvi. 21, 61, etc. denotes a weapon of Indra, perhaps a ‘lance.’

सृगाल
सृगाल
 , ‘jackal,’ is not found until the Satapatha Bra1hman2a xii. 5, 2, 5), but is common in the Epic. 

सृजय
सृजय
 is the name of one of the victims at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 14; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 23. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. What it was is unknown: Mahi1dhara on the Va1jasaneyi passage calls it a kind of bird; Sa1yan2a on the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1 gives the alternatives ‘black fly’ (when sr2jaya1 must be read), ‘white serpent,’ and ‘black buffalo.’

सृञ्जय
सृञ्जय
 is the name of a people mentioned as early as the Rigveda. Sr2n5jaya (that is, the king of this people) Daivava1ta is celebrated as victorious over the Turvas4as and the Vr2ci1vants, 1) Rv. vi. 27, 7. and his sacrificial fire is referred to. 2) Rv. iv. 15, 4. In connexion with Daivava1ta is also mentioned Sa1hadevya Somaka, 3) Rv. iv. 15, 7. no doubt another prince; for in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 4) vii. 34, 9. we find Somaka Sa1hadevya and his father, Sahadeva (originally Suplan) Sa1rn5jaya, as kings who were anointed by Parvata and Na1rada. The Rigveda 5) Rv. vi. 47, 22. 25. has also a Da1nastuti (‘praise of gifts’) of Prastoka, 6) Cf. S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Sutra, xvi. 11, 11. a Sr2n5jaya, who is lauded along with Divoda1sa. Moreover, Vi1tahavya 7) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. seems to have been a Sr2n5jaya, though Zimmer 8) Altindisches Leben, 132 (on vaitahavya). prefers to take the derivative word, Vaitahavya, not as a patronymic, but as an epithet. It seems probable that the Sr2n5jayas and the Tr2tsus were closely allied, for Divoda1sa and a Sr2n5jaya prince are celebrated together, 9) Cf. also the connexion of the Bharad va1jas and Divoda1sa (Rv. vi. 16, 5; 31, 4; Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 104), and their connexion with the Sr2n5jayas (Vi1tahavya in Rv. vi. 15, 2. 3, and see vi. 27, 7, both passages that can safely be accepted as derived from the Bharadva1ja family). and the Turvas4as were enemies of both. 10) See, on the one hand, Rv. vii. 18 (Turvas4as and Tr2tsus), and, on the other, vi. 27, 7. This view is borne out by the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, 11) ii. 4, 4, 5. which recognizes Devabha1ga S4rautars2a as Purohita of the Kurus and the Sr2n5jayas. On the other hand, some disaster certainly befel the Sr2n5jayas, at least the Vaitahavyas, for they are said in the Atharvaveda 12) v. 19, 1. Cf. v. 18, 10. 11. to have offended the Bhr2gus and to have ended miserably. There is, it is true, no precise confirmation of this notice, but both the Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1 13) xii. 3. and the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 14) vi. 6, 2, 2, 3. in independent passages, refer to the Sr2n5jayas having sustained some serious loss, though the notice is in each case coupled with a ritual error, much as in the Old Testament the fate of kings depends on their devotion to Jahve or their disobedience. It is justifiable to recognize some disaster in this allusion. The geographical position of the Sr2n5jayas is uncertain. Hillebrandt 15) Op. cit., 1, 106. suggests that in early times they must be looked for west of the Indus with Divoda1sa; he also mentions, though he does not definitely adopt, the suggestion of Brunnhofer that the Sr2n5jayas are to be compared with the  16) Herodotus has the form  and , Strabo and Arrian . The Avestic is zrayan3k, Old Persian daraya. The Indian s is curious if the words are parallel (see, however, Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 25, 11; Oldenberg, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1098). of the Greeks, and to be located in Drangiana. Zimmer 17) Altindisches Leben, 132, 133; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 232. This is a guess from Rv. i. 100, where Sahadeva occurs and the Sindhu is mentioned. is inclined to locate them on the upper Indus; but it is difficult to decide definitely in favour of any particular location. They may well have been a good deal farther east than the Indus, since their allies, the Tr2tsus, were in the Madhyades4a, and were certainly absorbed in the Kurus. Of the history of this clan we have one notice. 18) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq. They expelled Dus2t2ari1tu Paum2sa1yana, one of their kings, from the hereditary monarchy--of ten generations--and also drove out Revottaras Pa1t2ava Ca1kra Sthapati, probably his minister, who, however, succeeded in effecting the restoration of the king, despite the opposition of the Kuru prince, Balhika Pra1ti1pya. Very probably this Kuru prince may have been at the bottom of the movement which led to the expulsion of the king and his minister. But the restoration of the king can hardly be regarded, in accordance with Bloomfield's view, 19) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 433. So also Zimmer, op. cit., 132. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 208; 3, 472; 18, 237; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 31; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153; Oldenberg, Buddha 405. as a defeat of the Sr2n5jayas.

 is found certainly in one, 1) i. 58, 4, where sr2n2ya1, according to Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 116, n. 1, and to Pischel, ibid., 2, 111, stands for sr2n2ya1bhih2, and, as an adjective agreeing with juhu1bhih2, means ‘sickle-shaped sacrificial ladles.’ But this is very doubtful. and probably also in two other 2) x. 101, 3 (Nirukta, v. 28); 106, 6 (ibid., xiii. 5). It is certain in S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vii. 2, 2, 5. passages of the Rigveda. The sense appears to be ‘sickle.’ In one other passage Sr2n2ya is coupled with jeta1: 3) iv. 20, 5. the sense is doubtful, Roth 4) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 111. conjecturing ceta1, and Oldenberg 5) R2gveda-Noten, 1, 284. pointing out that chetta1 is also possible. Hopkins 6) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86, n. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238: Oldenberg, op. cit., 1, 58. thinks that a ‘hook’ is here meant.

सृबिन्द
सृबिन्द
 is the name of a foe of Indra 1) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 162. in the Rigveda. 2) viii. 32, 2. The word may denote a real foe, since it has no obvious A1ryan derivation.

सृमर
सृमर
 is the name of an unknown animal at the As4vamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita, v. 5, 16, 1 (according to Sa1yan2a = camara); Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 14, 20; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 39 (where Mahi1dhara identifies it with the Gavaya). 

सेतु
सेतु
 appears in the Rigveda 1) ix. 41, 2. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 2, 2, 1; vi. 1, 4, 9; 5, 3, 3; vii. 5, 8, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxviii. 4; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 35; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 2, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 2, 10, 1; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, iv. 4, 24; Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, viii. 4, 1. 2, etc. to denote merely a raised bank for crossing inundated land, 3) Max Mu7ller, Sacred Books of the East, 1, 130, n. 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 257. a ‘causeway,’ such as are common all the world over. This sense explains best the later meaning of ‘boundary.’ The word in Vedic literature is probably always metaphorical.

सेना
सेना
 denotes primarily a ‘missile,’ a sense found in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 66, 7; 116, 1 (sena1-ju1, ‘swift as an arrow’); 143, 5; 186, 9; ii. 33, 11; v. 30, 9; vii. 3, 4; viii. 75, 7; x. 23, 1. and the Atharvaveda, 2) viii. 8, 7; xi. 10, 4. and then a ‘host’ or ‘army,’ which is its normal meaning. 3) Rv. i. 33, 6; vii. 25, 1; ix. 96, 1; x. 103, 1. 4. 7; 142, 4; 156, 2; Av. iii. 1, 1; 19, 6; iv. 19, 2; v. 21, 9, etc. Cf. von Bradke, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 46, 456; Bloomfield, ibid., 48, 549, 550; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 231, n. 2, denies that Sena1 ever means ‘missile,’ and compares exercitus effusus, agmen effusum. See Sam2gra1ma.

सेनानी
सेना-नी,
 ‘leader of an army,’ is the title of the royal ‘general.’ He is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 20, 5; ix. 96, 1; x. 84, 2. where also 2) x. 34, 12 (the gambling hymn). the word is used metaphorically. He is also referred to in the S4atarudriya, 3) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 17; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 11; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 2, 1. as well as elsewhere in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s and Bra1hman2as. 4) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 15; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 8, 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, viii. 6, 1, 21. He is one of the Ratnins of the king. 5) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 8, 9, 1; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 7, 3, 4; Maitrayan2 Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xv. 4; Satapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 1, 1. Presumably he was appointed by the king, not by the people, to command in war when the king became too important to lead every little fray in person. In the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 6) viii. 23, 10. this official is called Sena1-pati. 

सेलग
सेलग
 in the Bra1hman2as 1) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 1, 5; viii. 11, 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 3, 10. appears to denote ‘robber.’ See Sailaga.

सेहु
सेहु
 occurs in a comparison in the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 76, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 54; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 441. where it must denote a very sapless (arasa) substance.

सैतव
सैतव,
 ‘descendant of Setu,’ is the name of a teacher in the first two Vam2s4as (list of teachers) in the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad. 1) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27 Ma1dhyam2dina; ii. 6, 2 Ka1n2va. He is described as a pupil of Pa1ra1s4arya or of Pa1ra1s4arya1yan2a. 2) iv. 6, 2 Ka1n2va.

सैन्धव
सैन्धव,
 ‘coming from the Indus,’ is a term applied to water in the Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 1) vii. 4, 13, 1. to Guggulu in the Atharvaveda, 2) xix. 38, 2. to a horse in the S4atapatha, Bra1hman2a, 3) xi. 5, 5, 12; Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, vi. 2, 13 (Ma1dhyam2dina = vi. 1, 13 Ka1n2va). and to salt in the same text. 4) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 4, 12 (ºkhilya); iv. 5, 13 (ºghana).

सैलग
सैलग

Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 367, n. 4. as the name of one of the victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’). ‘Robber’ seems to be the sense of this word, as of Selaga. 

सोभरि
सोभरि
 is the name of a R2s2i frequently mentioned in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 5, 26; 19, 2; 20, 19; 22, 2. The family is also referred to, 2) Rv. viii. 19, 32; 20, 8. and a father, Sobhari1. 3) Rv. viii. 22, 15. Cf. viii. 103, 14; Av. xviii. 3, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 105; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 217.

सोम
सोम
 was the famous plant which was used for the preparation of the libation of Soma made at the Vedic sacrifice. Its importance is sufficiently shown by the fact that the whole of the ninth Man2d2ala of the Rigveda, and six hymns in other Man2d2alas, are devoted to its praise. Nevertheless, little is actually known of the plant. Its twigs or shoots are described as brown (babhru), 1) The word is not actually found applied to the plant itself; but the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 5, 3, prescribes arjuna1ni, plants of this indefinite colour, as a substitute for Soma, if Pu1ti1kas cannot be obtained. ruddy (arun2a), 2) Rv. vii. 98, 1; x. 94, 3; 144, 5. Cf. S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 10, 1 et seq. of tawny (hari). 3) Rv. ix. 92, 1. The Soma cow, with which Soma was purchased, is called babhru or arun2a1, S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 1, 15; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 7, 5, etc. Possibly its twigs hang down if the epithet Naica1s4a1kha 4) Rv. iii. 53, 14. Cf. Naica1s4a1kha. refers to the plant as Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-18; 2, 241-245. thinks. The shoot is called am2s4u, 6) Rv. i. 168, 3 iii. 48, 2, etc. while the plant as a whole is called andhas, 7) Rv. i. 28, 7; iii. 48, 1; iv. 16, 1, etc. which also denotes the juice. 8) ii. 14, 1; 19, 1; 35, 1. etc. Parvan 9) Rv. i. 9, 1.

Cf., however, Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 70. ‘finger,’ is used as a designation of the shoots, which may therefore have resembled fingers in shape; vaks2an2a1 11) Rv. viii. 1, 17. and va1n2a 12) Rv. iv. 24, 9; ix. 50, 1. But these passages are both very doubtful. Cf. Va1n2a. The husk left after the pressing is called andhas (ix. 86, 44; vavri (ix. 69, 9), tvac (ix. 86, 44; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, 13, 1), s4ari1va (ibid., 2), s4arya (ix. 68, 2), ta1nva (ix. 78, 1). also seem to have the sense of the shoot. There is some slight. evidence to suggest that the stem was not round, but angular. 13) Cf. pr2s2t2hya in Rv. iv. 20, 4; Hille brandt, 1, 54, 55. The plant grew on the mountains, 14) Rv. i. 93, 6; iii. 48, 2; v. 36, 2; 43, 4; 85, 2; ix. 18, 1; 46, 1; 71, 4; 82, 3; Av. iii. 21, 10. So in the Avesta, Yasna, x. 4, etc. that of Mu7javant being specially renowned. These notices are inadequate to identify the plant. It has been held 15) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 931; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 261 et seq. Cf. Haug, Aitareya Brahman2a, 2, 489; Max Mu7ller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 9, liv. to be the Sarcostemma viminale or the Asclepias acida (= Sarcostemma brevistigma). Roth 16) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 35, 680 et seq. Cf. also 38, 134 et seq. held that the Sarcostemma acidum more nearly met the requirements of the case. Watt 17) See Hillebrandt, 1, 7 et seq. suggested the Afghan grape as the real Soma, and Rice 18) Ibid., 10. thought a sugar-cane might be meant, while Max Mu7ller and Ra1jendrala1la Mitra suggested that the juice was used as an ingredient in a kind of beer--i.e., that the Soma plant was a species of hop. Hillebrandt 19) Ibid., 12. The dispute between Max Mu7ller, Roth, J. G. Baker, W. T. Thiselton Dyer, Charles G. Leland, and A. Houtum-Schindler, as to the identity of the plant, is reprinted in Max Mu7ller's Biographies of Words, 222 et seq., and reviewed by Hillebrandt. See also Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, xxiv. et seq., who thinks that the traditional identification is not far wrong. Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 188, gives it as Sarcostemma acidum. considers that neither hops nor the grape can explain the references to Soma. It is very probable that the plant cannot now be identified. 20) The original Soma plant was, doubtless, identical with the Haoma of the Avesta. On the plant from which the present Parsis of Kerma1n and Yezd obtain their Hu1m juice, and which they regard as identical with the Avestic Haoma, see Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, xxiv et seq. In the Yajurveda 21) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 3, 1, 1 et seq.; Hillebrandt, 1, 89 et seq. the plant is purchased ere it is pressed. Hillebrandt 22) Ibid., 70. considers that the sale must be assumed for the Rigveda. It grew on a mountain, and could not be obtained by ordinary people: perhaps some special tribe or prince owned it, like the Ki1kat2as. 23) Rv. iii. 53, 14. As it stands, the ritual performance is clearly an acquisition of the Soma from the Gandharvas (represented by a S4u1dra), a ritual imitation of the action which may have been one of the sources of the drama. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining the real plant from a great distance, several substitutes were allowed in the Bra1hman2a period. 24) See S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 10, 1-6, and cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, xxvii; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ix. 5, 3. The plant was prepared for use by being pounded with stones or in a mortar. The former was the normal method of procedure, appearing in the Rigveda as the usual one. The stones are called gra1van 25) i. 83, 6; 135, 7, etc. or adri, 26) i. 130, 2; 135, 5; 137, 1, etc. Adri is used oftener with the verb su, ‘press,’ than gra1van, which is more personally conceived, and so appears with vad, ‘speak,’ and so forth; Hillebrandt, 1, 153, n. 1. and were, of course, held in the hands. 27) Rv. v. 45, 7; ix. 11, 5; x. 76, 2, etc. The plant was laid on boards one beside the other (Adhis2avana), and, according at least to the later ritual, 28) Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iv. 4, 28; that a1khara, Rv. x. 94, 5, denotes this is uncertain. a hole was dug below, so that the pounding of the plant by means of the stones resulted in a loud noise, doubtless a prophylactic against demoniac influences. The plant was placed on a skin and on the Vedi 29) Rv. v. 31, 12. --which was no longer done in the later ritual--Dhis2an2a1 in some passages denoting the Vedi. 30) Rv. i. 109, 3; iii. 2, 1; vi. 11, 3, etc. Sometimes the mortar and pestle were used in place of the stones. 31) Rv. i. 28. The pestle is mantha1, the mortar ulu1khala; in x. 101, 11, vanaspati and vana may have the same senses respectively. This use, though Iranian, was apparently not common in Vedic times.

चमू
चमू
 denotes the vessel used for the offering to the god, 32) Not the pressing boards, which are unknown in the Rigveda. Cf. Rv. ix. 99, 8; x. 91, 15, etc. Kalas4a and Camasa those used for the priests to drink from. Sometimes 33) Rv. i. 28, 9; iv. 18, 3; vi. 57, 2, etc.; Hillebrandt, 1, 170, 173. the Camu1 denotes the mortar and pestle. Perhaps the vessel was so called because of its mortar-like shape. The skin on which the shoots were placed was called Tvac, 34) Rv. ix. 65, 25; 66, 29; 70, 7; 79, 4, etc. or twice go (‘cow-hide’). 35) Rv. x. 94, 9; 116, 4. Kos4a, 36) Rv. vii. 101, 4; viii. 20, 8, etc. It denotes the larger vessel from which the Soma is poured into the Kalas4as, or cups. Sadhastha, 37) Rv. iii. 62, 15; ix. 1, 2; 17, 8, etc. Dru, 38) Rv. ix. 1, 2; 65, 6; 98, 2; in x. 101, 10, dru = mortar. Vana, 39) Rv. ii. 14, 9; ix. 66, 9, etc. The word can mean both the vessel into which the Soma was poured after preparation, and the vessel from which it was offered to the gods. Dron2a, 40) Rv. ix. 15, 7; 33, 2, etc. The word, having no definite sense, can denote any of the vessels. The camu1, on the other hand, was the cup for the gods, the kalas4a that for the priests (later it was also used as = kos4a, when camasa had replaced kalas4a as cup for the priests; Hillebrandt, 1, 187). are all terms used for Soma vessels, while Sruva 41) Rv. i. 116, 24. Cf. also Amatra and Kha1ri1. denotes the ‘ladle.’ Apparently the plant was sometimes steeped in water to increase its yield of juice. 42) This process is technically called a1pya1yana, ‘causing to swell.’ Cf. Rv. ix. 74, 9; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 5. The exact nature and extent of this process is quite uncertain; Hillebrandt, 193-195; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, xxvi. It is not possible to describe exactly the details of the process of pressing the Soma as practised in the Rigveda. It was certainly purified by being pressed through a sieve 43) Whether the later practice of purification by means of shoots held in the hands was known to the Rigveda is uncertain, since ii. 14, 8; ix. 71, 3, are quite indecisive. For the various terms used to designate the sieve, see Pavitra. (Pavitra). The Soma was then used unmixed (s4ukra, 44) Rv. i. 137, 1; iii. 32, 2; viii. 2, 10, etc. s4uci) 45) Rv. i. 5, 5; 30, 2; viii. 2, 9, etc. for Indra and Va1yu, but the Kan2vas seem to have dropped this usage. 46) Cf. Rv. viii. 2, 5. 9. 10, 28, etc. The Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 7, 4, disapproves of the unmixed Soma. Possibly Hillebrandt, 1, 207, 208, may be right in thinking that the Ka1n2vas had to lay special stress on the use of the mixtures, because they used a plant which was deficient in the true Soma character. The juice is described as brown (babhru), 47) Rv. ix. 33, 2; 63, 4. 6. tawny (hari), 48) Rv. ix. 3, 9; 7, 6; 65, 8. 12. 25, etc. or ruddy (arun2a), 49) Rv. ix. 40, 2; 45, 3; arus2a, ix. 61, 21; s4on2a, ix. 97, 13. and as having a fragrant smell, 50) ix. 97, 19; 107, 2. at least as a rule. 51) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 3, 6. This passage has been relied on by Eggeling, op. cit., 26, xxv, as a confirmation of the later description, in a medical work, of the plant as illsmelling. But this plant may have been a different one from that used in Vedic times. The smell may have been due to a substitute being used, or to the genuine plant, brought from a distance, being old and withered. Soma was mixed with milk (Gava1s4ir), 52) Hillebrandt, 1, 219-222. curd or sour milk (Dadhya1s4ir), 53) Ibid., 221. or grain (Yava1s4ir). 54) Ibid., 222 et seq. The admixtures are alluded to with various figurative expressions, as Atka, ‘armour’; 55) Rv. ix. 69, 4. Vastra 56) ix. 8, 6. or Va1sas, 57) ix. 69, 5. ‘garment’; Abhis4ri1, 58) ix. 79, 5; 86, 27. ‘admixture’; ru1pa, 59) Av. ix. 25, 4. ‘beauty’; s4ri1, 60) Rv. iv. 41, 8; ix. 16, 6. ‘splendour’; rasa, 61) Rv. iii. 48, 1; vi. 47, 1; ix. 97, 14. See also Su1da. ‘flavour’; prayas, 62) Rv. iii. 30, 1; ix. 46, 3; 66, 23. ‘dainty’; and perhaps nabhas, 63) Rv. ix. 83, 5; 97, 21, etc. ‘fragrance.’ The adjective ti1vra 64) Rv. i. 23, 1; ii. 41, 14; v. 37, 4; vi. 47, 1, etc. denotes the ‘pungent’ flavour of Soma when so mixed. The Soma shoots, after the juice has been pressed out, are denoted by r2ji1s2a, ‘residue.’ 65) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 8, 5; Av. ix. 6, 16, etc.; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xix. 72; citation in Nirukta, v. 12, etc. R2ji1s2a as an adjective occurs in Rv. i. 32, 6, and r2ji1s2in in the Rigveda means, according to Hillebrandt, 1, 236, 237, generally ‘one to whom the Soma shoots belong.’ Soma tiroahnya is ‘Soma pressed the day before yesterday.’ It seems probable that in some cases honey was mixed with Soma: perhaps the kos4a madhu-s4cut, ‘the pail distilling sweetness,’ was used for the mixing. 66) Rv. ix. 103, 3. Cf. ix. 17, 8; ix. 86, 48; 97, 11; 109, 20. It seems doubtful if Sura1 was ever so mixed. 67) See Sura1ma. Cf. Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 12, 5; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxi. 42, and sura1-soma1, ibid., xxi. 60. There were three pressings a day of Soma, as opposed to the two of the Avesta. 68) Yasna, x. 2. The evening pressing was specially connected with the R2bhus, the midday with Indra, the morning with Agni, but the ritual shows that many other gods also had their share. 69) Hillebrandt, 1, 257 et seq. The drinker of Soma and the nondrinker are sharply discriminated in the texts. 70) Rv. i. 110, 7; ii. 30, 7; v. 34, 3. 5; iv. 17, 17; 25, 6. 7; v. 37, 3; vi. 41, 4; vii. 26, 1, etc. There were also rivalries with other Soma sacrifices, Rv. ii. 18, 3; viii. 33, 14; 66, 12, and especially vii. 33, 2, where the Vasis2r2has take away Indra from Pa1s4adyumna Va1yata's Soma sacrifice to Suda1s'. Many famous Soma offerers are mentioned: Atri, v. 51, 8; 72, 1; viii. 42, 5; S4a1rya1ta, i. 51, 12; iii. 51, 7; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, vii. 35; S4i1s2t2as, viii. 53, 4, etc.; Turvas4a Yadu, viii. 45, 27; Sam2varta Kr2s4a, viii. 54, 2; Ni1pa1tithi, Medhya1tithi, Pus2t2igu, S4rus2t2igu, viii. 51, 1, etc. The ritual lays stress on the need of continuity in Soma-drinking in a family: Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 5, 5 et seq.; Maitra1van2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 5, 5, etc. Localities where Soma was consumed were A1rji1ka, Pastya1vant, S4aryan2a1vant, Sus2oma1, the territory of the Pan5cajana1h2 or ‘five peoples,’ and so on. 71) See s.v.; Hillebrandt, 1, 125-143. It is possible that Soma may have grown on the mountains to the north of Madhyades4a, whatever may have been its original home, on which cf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 38, 134 et seq. The effects of Soma in exhilarating and exciting the drinkers are often alluded to. 72) See Rv. viii. 48. It was equally prized in Avestic times. It is, however, seldom spoken of as giving the priests pleasure: Rv. i. 91, 13; viii. 2, 12; x. 167, 3. There are many references to sickness caused by it (Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 2, 13 etc.). The Sautra1man2i1 was a rite designed to expiate the ill caused by vomiting Soma as Indra had done: Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 2, 5, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 4, 9; xii. 7, 1, 11. The name of the rite is already found in Av. vii. 3, 2, and the rite itself is no doubt older (see also Vis2u1cika1). This fact tells in favour of the traditional identification of the plant, for the medical passage quoted by Max Mu7ller refers to its producing vomiting. See also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 275; Rv. i. 91, 13; 118, 3; viii. 2, 12; 17, 6; 48, 12. Perhaps Vamra in i. 112, 15, got his name thence. It is difficult to decide if Soma was ever a popular, as opposed to a hieratic drink. The evidence for its actual popularity is very slight, 73) Rv. viii. 69, 8-10. Cf. viii. 31, 5; i. 28, 5; Hillebrandt, 1, 143-147. The evidence is not decisive; the ordinary Soma sacrifice was clearly a sacrifice of rich patrons. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 272280; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 1-266; 2, 209 et seq.; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 104 et seq. and not decisive.

 in the plural designates the ‘descendants of Suda1s,’ who are referred to in the Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 390 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 47). The story must have appeared in the S4a1t2ya1yanaka also. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 159, n. 3. as having cast S4akti, the son of Vasis2t2ha, into the fire. Other texts 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 7, 1; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, iv. 8; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iv. 7, 3. See also Caland, U7ber das rituelle Su1tra des Baudha1yana, 20. relate that Vasis2t2ha, his son being slain, desired to avenge himself on the Sauda1sas, and eventually succeeded.

 in the Rigveda 1) vii. 2, 1. Cf. i. 24, 7. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 3, 6, 5; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xiii. 4, 4. denotes the ‘top-knot’ of hair as designating the upper part of the head.

स्तृ
स्तृ
 (used in the instrumental plural only) denotes the ‘stars’ of heaven. 1) i. 68, 5; 166, 11; ii. 2, 5; 34, 2; iv. 7, 3; vi. 49, 3. 12. In i. 87, 1, it seems to denote a ‘star-like spot’ on the forehead of a cow or bull, but this is uncertain. Cf. Grassmann, Wo7rterbuch, s.v.; above, 1, 233. 

स्तेग
स्तेग
 in the Yajurveda Sam2hita1s 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 7, 11, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxv. 1. seems to denote a species of ‘worm.’ The word occurs in the Rigveda 2) x. 31, 9 = Av. xviii. 1, 39. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98. also, where its sense is unknown, but may possibly be ‘ploughshare.’ 3) Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 833. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 824.

स्तेन
स्तेन
 is a common word for ‘thief’ from the Rigveda 1) ii. 23, 16; 28, 10; 42, 3, etc. onwards. 2) Av. iv. 3, 4, 5; 36, 7; xix. 47, 6; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 30, 11, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 178 et seq. See Taskara.

स्तेय
स्तेय
 denotes ‘theft’ in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 8, 20; xiv. 1, 57. and later. 2) Nirukta, vi. 27; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iii. 1. Cf. steya-kr2t, ‘thief,’ in Rv. vii. 104, 10. Cf. Dharma.

स्तोतृ
स्तोतृ
 denotes ‘praiser’ or ‘panegyrist’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 11, 3; 38, 4; iii. 18, 5; vi. 34, 3, etc. and later. 2) Av. vi. 2, 1; xix. 48, 4. The word often 3) Rv. i. 124, 10; ii. 1, 16; v. 64, 1; vii. 7, 7; Nirukta, vii. 2. occurs in connexion with patrons, the Maghavan or Su1ri.

स्तोत्र
स्तोत्र
 denotes the ‘song’ of the Udga1tr2 and his assistant priests (see R2tvij), just as S4astra denotes the ‘recitation’ of the Hotr2 and his assistants. The word has this technical sense quite frequently in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 2, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxix. 2; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 37, 4; iii. 46, 8; iv. 12, 6; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xvii. 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 1, 7; viii. 1, 3, 4, etc. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 353, and Caland and Henry, L'Agnis2t2oma, where the Stotras for that sacrifice are given at length. 

स्तोम
स्तोम
 denotes ‘song of praise’ in the Rigveda. 1) i. 114, 9; iii. 5, 2; 58, 1, etc. Later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 1, 2, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ix. 33; x. 10, etc. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 229, 276; 10, 355; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 101. the term has the technical sense of the typical forms in which the Stotras are chanted.

स्त्री
स्त्री
 is the ordinary word in poetry and prose for ‘woman,’ without special reference to her as a wife or as a maiden. Na1ri1 has the same sense, but disappears in later prose, while Gna1 refers only to the wives of the gods, and Yos2it, with its cognate words, denotes the young woman as ripe for marriage. 1) Cf. Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtsehaftsnamen, 417. In the Rigveda 2) Rv. i. 164, 16; v. 61, 8, etc. So also often later--e.g., Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 7, 4; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 8, 2. Stri1 stands opposed to Puma1m2s, ‘man,’ and once to vr2s2an, ‘male person’; not until the Atharvaveda 3) xii. 2, 39. Cf. Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 22, 1. does it mean ‘wife’ as opposed to Pati, ‘husband,’ and even in the Su1tras it is sharply opposed to Ja1ya1. In Vedic India by far the greater part of a woman's life was taken up in her marriage and marital relations (see Pati and Ma1tr2). There is no trace in the Rigveda of the seclusion of women, which was practically complete in all but the earliest Epic: 4) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 349, 350. the maiden may be assumed to have grown up in her father's house, enjoying free intercourse with the youth of the village, and sharing in the work of the house. Education 5) Cf. Hopkins, op. cit., 351, 352. See Ga1rgi1 Va1caknavi1 and others enumerated in the A1s4vala1yana Gr2hya Su1tra, iii. 4, 4; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 118, 119. was not denied to them, at any rate in certain cases, for we hear in the Upanis2ads of women who could take no unimportant part in disputations on philosophical topics. Moreover, women were taught to dance and sing, which were unmanly accomplishments. 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 6, 5, Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iii. 7, 3; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 4, 3-6. Of the exact legal position of daughters the notices are few and meagre. The Rigveda, 7) i. 124, 7. Cf. Av. i. 14, 2; 17, 1; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 328; Hopkins, op. cit., 341, and see Sya1la, Putrika1. however, shows that in the place of a father the brother was looked to for aid, and that brotherless maidens were apt to be ruined, though religious terrors were believed to await the man who took advantage of their defencelessness. 8) Rv. iv. 5, 5. Moreover, women could not take an inheritance, 9) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 5, 8, 2; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, iv. 6, 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 4, 2, 13; Nirukta, iii. 4. and were not independent persons in the eyes of the law, whether married or not. Presumably before marriage they lived on their parents or brothers, and after that on their husbands, while in the event of their husbands predeceasing them, their relatives took the property, burdened with the necessity of maintaining the wife. 10) Cf. the Attic , Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1912, 427. Their earnings would be appropriated by their nearest relative--usually father or brother -in the few cases in which unmarried women could earn anything, as in the case of courtezans.

स्थपति
स्थ-पति
 is the name of a royal official mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 32, 4; v. 23, 11 (of the chief of the worms in both cases). and often later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iv. 5, 2, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xvii. 12; Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 9, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xvi. 19; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 11, 6. 7; xxiv. 18, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 17, etc. Revottaras Ca1kra was the Sthapati of the exiled Dus2t2ari1tu Paum2sa1yana, a king of the Sr2n5jayas, and succeeded in restoring him to his royal dignity. 3) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 8, 1, 17; 9, 3, 1 et seq. Sthapati here is part, as it were, of the name of the man. The exact sense of the term is not certain: ‘governor’ 4) In the Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 1, 12; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, ix. 14, 12, is found Nis2a1da-sthapati; perhaps ‘governor of Nis2a1das.’ But it may also mean (cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 207, n.) a Nis2a1da as a Sthapati; thus, little can be deduced from this passage in particular. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 111, renders it ‘governor.’ Cf. also St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Aupoditi. is possible, but perhaps ‘chief judge’ 5) Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 13, n. 3; 13, 203; 17, 200; 18, 260; U7ber den Ra1jasu1ya, 15, n. 6; U7ber den Va1japeya, 9, 10. Cf. Ka1tya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 5, 28; 11, 11; La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, viii. 7, 11; A1pastamba S4rauta Su1tra, xxii. 7, 6. is more likely; as in the case of the early English judges, his functions may have been both executive and judicial. He is inferior in position to the king's brother. 6) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 4, 4, 17. 

स्थविर
स्थविर,
 literally ‘elder,’ is used as a sort of epithet of several men; Sthavira S4a1kalya occurs in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 1) iii. 2, 1. 6. and the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, 2) vii. 16; viii. 1. 11. and Sthavira Ja1tu1karn2ya in the Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a. 3) xxvi. 5. Cf. the names Hrasva and Di1rgha.

स्थागर

 in the Rigveda 1) i. 59, 1; v. 45, 2; 62, 7; viii. 17, 14; x. 18, 13 (of the grave). and later 2) Av. iii. 12, 6 (of the Vam2s4a, ‘beam,’ being placed on the pillar); xiv. 1, 63; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiv. 1, 3, 7; 3, 1, 22, etc.; sthu1n2a1-ra1ja, ‘main pillar,’ iii. 1, 1, 11; 5, 1, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153. denotes the ‘pillar’ or ‘post’ of a house.

स्नुषा
स्नुषा
 denotes the ‘daughter-in-law’ in relation primarily to her father-in-law, but also to her mother-in-law. In the latter sense the word appears in the Rigveda 1) x. 86, 13. in the epithet su-snus2a1, ‘having a good daughter-in-law,’ used of Vr2s2a1kapa1yi1, while in the former it occurs in several passages, where the daughterin-law's respect for her father-in-law is mentioned, 2) Av. viii. 6, 24; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 22, 7; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, ii. 4, 6, 12. a respect which spirituous liquor alone causes to be violated. 3) Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, ii. 4, 2; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xii. 12 (Indische Studien, 5, 260).

स्यन्दन
स्यन्दन,
 ‘chariot,’ is found in the earlier literature only, if at all, in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) iii. 53, 19, according to Roth. A wood called Syandana seems to be meant in the Kaus4ika Su1tra, viii. 15. where Spandana is the received reading. 

स्याल

स्रज्
स्रज्,
 ‘garland,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) iv. 38, 6; v. 53, 4; viii. 47, 15; 56, 3. and later 2) Av. i. 14, 1 (where it means a ‘cluster of flowers’ from a tree); Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvi. 4, 1; xviii. 3, 2; 7, 6; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xiii. 5, 4, 2, etc. as often worn by men when anxious to appear handsome, as at a wedding and so on. The As4vins are described as ‘lotuswreathed’ (pus2kara-sraj). 3) Rv. x. 184, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 265. 

स्राक्त्य
स्राक्त्य
 is an adjective describing an amulet (Man2i) in the Atharvaveda. 1) viii. 5, 4. 7. 8. Cf. ii. 11. According to Weber, 2) Indische Studien, 13, 164. it designates a crystal (literally ‘many-cornered’). The commentators, 3) See Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 7, 477; Hymns of the Athar vaveda, 577. however, agree in explaining the word to mean ‘derived from the Sraktya’--i.e., from the Tilaka tree (Clerodendrum phlomoides).

स्रुच्
स्रुच्
 denotes a ‘large wooden sacrificial ladle’ (used for pouring clarified butter on the fire) in the Rigveda 1) i. 84, 18; 110, 6; 144, 1, etc. and later. 2) Av. v. 27, 5; vi. 114, 3; ix. 6, 17, etc. Cf. for its shape, etc., Max Mu7ller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 9, xli, lxxx; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 67; 26, 20, 23.

स्रुव,
 as opposed to Sruc, denotes in the ritual literature 1) A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, i. 11, 10, etc. a small ladle used to convey the offering (A1jya) from the cookingpot (Stha1li1) to the large ladle (Juhu1). In the Rigveda, 2) i. 116, 24; 121, 6, etc. Cf. Max Mu7ller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 9, viii; Caland and Henry, L'Agnis2t2oma xliv; Plate I., No. 9; Plate II., No. 11 Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 68; 26, 20. however, it was clearly used for the actual Soma libation.

स्रेकपर्ण
स्रेक-पर्ण
 in the Bra1hman2as 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 6, 6, 3; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, ii. 6, 15. seems to mean ‘like the oleander leaf.’

स्वज
स्वज
 in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 27, 4; v. 14, 10; vi. 56, 2; x. 4, 10, 15, 17; xii. 3, 58. and later 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 10, 2; 14, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, iii. 26, 3. denotes the ‘viper.’ The word is explained by the commentators as sva-ja, ‘self born,’ but Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., gives the alternative vivipara. Weber, 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, 2, 89, n. and Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 95. prefer to derive it from the root svaj, ‘clasp,’ ‘encircle.’ In the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1 6) iii. 9, 3. the Harin2a is said to kill the viper.

स्वधिति
1. Svadhiti in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 9. 18. 20. denotes the ‘axe’ or ‘knife’ used for dissecting the sacrificial horse. In all the other passages in that Sam2hita1 2) ii. 39, 7; iii. 2, 10; 8, 6, 11; v. 7, 8; vii. 3, 9; viii. 102, 19; x. 89, 7. Cf. n. 8. the sense of ‘axe’ for cutting wood is adequate; reference is made in one place 3) ii. 39, 7. to sharpening the axe on the whetstone (ks2n2otra). In the Atharvaveda 4) vi. 141, 2. Cf. Mantra Bra1hman2a, i. 8, 7; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 386, 387; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 159, who is inclined to compare Paras4u in Rv. iii. 53, 22. the term seems once to denote the copper (lohita) 5) Geldner, loc. cit., understands this word to mean ‘red-hot.’ knife used to mark the ears of cattle; the carpenter's knife or axe is also twice referred to there. 6) ix. 4, 6 (probably so to be taken); xii. 3, 33. In xviii. 2, 35, the sense is quite different. See Whitney, op. cit., 845. Later the word means ‘axe’ generally. 7) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 3, 3, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 15 (the slaughteringknife); v. 43 (the axe to fell the tree) etc. As a weapon it does not appear at all. 8) In Rv. x. 92, 15, Svadhiti may refer to the thunderbolt of Indra.

स्वधिति
2. Svadhiti in certain passages of the Rigveda 1) v. 32, 10; ix. 96, 6. Cf. i. 88, 2. denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a great tree with hard wood. This interpretation seems probable.

स्वनद्रथ
स्वनद्-रथ
 (‘having a rattling car’) is taken by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. as a proper name of A1san3ga in the Rigveda. 2) viii. 1, 32. But the word is most probably only an epithet. 

स्वनयभाव्य
स्वनय भाव्य
 is the name of a prince on the Sindhu (Indus) who bestowed gifts on Kaks2i1vant, according to the Rigveda (i. 126, 1. 3). He is called Svanaya Bha1vayavya in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xvi. 11, 5).

स्वप्न
स्वप्न,
 ‘dream,’ is referred to in the Rigveda 1) ii. 28, 10; x. 162, 6. and later. 2) Av. vii. 101, 1; x. 3, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xx. 16; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iii. 2, 2, 23, etc. Evil dreams 3) Rv. ii. 28, 10; Av. x. 3, 6. are often mentioned. The A1ran2yakas of the Rigveda 4) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 4; S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, xi. 3. Cf. Kaus4ika Su1tra, xlvi. 9 et seq.; Atharvaveda Paris4is2t2a, lxviii. contain a list of dreams with their signification, as well as of pratyaks2a-dars4ana1ni, ‘sights seen with one's own eyes.’

स्वर्
स्वर्
 denotes the ‘sun’ 1) i. 71, 2; 105, 3; 148, 1, etc.; Nirukta, ii. 14. and the ‘heaven of light’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 71, 2; 105, 3; 148, 1, etc.; Nirukta, ii. 14. and later. 2) Rv. iii. 2, 7; v. 83, 4; x. 66, 4. 9, etc.; Av. iv. 11, 6; 14, 2, etc.

 denotes in the Upanis2ads 1) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, ii. 22, 5; Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad, i. 2, 1. the sound of a vowel: these are described 2) Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, loc. cit. as being ghos2avant, ‘sonant,’ and also as balavant, ‘uttered with force.’ The precise word for a mute is spars4a, 3) iii. 2, 1, etc. ‘contact,’ while u1s2man denotes a ‘sibilant,’ and svara a ‘vowel,’ in the Aitareya 3) iii. 2, 1, etc. and S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yakas. 4) viii. 1, etc. The semivowels are there denoted by anta-stha1 (‘intermediate’) 5) Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 2, 1. or aks2ara. 6) S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, viii. 1. Another division in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka 7) ii. 2, 4. is into ghos2a, u1s2man, and vyan5jana, apparently ‘vowels,’ ‘sibilants,’ and ‘consonants’ respectively. Ghos2a elsewhere in that A1ran2yaka 8) ii. 2, 2. Cf. Keith's edition, p. 213. seems to have the general sense of ‘sounds.’ The Taittiri1ya Upanis2ad 9) Loc. cit. refers to ma1tra1, a ‘mora’; 10) Also Aitareya A1ran2yaka, iii. 1, 5; Sa1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka, vii. 13. bala, ‘force’ of utterance, and varn2a, ‘letter,’ an expression found elsewhere 11) Aitareya Bra1hman2a, v. 32, 2; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxvi. 5; A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, x. 4; Weber, Indische Studien, v. 32. in the explanation of om, as compacted of a + u + m. The Aitareya A1ran2yaka 12) iii. 1, 3, 5. and the S4a1n3kha1yana A1ran2yaka 13) vii. 10, 12. recognize the three forms of the Rigveda text as pratr2n2n2a, nirbhuja, and ubhayam-antaren2a, denoting respectively the Sam2hita1, Pada, and Krama Pa1t2has of the Rigveda. 14) Max Mu7ller, R2gveda Pra1tis4a1khya, ii. et seq.; Nachtra7ge, ii; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 380 et seq.; Sacred Books of the East, 30, 146 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 51. The same authorities 15) Aitareya, iii. 2, 6; S4a1n3kha1yana, viii. 11. recognize the importance of the distinction of the cerebral and dental n and s, and refer 16) Aitareya, iii. 1, 1; 2, 6; Sa1n3kha1yana, vii. 2; viii. 11. to the Ma1n2d2u1keyas' mode of recitation. They also discuss 17) Aitareya, iii. 1, 2. 3. 5; 2, 2 S4a1n3kha1yana, vii. 13; viii. 1, 2. Sandhi, the euphonic ‘combination’ of letters. The Pra1tis4a1khyas of the several Sam2hita1s develop in detail the grammatical terminology, and Ya1ska's Nirukta 18) See Roth's edition (1852), p. 222, for a list of teachers cited by Ya1ska, especially Kautsa and S4a1kat2a1yana. contains a good deal of grammatical material. The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 19) x. 5, 1, 2. 3. distinguishes the genders, and the Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a 20) x. 9, 1. 2. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 701 et seq. the division of words in the Sa1man recitation.

स्वर्णर
स्वर्-णर
 appears to be the proper name of a sacrificer in two verses of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 3, 12; 12, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 89. According to Geldner, 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 209. it everywhere 3) Rv. iv. 21, 3; v. 18, 4; 14, 1; viii. 6, 39; 65, 2; 103, 14; ix. 70, 6; x. 65, 4. Perhaps in viii. 12, 2, it means ‘coming from Svarn2ara.’ means a specially sacred lake and the Soma-producing district around it.

स्वर्भानुअसुर
स्वर्-भानु असुर
 is the name, in the Rigveda 1) v. 40, 5. 6. 8. 9. and later, 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 1, 2, 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, iv. 5, 2; 6, 13; vi. 6, 8; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 3, 2, 2; Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a, xxiv. 3. of a demon supposed to have eclipsed the sun. See Su1rya.

स्वसर
स्व-सर,
 according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, denotes ‘cattle stall,’ 1) Rv. i. 3, 8; ii. 2, 2; 34, 8; v. 62, 2; viii. 88, 1; Sa1maveda, i. 5, 2, 3, 2. and more generally ‘dwelling-place,’ ‘house,’ 2) Rv. i. 34, 7; iii. 60, 6; 61, 4; vi. 68, 10; viii. 99, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 3, 5, 20. and then ‘nest of birds.’ 3) Rv. ii. 19, 2; 34, 5. Geldner, 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 110-115. however, shows that the real sense is the ‘wandering at will’ of cattle, more precisely their ‘grazing in the morning,’ 5) Rv. i. 3, 8; ii. 2, 2; 34, 8; v. 62, 2; viii. 88, 1. and in the case of birds their ‘early flight’ from the nest, 6) Rv. ii. 19, 2; 34, 5. while metaphorically it is applied first to the morning pressing of Soma and then to all three pressings. 7) Rv. i. 34, 7; iii. 60, 6; vi. 68, 10; viii. 99, 1. In S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, loc. cit., it is equivalent to ‘libation.’

स्वसृ
स्वसृ
 is the regular word from the Rigveda onwards 1) Rv. ii. 32, 6; vi. 55, 4. 5; viii. 101, 15; x. 108, 9, etc. for ‘sister.’ Like the word Bhra1tr2, the term sister can be applied to things not precisely so related. For example, in the Rigveda the fingers and the seasons are ‘sisters,’ and night is the sister of dawn, for whom, as the elder, she makes way. 2) Rv. i. 124, 8. See Delbru7ck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 463; Rv. i. 62, 10; 64, 7, 71, 1, etc. The Pan2is offer to adopt Sarama1 as their sister; 3) Rv. x. 108, 9. but this use is not applied--any more than in the case of Bhra1tr2--to ordinary human beings. The sister stood in a close relation to her brother. If the father was dead or feeble, the sister was dependent on her brother and on his wife, as appears from the Rigveda 4) x. 85, 46. Cf. ix. 96, 22. and the Aitareya Bra1hman2a. 5) iii. 37, 5. Moreover, maidens without brothers were apt to find marriage difficult, and to degenerate into Hetairai; 6) Av. i. 17, 1; Rv. i. 124, 7; iv. 5, 5; Nirukta, iii. 5. but it is not certain whether this was due, as Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 328. thinks, to brothers being required to arrange marriages for orphan girls, or because sonless fathers were anxious to make their daughters Putrika1s, in order that they themselves, instead of the husbands, should count the daughters' sons as their own. 8) Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 22, 48, 49 (on Rv. iii. 31, 1 et seq.). See also Ja1mi.

हरि-यूपीया
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) vi. 27, 5. as the scene of the defeat of the Vr2ci1vants by Abhya1vartin Ca1yamana. It may denote either a place or a river, since many battles seem to have been fought on the banks of rivers. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158. took it as the name of a town on the river Yavya1vati1, which is identified with it in Sa1yan2a's commentary on the passage.

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 18, 19; Kaegi, Rigveda, n. 328. thinks that it is the river Irya1b (Halia1b), a tributary of the Kurum (Krumu), but this is not at all probable.

It was tamed, as the expression Hastipa, ‘elephant-keeper,’ shows, and tame elephants were used to catch others (see Va1ran2a). But there is no trace of its use in war, though Ktesias and Megasthenes both record such use for their times. 7) Von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cidtur, 434. The Atharvaveda 8) Av. iv. 36, 9.

हारिद्रव
हारिद्रव
 is the name of a yellow bird in the Rigveda, 1) i. 50, 12; viii. 35, 7. perhaps the ‘yellow water-wagtail.’ 2) Sa1yan2a on Rv. i. 50, 12; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 7, 6, 2, treats it as the name of a plant (cf.

 ‘descendant of Haridrumant,’ is the patronymic of a Gautama in the Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad (iv. 4, 3).

हालिङ्गव
हालिङ्गव,
 ‘descendant of Halin3gu,’ is the name of a teacher in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (x. 4, 5, 1).

हिता
 in the Bra1hman2as 1) Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad, ii. 1, 21; iv. 2, 4; 3, 20; Kaus2i1taki Upanis2ad, iv. 19. is the name of certain ‘veins.’ Cf. Hira1.

हिम
हिम,
 denoting ‘cold,’ ‘cold weather,’ is quite common in the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 8; 119, 6; viii. 32, 26, etc. but less frequent later. 2) Av. vii. 18, 2; xiii. 1, 46; xix. 49, 5 (night as mother of coolness), etc. As ‘snow’ the word appears as a masculine in the Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, 3) iii. 12, 7, 2. and often later as a neuter. 4) Sad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, vi. 9, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 192-195. Cf. Hemanta.

हिमवन्त्
हिमवन्त्,
 ‘snowy,’ appears as an epithet of mountains in the Atharvaveda. 1) xii. 1, 11. It is also used both there 2) vi. 95, 3. See also iv. 9, 9; v. 4, 2. 8; 25. 7; vi. 24, 1 (where reference is made to the rivers of the Hima1layas); xix. 39, 1. and in the Rigveda, 3) x. 121, 4. as well as later, 4) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 5, 11, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxiv. 30; xxv. 12; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, viii. 14, 3 (the Uttara Kurus and Uttara Madras live beyond it; perhaps in Kas4mi1r), etc. as a noun. There seems no reasen to deny that in all the passages the word refers vaguely to the mountains now called Hima1laya, though it is possible that the name may include mountains not strictly in that system, like the Suleiman hills. 5) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leven, 29; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 12, who inclines to see a reminiscence of the Caucasus. See also Mu1javant and Trikakubh. 

हिमा
हिमा
 denotes ‘winter’ in the combination a ‘hundred winters’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 64, 14; ii. 33, 2; v. 54, 15; vi. 48, 8. and elsewhere. 2) Av. ii. 28, 4; xii. 2, 28; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 6, 6, 3; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, ii. 27.

हिरणिन्
हिरणिन्,
 ‘rich in gold,’ is apparently an epithet of Trasadasyu in one verse of the Rigveda, 1) v. 53, 8. referring to the golden raiment or possessions of the king. Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155. however, thinks the word is a proper name, possibly of Trasadasyu's son.

हिरणिन
हिरणिन
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 63, 9. where Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158. takes the word as a name of S4a1n2d2a. But it seems to be an adjectival form of hiran2in, ‘golden.’

हिरण्य
हिरण्य
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 43, 5; iii. 34, 9; iv. 10, 6; 17, 11, etc. and later 2) Av. i. 9, 2; ii. 36, 7; v. 28, 6; vi. 38, 2, etc. denotes ‘gold.’ It is hardly possible to exaggerate the value attached to gold by the Vedic Indians. The metal was, it is clear, won from the bed of rivers. Hence the Indus is called ‘golden’ 3) Rv. x. 75, 8. and ‘of golden stream.’ 4) Rv. vi. 61, 7; viii. 26, 18. Apparently the extraction of gold from the earth was known, 5) Rv. i. 117, 5; Av. xii. 1, 6. 26. 44. and washing for gold is also recorded. 6) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vi. 1, 7, 1; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, ii. 1, 1, 5. Gold is the object of the wishes of the Vedic singer, 7) Rv. vi. 47, 23; viii. 78, 9; Pischel and Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, xxiv. and golden treasures (hiran2ya1ni) are mentioned as given by patrons 8) Cf. also Hiran2yastu1pa as a proper name. along with cows and horses. Gold was used for ornaments for neck and breast (Nis2ka), for ear-rings (Karn2a-s4obhana), and even for cups. 9) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 7, 1, 3; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 3, 3, 7; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 1, 2, 19; 5, 28. Gold is always associated with the gods. 10) All that is connected with them is of gold; the horses of the sun are hiran2ya-tvacas, ‘gold-skinned’ (Av. xiii. 2, 8), and so on. In the plural Hiran2ya denotes ‘ornaments of gold.’ 11) Rv. i. 122, 2; 162, 16; ii. 33, 9; v. 60, 4; Av. iv. 10, 6; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xv. 50; xx. 37; also in the singular, Av. i. 35, 1; xviii. 4, 56. A gold currency was evidently beginning to be known in so far as definite weights of gold are mentioned: thus a weight, as2t2a1-pru1d2, occurs in the Sam2hita1s, 12) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, iii. 4, 1, 4; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xi. 1; xiii. 10; von Schroeder, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenla7ndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 164. and the golden s4atama1na, ‘weight of a hundred (Kr2s2n2alas)’ is found in the same texts. 13) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, v. 5, 5, 16; xii. 7, 2, 13; 9, 1, 4. Cf. xiii. 1, 1, 4; 2, 3, 2; 4, 1, 13; 2, 7. 13; xiv. 3, 1, 32; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 3, 11, 5; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, viii. 5; xxii. 8; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 101. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 268, is inclined to think that a gold unit is alluded to in the vague phrases ‘thousands,’ etc., of the Rigveda. See viii. 1, 13; 65, 12; x. 95, 3, etc. In several passages, 14) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 7, 4; iii. 8, 2, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 7, 1, 7; xiii. 4, 1, 6, etc. moreover, hiran2ya or hiran2ya1ni may mean ‘pieces of gold.’ Gold is described sometimes as harita, 15) Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, x. 4; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 4, 4, 6; S2ad2vim2s4a Bra1hman2a, ii. 9. ‘yellowish,’ sometimes as rajata, 16) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, i. 5, 1, 2; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, xii. 4, 4, 7; xiii. 4, 2, 10, etc. ‘whitish,’ when probably. ‘silver’ is alluded to. It was obtained from the ore by smelting. 17) S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, vi. 1, 3, 5. Cf. ii. 2, 3, 28; xii. 4, 3, 1; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xvii. 6, 4 (nis2-t2ap, ‘heat’); Jaimini1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 10 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 234, ccxliii); La1t2ya1yana S4rauta Su1tra, iii. 1, 9, etc.; Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a, iii. 34, 6. Megasthenes 18) See Diodorus Siculus, ii. 36; Strabo, pp. 703, 711. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 49-51; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 151. bears testimony to the richness in gold of India in his time.

हिरण्यकशिपु
हिरण्य-कशिपु
 in the Bra1hman2as 1) Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 9, 20, 1; Aitareya Bra1hman2a, vii. 18, 12. Cf. the word as an adjective with the sense of ‘having a golden cloth,’ Av. v. 7, 10. denotes a ‘golden seat,’ probably one covered with cloth of gold.

हिरण्यकार
हिरण्य-कार
 denotes a ‘worker in gold’ mentioned in the list of victims at the Purus2amedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxx. 17; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, iii. 4, 14, 1. 

हिरण्यदन्त्
हिरण्य-दन्त्
 (‘gold-toothed’) Vaida (‘descendant of Veda’) is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a (iii. 6, 3) and the Aitareya A1ran2yaka (ii. 1, 5). The name presumably refers to the use of gold to stop the teeth; see Dant.

हिरण्यनाभ
हिरण्य-नाभ
 is the name of a Kausalya or Kosala prince, whose horse sacrifice appears to be alluded to in the S4a1n3kha1yana S4rauta Su1tra (xvi. 9, 13). He is also referred to in the Pras4na Upanis2ad (vi. 1), and may have been connected with Para A1t2n2a1ra. Cf. Hairan2ya-na1bha.

हिरण्यस्तूप
हिरण्य-स्तूप
 is the name of a man in the Rigveda 1) x. 149, 5. and in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a. 2) i. 6, 4, 2. He is called an A1n3girasa in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a, 3) iii. 24, 11. which credits him with the authorship of a Rigvedic hymn. 4) i. 32. The Anukraman2i1 (Index) ascribes to him several other hymns. 5) i. 31-35; ix. 4, 69. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 104, 141.

हिरण्यहस्त
हिरण्य-हस्त
 is in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 13; 117, 24; vi. 62, 7; x. 39, 7. He appears to be called S4ya1va in x. 65, 12. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 52. the name of a son given by the As4vins to Vadhrimati1 (who, as her name denotes, was the wife of a eunuch).

हिरा
हिरा
 in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 17, 1; vii. 35, 2; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxv. 8. Cf. Weber, Omina und Portenta, 346. denotes ‘vein,’ like Hita1.

हृत्स्वाशयआल्लकेय
हृत्स्व्-आशय आल्लकेय
 is mentioned in the Jaimini1ya Upanis2ad Bra1hman2a (iii. 40, 2) in the Vam2s4a (list of teachers) as a pupil of Somas4us2ma Sa1tyayajn5i Pra1ci1nayogya.

हृदयामय
हृदयामय,
 ‘disease of the heart,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda in connexion with Yaks2ma 1) v. 30, 9. and with Bala1sa. 2) vi. 14, 1; 127, 3. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 387. who thinks that Bala1sa is consumption, connects the name with the later view of the medical Sam2hita1s, 4) Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 321, 322. that love is one of the causes of the disease. But it would be more natural to see in it a disease affecting the heart.

हृद्योत
हृद्-योत
 1) Av. i. 22, 1. Cf. vi. 24, 1. (for Hr2d-dyota) and Hr2d-roga, 2) Rv. i. 50, 11. ‘heart disease,’ are mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Rigveda respectively. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 388. identifies the disease in the Atharvaveda with Hr2daya1maya, ‘consumption caused by love.’ In the Rigveda this is not at all likely: later in the medical Sam2hita1s the word probably denotes angina pectoris. 4) Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 321.

हेमन्
हेमन्
 (used only in the locative singular) denotes ‘winter’ in the later Sam2hita1s and the Bra1hman2as. 1) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, ii. 6, 1, 1; Ka1t2haka Sam2hita1, xxxvi. 6; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 10, 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, i. 5, 4, 5; xi. 2, 7, 32.

हेमन्त
हेमन्त,
 ‘winter,’ occurs only once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 161, 4. but often in the later texts. 2) Av. vi. 55, 2; viii. 2, 22; xii. 1, 36; Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, v. 7, 2, 4; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xiii. 58; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxi. 15, 2; Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a, i. 4, 10, 10; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, x. 4, 5, 2 etc. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 40. is inclined to trace differences of climate in the Rigveda: he thinks that certain hymns, 4) Rv. vii. 103; x. 90. which ignore winter and insist on the rains, indicate a different place and time of origin from those which refer to the snowy mountains. 5) Rv. x. 68, 10; 121, 4 (both these are not early hymns). It is, however, quite impossible to separate parts of the Rigveda on this basis. It is probable that that text owes its composition in the main to residents in the later Madhyades4a; hence the references to cold and snow are rather a sign of local than of temporal differences. It is otherwise with the later expansion of the three into four seasons, which represents clearly the earlier advance of the Indians (see R2tu). The S4atapatha Bra1hman2a 6) i. 5, 4, 5. describes winter as the time when the plants wither, the leaves fall from the trees, the birds fly low and retire more and more.

हैतनामन
हैत-नामन,
 ‘descendant of Hitana1man,’ is the patronymic of a teacher apparently called A1hr2ta in the Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 1) iii. 4, 6. See Pa1n2ini, vi. 4, 170, Va1rttika, and von Schroeder, Maitra1yan2i1 Sam2hita1, 2, ix. though the verse is a strange one.

हैरण्यनाभ
हैरण्य-नाभ,
 ‘descendant of Hiran2yana1bha,’ is the patronymic of Para A1t2n2a1ra, the Kosala king, in a Ga1tha1 occurring in the S4atapatha Bra1hman2a (xiii. 5, 4, 4).

होतृ
होतृ
 is the name of one of the oldest and most important priests of the Vedic ritual, the counterpart of the Zaotar of the Avestan priesthood. 1) Rv. i. 1, 1; 14, 11; 139, 10, etc.; Hotra, the ‘Hotr2's office,’ Rv. ii. 1, 2; 36, 1; 37, 1, etc. The word must be derived from hu, ‘sacrifice,’ as was held by Aurn2ava1bha; 2) Nirukta. iv. 26. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 380 et seq. this indicates a time when the Hotr2 was at once sacrificer (the later Adhvaryu) and singer. But the functions were already clearly divided in the Rigveda, where the Hotr2's chief duty was the recitation of the S4astras. He was also in the older period often the Purohita of the king, an office later filled by the Brahman priest.

होत्रक
होत्रक
 in the Aitareya Bra1hman2a 1) ii. 36, 5; vi. 6, 2. In the Su1tras it is variously used--sometimes in this sense, sometimes more widely--so as to include all the priests except the four chief priests (cf. A1s4vala1yana S4rauta Su1tra, v. 6, 17). denotes ‘assistant of the Hotr2’ priest. 

ह्यस्
ह्यस्
 in the Rigveda 1) viii. 66, 7; 99, 1; x. 55, 5. and later 2) Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xi. 9, 3. denotes ‘yesterday.’

ह्रद
ह्रद
 in the Rigveda 1) i. 52, 7; iii. 36, 8; 45, 3; x. 43, 7; 71, 7; 102, 4; 142, 8, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 15, 4; vi. 37, 2; Pan5cavim2s4a Bra1hman2a, xxv. 10, 18; S4atapatha Bra1hman2a, iv. 1, 5, 12; 4, 5, 10; xi. 5, 5, 8, etc. denotes a ‘lake’ or ‘pond.’

ह्रदेचक्षुस्
ह्रदे-चक्षुस्
 in one passage of the Rigveda 1) x. 95, 6. is thought by Jackson 2) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, May, 1890, iv. to mean ‘will of the wisp.’

ह्रस्वमाण्डूकेय
ह्रस्व माण्डूकेय
 (‘descendant of Man2d2u1ka’) is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya A1ran2yaka. 1) iii. 1, 5; 2, 1. 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391. The word must be regarded as a proper name, given from a personal characteristic, much as Sthavira is used.

ह्रादुनि
ह्रादुनि
 denotes ‘hail’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 13; v. 54, 3. and later. 2) Taittiri1ya Sam2hita1, vii. 4, 13, 1; Va1jasaneyi Sam2hita1, xxii. 26; xxvi. 9, etc.

ह्रूडु
ह्रूडु
 is a word of unknown meaning applied to Takman in the Atharvaveda. 1) i. 25, 2. 3. It is variously spelled in the manuscript as hrud2a, hu1d2u, ru1d2u, and so forth; the Paippala1da recension reads hud2u, ‘ram.’ Henry 2) Journal Asiatique, 9th series, 10, 513. has conjectured that the word is the equivalent of a proto-Semitic h2ara1d2u, ‘gold’ (Assyrian huraçu and Hebrew h2ara1ç), while Hale4vy 3) Ibid., 11, 320 et seq. suggests that it may be the Greek  ‘greenish-yellow’; but both conjectures are highly improbable. 4) Macdonell, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 1106. Weber 5) Indische Studien, 4, 420. Cf. Lanman on Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 26; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 273. thinks ‘cramp’ is meant. 

ह्वरस्
ह्वरस्
 in three passages of the Rigveda 1) ix. 3, 2; 63, 4; 106, 13. denotes, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 278, n.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 203. a part of the Soma sieve, perhaps the part through which the Soma juice flowed. But Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 20 thinks that in all these cases the sense is merely ‘hindrance.’
