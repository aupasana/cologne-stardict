St., pp. 130-32) points out that Chamba is the only place where the ancient word Ca1t2a is still extant in the modern form Ca1d8 meaning ‘the head of a Pargana1’. An important privilege of a gift village was ‘not to be entered by Ca1t2as and Bhat2as’. Inscriptions (Ep. Ind., Vol. XI, p. 221) often specify that the granted land was not to be entered by Ca1t2as and Bhat2as except for seizing robbers and those guilty of harm or treason to the king (cf. a-ca1t2a-bhat2a-praves4yam3 coradrohaka-varjam in op. cit., Vol. VIII, p. 287).

Ya1jn5avalkya, I. 336, speaks of the duty of the king to protect people from the harassment caused by ca1t2as, robbers and Ka1yasthas and the Mita1ks2ara1 explains ca1t2a as persons who deprive people of their wealth after creating false confidence in them. According to Br2haspati quoted by Apara1rka, ‘dangers common to all are those arising from the ca1t2as and thieves’. The word ca1t2a in the passage ta1rkika-ca1t2a-bhat2a-ra1ja1praves4ya in S4an3kara's Bha1sya on the Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad is explained by A1nandagiri by saying that the ca1t2as are those that transgress the rules of conduct for decent people and that bhat2as are servants telling falschood (Ep. Ind., Vol. IX, p. 296). But ca1t2a is used in inscriptions in the sense of a royal official.
